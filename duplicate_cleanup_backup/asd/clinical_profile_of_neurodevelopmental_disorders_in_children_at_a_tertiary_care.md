## Abstract

Background Neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) encompass intricate interactions among genetic, brain, cognitive, emotional, and behavioral processes. These disorders, which are influenced by hereditary and environmental factors, impair personal, social, intellectual, or occupational functioning. Typically emerging early in life, NDDs include conditions such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), intellectual disability, autism spectrum disorders (ASDs), vision and hearing impairments, motor disorders, and specific learning disabilities. Children from impoverished and low-income neighborhoods are particularly vulnerable. The lack of comprehensive health data and public awareness about these conditions results in limited information regarding the prevalence of neurological illnesses in developing countries. India, with its large and ethnically diverse population, exemplifies this gap. Methods It is a prospective study to detect the prevalence and risk factors of neurodevelopmental disorders in children aged six months to nine years at a tertiary care center. Patient details, clinical findings, and relevant history were recorded on a pre-designed pro forma and analyzed statistically. Results Among the 1000 children in the study, 91 (9.1%) tested positive for NDDs. Among the 91 children who tested positive for NDD, the highest frequency is in the three to four years age group (17.6%), males were found to be in a higher ratio with 75.82%, with the male: female ratio being 3:1. Among the 91 children with NDD, intellectual disability was the most common disorder (20.9%), followed by ADHD (17.6%) and vision impairment (14.3%). Autism spectrum disorders, including autism and Asperger syndrome, and communication disorders, including stuttering and speech disorders, accounted for 13.2% each. Hearing loss was seen in 9.9% of children and multiple disorders were seen in 8.8% of the children from among 91 children. Conclusion Neurodevelopmental disorders are common and often coexist with other conditions. Children from low-income backgrounds are more affected. This study provides valuable insights into the prevalence and characteristics of NDDs in a specific population.
