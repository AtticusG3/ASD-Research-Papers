## Abstract

There are large knowledge gaps in the etiology of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and though it is a prevalent and highly heritable neurodevelopmental disorder, diagnosis can be challenging. We aimed to assess the association of circulating blood plasma microRNAs (miRNA) at birth with ADHD, for use as biomarker candidates and build a miRNA-based prediction model. Our study population consisted of 206 ADHD children (33.0% female), 207 control children (33.8% female), and their parents, from the Norwegian Mother, Father, and Child Cohort Study. Expression levels of 51 selected miRNAs in plasma from children's cord blood at birth and from both parents during early pregnancy were quantified by qPCR and tested for association with children's ADHD diagnosis and ADHD symptom scores rated by parents. Seven miRNAs were differentially expressed at birth between ADHD children and controls (False discovery rate <.05) and 31 had a statistically significant linear relationship with parent-rated ADHD symptoms score at eight years. A 19-miRNA ADHD prediction model achieving good discrimination on the test population (AUC = .959, accuracy = .893). Functional analysis for the 19-miRNA prediction-set revealed involvement in several highly relevant pathways, e.g. dopaminergic synapse, circadian rhythm, and axon guidance. We also found parental miRNA expression levels significantly associated with children's ADHD diagnosis and/or ADHD symptoms score. We show that expression levels of circulating miRNAs at birth may be used to predict increased risk of ADHD diagnosis, and our 19-miRNA set should be included in future efforts to develop a biomarker panel.
