## Abstract

Neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs), including autism spectrum disorder (ASD), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and intellectual developmental disorder (IDD), are highly prevalent and lack effective treatments, posing significant health challenges. These disorders are frequently comorbid with disruptions in sleep rhythms, and sleep-related indicators are often used to assess disease severity and treatment efficacy. Recent evidence has highlighted the crucial roles of circadian rhythm disturbances and circadian clock gene mutations in the pathogenesis of NDDs. This review focuses on the mechanisms by which circadian rhythm disruptions and circadian clock gene mutations contribute to cognitive, behavioral, and emotional disorders associated with NDDs, particularly through the dysregulation of dopamine system. Additionally, we discussed the potential of targeting the circadian system as novel therapeutic strategies for the treatment of NDDs.
