## Abstract

In individuals with cognitive decline, depressive symptoms can affect disease progression and quality of life. One factor that may be associated with depressive symptoms is phosphorylated tau (p-tau). However, the association between p-tau and depressive symptoms remains controversial. The present study examined the relationship between p-tau levels and depressive symptoms not only in terms of total scale scores of the 15-item Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS-15) but also at the item level. We conducted a cross-sectional survey of patients ( Multivariable regression analysis revealed that higher levels of p-tau were significantly associated with lower GDS-15 total scores (standardized coefficient [95% confidence interval] = -0.28, [-0.48, -0.09]). Furthermore, patients with higher p-tau levels were less likely to have symptoms of GDS-15 Items 2 (Dropped interests) ( Our findings suggest an association between p-tau accumulation and reduced depressive symptoms. However, future longitudinal studies are required to confirm whether p-tau may be a predictive factor for depressive symptoms.
