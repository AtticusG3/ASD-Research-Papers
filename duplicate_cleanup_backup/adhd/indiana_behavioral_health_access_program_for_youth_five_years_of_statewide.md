## Abstract

This study aimed to evaluate the implementation outcomes and lessons learned from the first 5 years of the Indiana Behavioral Health Access Program for Youth (Be Happy), a statewide child psychiatry access program (CPAP) designed to support primary care providers (PCPs) in addressing pediatric mental health needs. Program utilization data were analyzed, including PCP characteristics, consultation characteristics, psychiatrist impressions, and PCP feedback. From 2019 to 2024, Be Happy received 3,031 consultation requests guiding behavioral health care for children and adolescents residing in 87 of Indiana's 92 counties. Calls often addressed medication management and therapy recommendations for patients with conditions such as anxiety, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, and depression. Consultations were completed on the same day, with one-half of cases managed entirely within the primary care setting. PCPs reported high satisfaction with Be Happy, citing increased confidence in addressing pediatric mental health needs, managing medications, and providing information about therapy resources. The Be Happy program demonstrates the utility of CPAPs in addressing workforce shortages, empowering PCPs, and improving access to mental health care for children and adolescents. Key lessons included the need for targeted outreach to rural areas and the importance of embedding CPAP awareness into health care training programs. Future research should explore patient-level outcomes and strategies to sustain and expand the impact of CPAPs.
