## Abstract

Diverse neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) subtypes are expressed in hippocampal interneurons. Single-cell analysis of mRNA expression previously revealed prominent co-expression of the α3 and β2 subunits within rat interneurons in the CA1 region. Although the α3 subunit (traditionally expressed together with β4) is usually associated with the peripheral nervous system, its significant co-expression with the β2 subunit in hippocampal interneurons suggests a distinct, potentially novel central nervous system nAChR subtype. We demonstrate that the human α3 and β2 subunits injected into
