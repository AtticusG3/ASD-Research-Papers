Long-term use of cannabis-based medicines in two children with Tourette syndrome: a case report.,"Cannabis-based medicine (CBM) is recommended for the treatment of tics in otherwise treatment-resistant adult patients with Tourette syndrome (TS). However, evidence in children with TS is very limited. Long-term effects of CBM in this population are unknown.
We present two cases of long-term follow-up over six and five years, respectively, in male adolescents with TS who were administered CBM starting at the age of eight and 12 years, respectively. In one patient CBM treatment was initiated with pure tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and was later changed to current treatment with an oral THC-dominant cannabis extract (THC:cannabidiol (CBD)=25:<0.5) with a daily dose of 0.5-0.6 mL (corresponding to 12.5-15 mg THC/day). The other patient was from the beginning up to now medicated by his parents, who are physicians, with vaporized THC-dominant (24%) medicinal cannabis flowers with a dose of 0.2 g between once to thrice per day (corresponding to 48-144 mg THC/day). While in one patient, there was a moderate dose increase over the years, in the other patient dosages were adjusted individually depending on tic severity. In both patients, CBM treatment resulted in continued benefit with significant improvement of tics and psychiatric comorbidities without severe adverse effects. Academic performance of both adolescents was excellent. Neurocognitive assessments demonstrated average results in the domain of working memory and average to above average results in the domain of processing speed.
We present two cases of minors with TS who started CBM treatment at the age of eight and 12 years, respectively, and continued treatment for five to six years resulting in clinically relevant symptom improvement without any severe adverse effects or negative impact on cognitive and academic performance.",Frontiers in psychiatry,2025-10-20,"['Lara-KatharinaWoerner', 'NataliaSzejko', 'CarolinFremer', 'SimonSchmitt', 'Kirsten RMüller Vahl']",10.3389/fpsyt.2025.1647969,tourette_syndrome,tourette syndrome,pubmed
The effectiveness of acupuncture in the treatment of Tourette syndrome in Chinese children: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"As a prominent complementary and alternative therapy, acupuncture is widely used to treat Tourette syndrome in children. This review aims to evaluate its clinical efficacy and provide evidence-based support for acupuncture in pediatric Tourette syndrome.
We systematically searched six databases: China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang Database, VIP Information Chinese Journal Service Platform, PubMed, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Embase, from their inception to 10 April 2025. Randomized controlled trials comparing acupuncture alone versus medication, or acupuncture plus other treatments versus other treatments alone, for children tic disorder were included.
Thirty-two studies were included, with 2,201 participants. Acupuncture may be more effective in improving motor tics symptoms than dopamine agonist [WMD -3.04, 95% CI (-3.77, -2.31), RD 0.38 (0.29, 0.46)], slightly improving vocal tics [WMD -2.39, 95% CI (-3.51, -1.26), RD 0.21 (0.10, 0.35)] and overall condition [WMD -5.56, 95% CI (-7.28, -3.83), RD 0.05 (0.02, 0.09)], but having little difference in functional impairment [WMD -2.27, 95% CI (-3.58, -0.96), RD 0.14 (0.09, 0.20)]. Acupuncture may be more effective than blank treatment on basis of other therapies in improving motor tics [WMD -2.51, 95% CI (-3.54, -1.49), RD 0.31 (0.19, 0.41)] and vocal tics [WMD -2.56, 95% CI (-3.66, -1.45), RD 0.28 (0.15, 0.40)], but slightly improving functional impairment [WMD -2.91, 95% CI (-4.64, -1.19), RD 0.13 (0.05, 0.23)] and overall symptom severity [WMD -5.57, 95% CI (-7.47, -3.68), RD 0.11 (0.06, 0.17)].
Chinese children with Tourette syndrome using acupuncture may experience more improvement in motor tics symptoms than those using dopamine agonist. Acupuncture combined with other therapies may bring Chinese children with Tourette syndrome symptom relief in motor tics and vocal tics more than those alone. All results are supported by low-quality evidence.

Abnormal development of corticospinal tracts in children with Tourette syndrome: A single-center retrospective study.,"To explore the abnormal changes and localization of never fiber bundles on magnetic resonance imaging diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in children with Tourette syndrome, children with Tourette syndrome were retrospectively enrolled to undergo three-dimensional (3D) T1 + DTI sequence scanning, raw data collection of 1 to 15 year old head, and cross-sectional spacing of 0.5 mm on DTI scanning. The specific software was used to display relevant nerve fiber bundles on DTI. In total, 7 children with Tourette syndrome were enrolled including 6 boys and 1 girl aged 3 to 10 (5.6 ± 2.3) years. The symptoms included paroxysmal shoulder convulsions, facial muscle twitching, involuntary blinking, right hand twitching, epilepsy, involuntary shrug, and attention deficit. On DTI, the morphology and course of the corticospinal tracts were damaged or abnormal, the inferior frontal occipital tracts were damaged or abnormal, the fiber bundles in the compression part of the corpus callosum were reduced in the number and abnormal in the morphology, and the brain nerve fiber bundle connection was reduced. In conclusion, the nerve fiber bundle connection and damage and abnormality of the morphology and course of the corticospinal tract, fiber bundles of the compression part of the corpus callosum, and the inferior frontal occipital tract in children with the Tourette syndrome can be clearly observed on DTI, and the DTI technique can provide valuable imaging support for revealing the neuropathological mechanism of the Tourette syndrome in children.",Medicine,2025-10-15,"['Hong-XinJiang', 'Yan-MeiJu', 'Ting-TingGao', 'Jian-LiSun', 'Hong-GangWang', 'LeiCao', 'Shu-ManHan', 'Hui-ZhaoWu', 'Jin-XuWen', 'Bu-LangGao', 'Wen-JuanWu']",10.1097/MD.0000000000044702,tourette_syndrome,tourette syndrome,pubmed
Neuromodulation for Tourette syndrome: current techniques and future perspectives.,"Tourette syndrome (TS) is a chronic tic disorder characterized by motor and vocal tics. Neuropsychiatric symptoms are nearly universal in TS, particularly attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). TS can have substantial effects on quality of life, social and intellectual development, opportunities, relationships, and more. Treatment options are limited; the most common being behavioral therapy and pharmacological interventions, such as antipsychotics and anti-adrenergic agents, often yielding unsatisfactory benefits. Neuromodulation, the alteration of neural pathways and networks under external stimulation, has been established as a viable treatment strategy for specific aspects of TS. Several neuromodulation techniques have been utilized, with deep brain stimulation (DBS) exhibiting the strongest efficacy at around 50% reduction of tics on average across cohorts. However, the invasive nature of DBS remains a disincentive for its uptake, as well as the natural reduction in tic severity for many TS individuals as they enter adulthood. Less-invasive neuromodulation has also been explored, but efficacy remains limited. Given its effectiveness in TS, DBS provides the unique opportunity to record neural activity from deep brain structures, which has been used to investigate underlying pathophysiology and search for biomarkers of treatment response. These insights may guide strategies for less invasive neuromodulation. In this narrative review, we aim to discuss currently utilized neuromodulation therapies for the treatment of TS, as well as propose potential future strategies. Additionally, we discuss how to maximize progress in the field, including crucial multicenter data sharing, utilization of recording capabilities on DBS devices, correlation with the precise location of implanted electrodes, and harnessing pre-clinical studies for a more parameterized understanding of TS neuromodulation. These techniques will enable a clearer understanding of TS and the mechanisms behind successful treatment. This could lead to advanced therapies that improve the quality of life for individuals with TS.",Journal of neural engineering,2025-10-14,"['SarahHaslam', 'Kara AJohnson', 'DariaAnderson', 'NeilMahant', 'CollinAnderson']",10.1088/1741-2552/ae1257,tourette_syndrome,tourette syndrome,pubmed
Nonmotor Symptom Scales in Children With Movement Disorders: A Scoping Review.,"Nonmotor symptoms (NMSs) in pediatric movement disorders, such as tics, dystonia, and cerebral palsy (CP), are important to consider but can be often overlooked, despite their substantial impact on daily functioning and quality of life. Understanding which NMSs are evaluated in these patient groups, and by which tools, can support the shaping of future research, including the potential development of future dedicated NMS assesment instruments. The aim of this scoping review was to identify the scales and tools used in routine practice and/or in research to assess NMSs in children with movement disorders.
A comprehensive search of MEDLINE, Embase, and PsycINFO was conducted for studies published between 1990 and 2023. Eligible studies included those that evaluated NMSs using scales in children aged 0-18 years with tic disorders, dystonia, or CP.
A total of 382 studies were included. Most of the articles identified were cross-sectional, cohort, and case-control studies. Cognitive impairment, mental health, behavioral difficulties, and pain were most frequently assessed using standardized scales. However, self-esteem and communication-critical components of social functioning-were rarely evaluated. The assessment of sleep disturbance, fatigue, and gastrointestinal and urinary symptoms was also less frequently addressed. Notably, our methodological approach may have led to an overrepresentation of NMS assessment in CP, given the larger body of literature available for this condition.
Significant gaps exist in the evaluation of NMSs in pediatric movement disorders, particularly in areas such as pain, sleep, and gastrointestinal issues. While standardization of NMS assessment is needed, it is unclear whether disorder-specific tools are preferable to broader NMS-focused measures. Given the current lack of data, using general scales may be a pragmatic first step, with refinement into disorder-specific tools as our understanding of symptom patterns evolves. Cross-cultural validation is also essential to improve the applicability of NMS scales across diverse populations. Integrating NMS assessment into routine clinical practice and interdisciplinary care may facilitate early identification and better management of these symptoms.",Neurology,2025-10-17,"['ClémentDesjardins', 'ChristelleNilles', 'HortensiaGimeno', 'Kathryn JPeall', 'DavideMartino', 'TamaraPringsheim', 'EmmanuelRoze']",10.1212/WNL.0000000000214289,tourette_syndrome,tic disorder,pubmed
Symptoms and sleep characteristics of tic disorder children with allergic diseases: a case-control study.,"Recent studies have shown a close relationship between tic disorder (TD) and allergic diseases in children. Allergic diseases also have a significant impact on children's sleep. Regrettably, it remains unclear whether TD children with comorbid allergic diseases exhibit distinct symptoms and sleep characteristics.
This study aimed to explore the symptoms and sleep characteristics of TD children with allergic diseases.
This was a case-control study involving 242 TD children (aged 3-14 years), of whom 168 had allergic diseases and 74 did not have allergic diseases. General information and allergy histories were recorded for all participants. The Yale Global Tic Severity Scale (YGTSS) was used to assess TD symptoms. All guardians of TD children were required to complete the Children's Sleep Habits Questionnaire (CSHQ).
Compared with the group of TD children without allergic diseases, the comorbid allergic disease group had significantly higher impairment scale scores and total tic scores on the YGTSS (all

Mental Health and Psychosocial Support During the Perioperative Period.,"Gender-affirming care (GAC) encompasses a comprehensive, patient-centered approach designed to support individuals in affirming their gender identity and expression. It includes a spectrum of medical, surgical, behavioral, social, psychological, and legal interventions tailored to the unique needs of each person. The mental and behavioral health needs of transgender and gender-diverse (TGD) individuals are highly individualized, requiring clinicians to provide care that is responsive to patients' mental and medical health needs. Before addressing perioperative psychosocial concerns, it is essential to understand the significant role mental health plays in the overall well-being of TGD individuals. Gender affirming providers with training in psychiatry, psychology, social work, and counseling are instrumental in supporting the mental health needs of TGD individuals. Perioperatively, this support can manifest in helping manage life stressors, treatment of underlying mental health disorders, conducting pre-surgical readiness assessment, and continued post-operative guidance.",Clinics in plastic surgery,2025-10-16,"['KalieGiovanni', 'RomySmith', 'LukeMuschialli', 'RachelBigley', 'KateThomas']",10.1016/j.cps.2025.06.009,tourette_syndrome,tic disorder,pubmed

Unraveling ADHD for the pediatrician.,"To review current evidence on the pathophysiology, clinical features, differential diagnosis, and therapeutic management of Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), emphasizing the pediatrician's role in diagnostic recognition and coordination of multidisciplinary care.
Narrative synthesis of the contemporary literature addressing genetic and neurobiological underpinnings, diagnostic criteria, comorbidities, and treatment strategies relevant to pediatric practice.
ADHD is a multifactorial neurodevelopmental disorder involving genetic predisposition and neurobiological alterations, particularly in cortico-subcortical circuits related to dopaminergic and noradrenergic modulation. Clinical presentation varies with age and context and may be accompanied by comorbidities such as learning disorders, anxiety, and depression. Diagnosis is clinical, based on standardized criteria and assessment across multiple settings, and requires exclusion of conditions that mimic ADHD. Management is multimodal, encompassing psychosocial interventions, school-based support, and, when indicated, pharmacological therapy. Pediatricians serve as the first point of contact and play a central role in early identification, family guidance, and integration of healthcare and educational teams.
Proactive pediatrician involvement is essential for early diagnosis and effective management of ADHD, supporting better prognosis and the child's overall development.",Jornal de pediatria,2025-10-21,"['Erasmo BarbanteCasella', 'Beatriz BorbaCasella']",10.1016/j.jped.2025.101464,adhd,ADHD,pubmed
Psychotic symptoms during pharmacological treatment of ADHD: clinical considerations and research needs.,"In this Personal View, we address key questions to support evidence-based prevention and management of psychotic symptoms that might occur during ADHD pharmacotherapy. We begin by examining evidence showing a significantly increased occurrence of psychotic disorders in individuals with ADHD, independent of ADHD medications (pooled relative risk, odds ratio, or hazard ratio=4·74, 95% CI 4·11-5·46). We then examine whether ADHD medications play a causal role, noting that current evidence does not support such a causal link, at least for methylphenidate. We explore how vulnerability to psychosis varies across individuals with ADHD. Regarding the different steps involved in prescribing ADHD medications, we discuss the importance of balancing potential risks-such as emergence of psychotic symptoms-against the demonstrated benefits of pharmacological treatment for ADHD. Next, we present strategies for screening individuals for vulnerability to psychosis before initiating ADHD medication. We then offer guidance on the clinical management of psychotic symptoms that might arise during ADHD pharmacotherapy, including considerations of dosage and medication type. Finally, we identify key research priorities in this area. Overall, this paper provides an empirical framework, grounded in evidence and clinical practice, to guide the next steps in the field.",The lancet.

"Promoting Collaboration Among Pediatrics, Education, and Law in a Preschooler With Co-occurring Attention-deficit Hyperactivity Disorder and Cerebral Palsy.","Marcus is a 4-year-old African-American boy with cerebral palsy, Gross Motor Function Classification System level 1, and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), Combined Presentation who presents to Developmental-Behavioral Pediatrics clinic for evaluation because of preschool difficulties. He is very active, jumping up and down at circle time, bumping into classmates, and impulsively hitting other children when they take his toys. As a toddler, his cognitive and social-emotional skills were on track, and he received early intervention for language and motor delays. He qualified for an IEP and transitioned to a district-based inclusive preschool setting with speech therapy and adaptive physical education. Marcus spends the week with his grandparents, and they live in a school district that is well-resourced and has inclusive school and therapy settings. The teachers call parents or grandparents frequently to pick him up. In response to misbehavior, they also put him in a separate timeout area, away from the other children, with a 1:1 aide for the rest of the day. On 2 occasions, he was strapped into a therapy chair for nonambulatory children after biting or hitting another child. Because he does well with 1:1 support, the school has switched him to a special day class with smaller class size, comprised primarily of autistic preschoolers who are minimally verbal. Marcus' parents have just started parent training in behavior management for ADHD after struggling to find a therapist that was covered by their insurance. His mother noticed while volunteering in his original class that other children with similar behavior were not sent home or transferred to a special education class. They are upset with the transfer to the more restrictive environment, but they are worried if they speak up that the district will send him to a less resourced school in the district where the family, rather than grandparents, reside.

Are prediction error modifications domain specific in autism but domain general in ADHD?,"In the last decade, several theories have proposed explanations of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) based on the Bayesian Brain hypothesis. Research on repetition suppression suggests that neural correlates of prediction errors in ASD might be domain specific with larger differences for faces than for objects. Contrastingly, research assessing mismatch negativity in attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) indicates domain-generally modified prediction errors. Therefore, we captured neural correlates of prediction errors to colours and emotions in adults with ADHD or ASD to assess domain specificity of prediction error modifications. We used a multi-feature roving paradigm where we assessed predictive processes regarding unattended, task-irrelevant faces. We extracted task specific precision-weighted prediction errors and prediction strength for emotions and colours of the faces separately using a generative model, specifically a Hierarchical Gaussian Filter. While we found neural correlates of colour precision-weighted prediction errors and prediction strength as well as emotion prediction strength in the pooled sample regardless of group, we did not find any differences in neural correlates of emotion or colour precision-weighted prediction errors or prediction strength between our groups. These results suggest preserved neural correlates of precision-weighted prediction errors in ASD and ADHD for low-level visual features and potentially complex social information.","Imaging neuroscience (Cambridge, Mass.)",2025-10-20,"['Irene SPlank', 'AnnaYurova', 'AlexandraPior', 'JuliaNowak', 'Afton MBierlich', 'BorisPapazov', 'ZhuanghuaShi', 'Christine MFalter-Wagner']",10.1162/IMAG.a.942,adhd,ADHD,pubmed
"Effect of Tirzepatide in an Adolescent With Early-Onset Obesity, Hyperphagia, and Type 2 Diabetes.","Early-onset severe obesity is rare and largely treatment-resistant to standard measures.

Autism spectrum disorder-risk genes have convergent effects on transcription and neuronal firing patterns in primary neurons.,"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a highly heterogenous neurodevelopmental disorder with numerous genetic risk factors. Notably, a disproportionate number of risk genes encode transcription regulators including transcription factors and proteins that regulate chromatin. Here, we test the function of nine such ASD-linked transcription regulators by depleting them in primary cultured neurons. We then define the resulting gene expression disruptions using RNA sequencing and test effects on neuronal firing using multielectrode array recordings. We identify shared gene expression signatures across many ASD-risk genes that converge on the disruption of critical synaptic genes. Fitting with this, we detect robust disruptions to neuronal firing throughout neuronal maturation. Together, these findings provide evidence that the loss of multiple ASD-linked transcriptional regulators disrupts transcription of synaptic genes and has convergent effects on neuronal firing that may contribute to enhanced ASD risk.",Genome research,2025-10-21,"['AlekhParanjapye', 'RiliAhmad', 'StevenSu', 'Abraham JWaldman', 'Jennifer EPhillips-Cremins', 'ShuoZhang', 'EricaKorb']",10.1101/gr.280698.125,asd,autism spectrum disorder,pubmed

Phenotypic Description of Autism Spectrum Disorder and Psychopathology in Maternal 15q Duplication Syndrome.,"Maternal 15q11-q13 duplication syndrome (Dup15q) has been associated with 0.5% of all cases of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). There is no established protocol for the neuropsychiatric evaluation of individuals with this syndrome. This study aims to define a protocol incorporating gold standard assessments.
Six individuals with Dup15q underwent assessment of cognitive and adaptive functioning (Leiter-3, Adaptive Behavior Assessment System-Second Edition), autistic traits (Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule-2 [ADOS-2], Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised [ADI-R], Social Communication Questionnaire, Social Responsiveness Scale, Repetitive Behaviors Scale-R), co-occurring psychopathology (Kiddie Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia, Child Behavior Checklist, Swanson, Nolan, and Pelham-Forth Edition, Sleep Disturbance Scale for Children), and family functioning (Parenting Stress Index-Short Form, PedsQL). Parents were required to fill the Symptom Checklist 90 (SCL-90) and Autism-Spectrum Quotient (AQ) to gather information about their psychiatric co-occurrences and autistic traits. A molecular analysis was performed to confirm the genetic alteration.
Two siblings inherited the duplication through maternal transmission, whereas 4 individuals had a de novo maternal duplication. No participant exhibited preserved cognitive abilities; 4 of 5 showed below average adaptive functioning and 2 of 6 received a diagnosis of ASD. ADOS-2 revealed greater difficulties in the Social Affect domain compared with the Repetitive and Restricted Behaviors domain (p < 0.05), findings confirmed by ADI-R (p < 0.05). K-SADS indicated clinical scores in 5 individuals, with anxiety disorder in 3 participants. High levels of parental stress and a poor quality of life were reported. The mother carrier of the duplication showed clinical scores on the ""Positive Symptom Total"" of the SCL-90 and on the AQ.

Transition From Children's to Adults' Healthcare for Youth With (Genetic) Intellectual Disabilities: An ERN-ITHACA Guideline.,"For young people with rare genetic neurodevelopmental disorders associated with intellectual disabilities, the transfer from paediatric to adult healthcare providers is often complicated. The European Reference Network ERN-ITHACA (Intellectual disability, TeleHealth, Autism and Congenital Anomalies) on Rare Congenital Malformations and Rare Intellectual Disability aims to improve this transition through the development of a guideline.
Population-specific recommendations for the optimal transition to adult healthcare were developed by an interdisciplinary consortium, representing clinical, scientific and lived experience experts from nine European countries. Recommendations of the 2016 National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guideline 'Transition From Children's to Adults' Services for Young People Using Health or Social Care Services' (NG43) were adapted, based on a literature review, expert opinion and lived experiences gathered through a survey, focus groups and discussions with self-advocates. A consensus meeting was held in Gdańsk, Poland, in October 2024.
NICE guideline recommendations were adopted or adapted to the target population where necessary. New recommendations were formulated regarding the involvement of and assistance for young people and their families/caregivers, the coordination of interdisciplinary care, the role of centres of expertise, recommended interventions and psychosocial support.
Planned, coordinated, specialised, individualised and interdisciplinary healthcare is required to support young people with (genetic) intellectual disabilities.

Familial Molecular Burden in Autism Spectrum Disorder: A Next-Generation Sequencing Study of Polish Affected Families.,"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a heritable neurodevelopmental condition with a complex genetic architecture. Dissecting the interplay between inherited variants and high-impact de novo variants is critical for understanding its etiology. We conducted a family-based study involving 42 families with ASD (139 individuals). Using a targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) panel of 236 genes, we identified and characterized rare inherited and de novo variants in affected probands, parents, and unaffected siblings. Our analysis revealed a complex genetic landscape marked by diverse inheritance patterns. De novo variants were predominantly observed in individuals with atypical autism, while biparental (homozygous) inheritance was more common in Asperger syndrome. Maternally inherited variants showed significant enrichment in intronic regions, pointing to a potential regulatory role. We also detected variants in several high-confidence ASD risk genes, including ",International journal of molecular sciences,2025-10-16,"['MonikaWawszczak-Kasza', 'JarosławRachuna', 'ŁukaszMadej', 'WojciechLewitowicz', 'PiotrLewitowicz', 'AgataHorecka-Lewitowicz']",10.3390/ijms26199672,asd,asperger syndrome,pubmed
Clinical and demographic characteristics of patients with autism spectrum disorder receiving general anesthesia with or without physical restraint: a single-center retrospective study.,"Perioperative management of patients with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) often requires premedication and physical restraint. This study examined the characteristics of patients with ASD who required special interventions for general anesthesia, particularly physical restraint during induction.
This retrospective study included patients diagnosed with ASD (autism, pervasive developmental disorder, Rett syndrome, Asperger's syndrome, or childhood disintegrative disorder) based on established criteria. All patients underwent general anesthesia at a hospital for patients with disabilities between April 2019 and March 2022. Data collected included clinical and demographic characteristics, perioperative management (premedication and anesthetic methods), surgical indications, physical restraint use, and induction time. A comparative analysis was conducted to identify differences in patient characteristics and induction times between physical restraint and no-restraint groups. Induction times were compared using Kaplan-Meier survival curves and log-rank tests.
A total of 136 procedures were performed on 102 patients. Median age was 23.3 years (interquartile range: 12.8-35.2), 79% of participants were male, and approximately 40% exhibited self-injurious or aggressive behaviors. Dental procedures were the most common indication for anesthesia. Midazolam and pentobarbital were the most frequently administered premedications. Patients requiring physical restraint were generally larger and more likely to exhibit self-injurious or aggressive behaviors than those who did not. However, induction times were not prolonged in the physical restraint group compared with the no-restraint group.
The characteristics identified in this study, such as large body size, self-injurious behavior, and aggressive behavior, may inform future research aimed at refining physical restraint use for patients with ASD.",Journal of anesthesia,2025-10-04,"['HidekazuIto', 'TatsuyaTsuji', 'KazuyaSobue']",10.1007/s00540-025-03592-w,asd,asperger syndrome,pubmed
Diagnostic challenges of autism spectrum disorder in women without intellectual or language impairments: a narrative review.,"Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) in adult women without intellectual or language impairments is frequently under-recognized, due to subtler manifestations, greater use of compensatory social strategies, and reliance on diagnostic frameworks developed from male presentations. Diagnostic overshadowing, where autistic traits are misattributed to other psychiatric conditions, further delays accurate identification. This narrative review aims to critically evaluate recent evidence on the diagnostic challenges of ASD in adult women without intellectual or language impairments, assess the performance of widely used screening tools, and present recommendations for improving gender-sensitive diagnostic practices. A structured literature search was applied (PubMed, PsycINFO, Scopus; January 2010-July 2025; English language) targeting studies on females aged ≥18 years without intellectual or language impairment. Diagnostic accuracy, screening tools, camouflaging, misdiagnosis, and psychosocial outcomes were examined. Original research, meta-analyses, and systematic reviews were included, and a narrative synthesis approach was chosen due to study heterogeneity. Female-typical presentations often include subtle social-communication differences, context-specific restricted interests, and higher camouflage levels than males, which decrease the sensitivity of standard screening tools. Women are more likely to receive prior psychiatric diagnoses before ASD is recognized, contributing to mental health burdens and poorer functional outcomes. Current adult ASD screening tools have limited capacity to detect female phenotypes. Integrating camouflaging assessment, nuanced developmental histories, and updated, gender-inclusive screening instruments is essential to improving diagnostic equity.",Journal of medicine and life,2025-09-29,"['AlexandraDolfi', 'CătălinaTudose']",10.25122/jml-2025-0118,asd,asperger syndrome,pubmed
"VAE deep learning model with domain adaptation, transfer learning and harmonization for diagnostic classification from multi-site neuroimaging data.","In large public multi-site fMRI datasets, the sample characteristics, data acquisition methods, and MRI scanner models vary across sites and datasets. This non-neural variability obscures neural differences between groups and leads to poor machine learning based diagnostic classification of neurodevelopmental conditions. This could be potentially addressed by domain adaptation, which aims to improve classification performance in a given target domain by utilizing the knowledge learned from a different source domain by making data distributions of the two domains as similar as possible. In order to demonstrate the utility of domain adaptation for multi-site fMRI data, this research developed a variational autoencoder-maximum mean discrepancy (VAE-MMD) deep learning model for three-way diagnostic classification: (i) Autism, (ii) Asperger's syndrome, and (iii) typically developing controls. This study chooses ABIDE-II (Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange) dataset as the target domain and ABIDE-I as the source domain. The results show that domain adaptation from ABIDE-I to ABIDE-II provides superior test accuracy of ABIDE-II compared to just using ABIDE-II for classification. Further, augmenting the source domain with additional healthy control subjects from Healthy Brain Network (HBN) and Amsterdam Open MRI Collection (AOMIC) datasets enables transfer learning and improves ABIDE-II classification performance. Finally, a comparison with statistical data harmonization techniques, such as ComBat, reveals that domain adaptation using VAE-MMD achieves comparable performance, and incorporating transfer learning (TL) with additional healthy control data substantially improves classification accuracy beyond that achieved by statistical methods (such as ComBat) alone. The dataset and the model used in this study are publicly available. The neuroimaging community can explore the possibility of further improving the model by utilizing the ever-increasing amount of healthy control fMRI data in the public domain.",Frontiers in neuroinformatics,2025-09-29,"['GopikrishnaDeshpande', 'BonianLu', 'NguyenHuynh', 'DRangaprakash']",10.3389/fninf.2025.1553035,asd,asperger syndrome,pubmed
Dealing with Autism Spectrum Disorders: Journey from Traditional Methods to Artificial Intelligence.,"World Health Organisation (WHO) in 2024 identified that approximately one in 100 children globally has autism spectrum disorder (ASD). ASD is a collection of neurodevelopmental disorders that impact a person's ability to socially interact and communicate, which can typically be noticed in early childhood. While 'autism' as a term was initially used for schizophrenic patients, later psychiatrists Dr. Kanner and paediatrician Dr. Asperger introduced it as a syndrome in children with behavioural differences in social interaction and communication with restrictive and repetitive interests. In today's time, the umbrella term 'ASDs' is used to describe a clinically heterogeneous group of neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs).
To examine the role of traditional approaches and the potential effectiveness of artificial intelligence (AI) methods in dealing with ASDs for improving the accuracy in its diagnosis and treatment.
The study adopts a narrative review approach to understand the application of AI in ASD. For this purpose, around a hundred research articles were selected from the years 2010-2024. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were identified. The review is organised and grounded on the medical treatment, occupational remedy, vocational remedy, psychology, family remedy and recuperation engineering.
The results show the undisputed role of AI and its ability to identify early indicators of autism, in accordance with the UN Sustainable Development Goal 3 (Good Health and Well-being) and Goal 16 (Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions). Further, healthcare sectors which are using a variety of AI analyses on data sources, genetics, neuroimaging, behavioural patterns and electronic medical records are able to early detect for individualised evaluation of ASD. The significance of timely interventions with the help of machine learning (ML) algorithms demonstrates high accuracy in differentiating ASD from neurotypical development and other developmental disorders.AI-driven therapeutic interventions expand social interactions and communication skills in people with ASD in the form of virtual reality-based training, augmentative communication systems and robot-assisted therapies. Thus, the future of AI in ASD holds promise for improving diagnostic accuracy, implementing telehealth platforms and customising treatment plans, despite obstacles such as data privacy and interpretability.",Annals of neurosciences,2025-09-11,['AnjaliSahai'],10.1177/09727531251369286,asd,asperger syndrome,pubmed
Argyrophilic grain disease: epidemiology and association with cognitive decline and parkinsonism.,"Argyrophilic grain disease is an age-related disorder characterized by the presence of argyrophilic grains. Argyrophilic grain disease has a sequential distribution pattern that begins in the ambient gyrus (Saito Stage I), spreads to the medial temporal lobe (Saito Stage II) and reaches the basal forebrain and cingulate gyrus (Saito Stage III). A strong association with cognitive decline, especially in cases of Saito Stage III argyrophilic grain disease, has also been reported. The main clinical feature includes cognitive decline characterized by memory disturbance, although conflicting results have been reported. Recent studies suggest an association with parkinsonism. To clarify the association between argyrophilic grain disease, cognitive decline and parkinsonism, we performed a clinicopathological study using the Brain Bank for Aging Research autopsy cohort in Japan. Approximately half (227) of the 452 consecutive autopsy cases had argyrophilic grain disease, and the frequency and stage of argyrophilic grain disease increased with age. Among the argyrophilic grain disease cases, 20 were demented without any comorbid pathology responsible for it, a condition referred to as dementia with grains. Furthermore, 6 of the 20 dementia with grains cases presented with parkinsonism, particularly postural instability, in addition to memory disturbance. Dementia with grains cases with parkinsonism had significantly more argyrophilic grains in the substantia nigra than those without parkinsonism and showed significantly decreased anti-dopamine transporter immunoreactivity in the putamen compared to control cases. Given these findings, argyrophilic grain disease is strongly associated with cognitive decline, especially in Saito Stage III cases, and parkinsonism is a new common clinical presentation. The extension of argyrophilic grain disease pathology to the nigrostriatal system may contribute to the development of parkinsonism.",Brain communications,2025-10-15,"['AkiraArakawa', 'TomoyasuMatsubara', 'AyakoShioya', 'ManatoHara', 'YukoHiroyoshi', 'MasanoriKurihara', 'SatoruMorimoto', 'TakayukiKato', 'ManaHigashihara', 'RenpeiSengoku', 'MasashiKameyama', 'KazutomiKanemaru', 'Aya MTokumaru', 'TomioArai', 'NorikazuHara', 'AkinoriMiyashita', 'TakeshiIkeuchi', 'AiriTarutani', 'MasatoHasegawa', 'AtsushiIwata', 'TatsushiToda', 'ShigeoMurayama', 'YukoSaito']",10.1093/braincomms/fcaf352,neurochemistry,dopamine neurodevelopmental,pubmed

Dopamine in Tourette syndrome: a 30-year bibliometric analysis of hotspot evolution.,"Tourette syndrome (TS), a neurodevelopmental disorder, requires attention to the physical and psychological impacts of tics and associated comorbidities. Researchers are making efforts to clarify the pathophysiology of TS and develop effective treatments amidst its rising global prevalence. This study aimed to retrieve publications discussing TS in the context of the dopaminergic system from 1994 to 2023, summarize previous research, and analyze the general information and hotspots to provide references for future research and clinical applications.
Literature was filtered from the Web of Science Core Collection. Excel, CiteSpace, VOSviewer, and Scimago Graphica were used to analyze and visualize the results.
A total of 482 related publications were included in the study. The United States has consistently led in research output, and Yale University demonstrates excellence in workload, impact, and collaboration. Harvey S. Singer has the highest number of publications. The hotspots include comorbidities, dopaminergic Components, candidate genes, and deep brain stimulation.
The analysis reveals that the understanding of TS is gradually evolving towards neuronal and genetic mechanisms. Concurrently, deep brain stimulation is being investigated as a treatment for refractory TS. These findings suggest a need for more in-depth research to produce higher-level evidence.",Frontiers in neurology,2025-10-03,"['QianLiu', 'ZhiyaoZhu', 'FeiLuo', 'YaliDing', 'YuanyuanWang', 'ChangjiangZhao', 'BinYuan']",10.3389/fneur.2025.1589842,neurochemistry,dopamine neurodevelopmental,pubmed
Effects and mechanisms of vitamins A and D on behavior associated with Tourette syndrome in rats.,"Tourette syndrome (TS) is a complex neurodevelopmental disorder involving genetic, neurotransmission, immune, and gut-brain axis mechanisms that cause persistent motor and vocal tics. Current treatments mainly include drugs (for example, neuroleptics), but the treatment strategies are often unsatisfactory. Retinoic acid, derived from vitamin A, plays a role in TS, as children with this condition often exhibit reduced serum levels of retinoic acid and 25-hydroxyvitamin D. Supplementing with either nutrient has been shown to alleviate tic severity and frequency. In this study, we aim to explore the therapeutic effects and possible mechanisms of vitamins A and D in TS.
3,3-Iminodipropionitrile (IDPN) was used to induce acute TS-like symptoms in rats via striatal dopamine dysregulation. Then vitamins A (3 mg/kg/d) and D (10ug/kg/d) were continuously administered by gavage for 8 weeks. Stereotyped and head twitching behavior tests were then performed. High-performance liquid chromatography was used to determine serum levels of 25-OH-D3, calcium, phosphorus, and alkaline phosphatase in rats. The composition of intestinal flora was analyzed using 16S rRNA gene sequencing, and striatum metabolites were detected by untargeted metabolomics.
The experimental results showed that the tic phenotype of TS rats was significantly relieved after 8 weeks of vitamin A and D treatment (
This study shows that vitamin A and D supplementation can significantly alleviate the tic phenotype of TS rats, which demonstrates an association between vitamin A/D-induced gut flora alterations and neurotransmitter changes.

From Pharmacological Treatment to Neuromodulation: A Comprehensive Approach to Managing Gilles de la Tourette Syndrome.,"Gilles de la Tourette syndrome (GTS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by motor and phonic tics, often including attention deficit, hyperactivity, and obsessive-compulsive behaviours. The pathophysiology involves the dysfunction of cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical circuits, primarily implicating dopaminergic hyperactivity, but also involving multiple different neurotransmitter systems. Treatment of GTS is complex, highly individualized, and influenced by considerable variability in symptom presentation. Behavioural approaches, such as Habit Reversal Therapy (HRT), play a key role, especially in milder cases. Pharmacological therapy is largely empirical and varies across countries, influenced by drug availability and the perceived risks of certain classes of drugs, particularly dopamine receptor blocking agents. Drug options for managing tics include dopamine receptor antagonists, monoamine depleting agents, and alpha-2 agonists, all of which require close monitoring for metabolic, cardiovascular, and neurological side effects. Botulinum toxin injections represent an effective solution for focal tics that are resistant to systemic treatments. Cannabinoids and antiepileptics have limited efficacy, yet they may still offer relevant therapeutic potential in selected cases. Serotonergic drugs are useful for treating obsessive-compulsive symptoms. For patients with refractory tics, deep brain stimulation (DBS) represents an intervention of last-resort; however, DBS remains off-label and consensus on optimal targets is lacking. This narrative review draws on both the relevant literature and extensive personal clinical experience to explore the complexities of managing GTS, with a focus on evidence-based treatments for tics and associated neuropsychiatric symptoms. A therapeutic algorithm is proposed, emphasizing a ""start low, go slow"" approach, combining pharmacological interventions with cognitive behavioural and surgical therapies, when needed. We underscore the importance of tailoring treatments to individual patient profiles and symptom variability over time, highlighting the need for further research in GTS management.",International journal of molecular sciences,2025-09-27,"['EdoardoMonfrini', 'ChristianSaleh', 'DomenicoServello', 'PhillipJaszczuk', 'MauroPorta']",10.3390/ijms26188831,neurochemistry,dopamine neurodevelopmental,pubmed
Gut Microbiota and Neurodevelopment in Preterm Infants: Mechanistic Insights and Prospects for Clinical Translation.,"Preterm birth remains a significant global health challenge and is strongly associated with heightened risks of long-term neurodevelopmental impairments, including cognitive delays, behavioural disorders, and emotional dysregulation. In recent years, accumulating evidence has underscored the critical role of the gut microbiota in early brain development through the gut-brain axis. In preterm infants, microbial colonisation is frequently delayed or disrupted due to caesarean delivery, perinatal antibiotic exposure, formula feeding, and prolonged stays in neonatal intensive care units (NICUs), all of which contribute to gut dysbiosis during critical periods of neurodevelopment. This review synthesises current knowledge on the sources, temporal patterns, and determinants of gut microbiota colonisation in preterm infants. This review focuses on the gut bacteriome and uses faecal-sample bacteriome sequencing as its primary method of characterisation. We detail five mechanistic pathways that link microbial disturbances to adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes: immune activation and white matter injury, short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs)-mediated neuroprotection, tryptophan-serotonin metabolic signalling, hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis modulation, and the integrity of intestinal and blood-brain barriers (BBB). We also critically examine emerging microbiota-targeted interventions-including probiotics, prebiotics, human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs), antibiotic stewardship strategies, skin-to-skin contact (SSC), and faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT)-focusing on their mechanisms of action, translational potential, and associated ethical concerns. Finally, we identify key research gaps, including the scarcity of longitudinal studies, limited functional modelling, and the absence of standardised protocols across clinical settings. A comprehensive understanding of microbial-neurodevelopmental interactions may provide a foundation for the development of targeted, timing-sensitive, and ethically sound interventions aimed at improving neurodevelopmental outcomes in this vulnerable population.",Microorganisms,2025-09-27,"['KunDai', 'LingliDing', 'XiaomengYang', 'SuqingWang', 'ZhihuiRong']",10.3390/microorganisms13092213,neurochemistry,serotonin neurodevelopmental,pubmed
Gut Microbiota in Psychiatric and Neurological Disorders: Current Insights and Therapeutic Implications.,"Recent studies increasingly highlight the complex interaction between gut microbiota and mental health, drawing attention to the role of the microbiota-gut-brain axis (MGBA) in the pathophysiology of mental and neurodevelopmental disorders. Changes in the composition of the gut microbiota-dysbiosis-are associated with conditions such as depression, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder (BD), autism spectrum disorders (ASD), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's. These microbial imbalances can affect brain function through a variety of mechanisms, including activation of the immune system, alteration of intestinal permeability, modulation of the digestive and central nervous systems, and changes in the production of neuroactive metabolites such as short-chain fatty acids, serotonin, and tryptophan derivatives. The aim of this paper is to review the current state of knowledge on therapeutic strategies targeting the gut microbiome-including probiotics, prebiotics, synbiotics, personalized dietary interventions, and fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT)-which are becoming promising adjuncts or alternatives to conventional psychopharmacology, offering a forward-looking and individualized approach to mental health treatment.

Short-term effects of sertraline against depressive-like behaviors in a rat model of neonatal hypoxic encephalopathy.,"Hypoxic encephalopathy of the newborn is associated with long-term neurodevelopmental behavioral deficits that lack a definitive ""optimal"" treatment approach. We previously demonstrated that periadolescent depressive-like behaviors occur in a rat model of early-life hypoxia. Here, we investigated the short-term effects of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, sertraline, against later-life behavioral deficits. Rats were exposed to global hypoxia at postnatal day 10 (P10) and then received either sertraline or its vehicle (P24 to P30). Normoxic controls received sertraline or its vehicle. Depressive-like and anxiety-like behaviors were assessed using the forced swim test (FST) and open field test (OFT), respectively. The FST was conducted at P25-26 and the OFT at P27. Rats were sacrificed at P30 to assess hippocampal microRNA (miR) expression and to histologically evaluate hippocampal neuronal densities and synaptophysin (Syp) protein levels. Early-life hypoxic seizures resulted in increased immobility in the FST (p < 0.05) and decreased exploration in the OFT (p < 0.05). Hypoxia also resulted in chronic alterations in the expression of 25 miRs, 22 of which are known to modulate inflammatory responses and synaptic function. Sertraline treatment normalized hypoxia-induced increased immobility and reversed 17 out of 25 alterations in miR expression. However, sertraline potentiated hypoxia-induced exploratory deficits (p < 0.05). The drug treatment also resulted in OFT deficits in controls (p < 0.05) and 13 unique dysregulations in miR expression. Neuronal densities and Syp levels were comparable among all groups. We demonstrate that sertraline reverses hypoxia-induced depressive-like behaviors, possibly by targeting inflammation and synaptic remodeling. Sertraline-induced anxiety-like behaviors may reflect its known transient early side effects and warrant further research on long-term outcomes.",Neuroscience letters,2025-09-27,"['Marie-MichèleSerghani', 'SondosKassem-Moussa', 'RawanMakki', 'AbdallahKurdi', 'MarawanElbaset', 'HeleneHajjar', 'Reem ElJammal', 'Gabriel TFlath-Everhard', 'IshaanPrasad', 'AssaadEid', 'AidaHabib', 'EvaHamade', 'Fletcher AWhite', 'BassamBadran', 'MakramObeid']",10.1016/j.neulet.2025.138392,neurochemistry,serotonin neurodevelopmental,pubmed
The antidepressant venlafaxine induces upregulation of miR-92 and histological alterations in a chicken embryo model.,"Antidepressants are commonly prescribed for treating anxiety disorders and depression, including pregnant patients. These medications influence the absorption and metabolism of key neurotransmitters such as serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine. However, many aspects of antidepressant function remain unclear, especially regarding their impact on neurodevelopment when used during pregnancy. To explore this, we employed a 3R-friendly chicken embryo model to investigate the cellular and molecular implications of antidepressants use. We focused on commonly used antidepressants for the study: escitalopram, which is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor; and venlafaxine, a serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor, both of which are frequently prescribed during pregnancy. Drug distribution analysis showed that both antidepressant drugs reached clinical concentrations in the brain of developing chicken embryos and persisted for several hours. High-throughput miRNA-sequencing showed that venlafaxine upregulated 13 different miRNAs in the chicken cerebellum. Specifically, miR-92 and its human ortholog, miR-363, were significantly upregulated in chicken cerebellum and neuronally differentiated human SH-SY5Y cells, respectively. Neurite metrics showed a significant reduction in neurite outgrowth with venlafaxine, but not with escitalopram. Furthermore, venlafaxine caused histological alterations, such as increased white matter and reduced thickness of the cortical and molecular layer in the cerebellum. Both drugs reduced the thickness of the external granular layer and the number of mitotic events, impacting this crucial germinal zone of the brain. These findings highlight distinct neurodevelopmental effects of escitalopram and venlafaxine and raise awareness for potential adverse neurological effects in offspring exposed to antidepressants in utero.",Neurochemistry international,2025-09-23,"['OykumKaplan-Arabaci', 'DenisZosen', 'DianaDomanska', 'SigridBjørnstad', 'SimoneSantini', 'UmutKaraca', 'Jasmin AndreaHaeckel', 'KristineDolva', 'ZuzanaDančišinová', 'FredHaugen', 'Jannike MørchAndersen', 'Ragnhild ElisabethPaulsen']",10.1016/j.neuint.2025.106056,neurochemistry,serotonin neurodevelopmental,pubmed

Valproate-Induced Autism and Sexual Hormone Disturbances: A Literature Review and Hypotheses.,"Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are neurodevelopmental disorders whose aetiology remains obscure. Multiple human and animal studies have shown that prenatal exposure to valproate increases the risk of ASD in children. Although the mechanisms implicated are still poorly understood, several hypotheses have been put forward; one being that the alteration of the prenatal hormonal milieu could be involved. Indeed, hormone disruption was observed in women with epilepsy or bipolar disorder treated with valproate with an increased risk of experiencing hyperandrogenism or an androgen-associated pathology such as polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) or diabetes. This could be explained by an inhibition of aromatase, the enzyme responsible for the aromatisation of androgens into oestrogens. Hormone disruption could impair neurodevelopment through the involvement of the orphan retinoic acid receptor alpha (RORA), a nuclear receptor whose expression is regulated by dihydrotestosterone (DHT) as well as estradiol, and whose transcriptional targets are implicated in ASD. Moreover, neuroestradiol is a key regulator of neurodevelopment and the effects of its disruption seem to overlap with the consequences of prenatal exposition to valproate. Finally, the onset of autism seems to be more frequent when pregnancies were affected by conditions hormonal disturbances such as obesity, diabetes, pre eclampsia or prematurity. This provides a better understanding of valproate-induced autism patterns and opens up new avenues of research to better understand the development of this disorder.",Neurochemical research,2025-10-16,"['GuillaumeNicolet', 'NicolaMarchi', 'JuliePerroy', 'HugoPeyre', 'AmariaBaghdadli', 'Marie-ChristinePicot']",10.1007/s11064-025-04582-w,neurochemistry,neurotransmitter neurodevelopmental,pubmed
Pregnancy and Caffeine Metabolism: Updated Insights and Implications for Maternal-Fetal Health.,"Caffeine is one of the most widely consumed psychoactive substances globally and is a common component of daily diets, particularly among women of reproductive age. Numerous in vitro and in vivo studies have indicated potential adverse effects of prenatal caffeine exposure, including disturbances in fetal growth, metabolic dysregulation, organ malformations, and neurodevelopmental alterations. These findings suggest that caffeine may influence multiple physiological pathways during gestation, including epigenetic modifications and metabolic programming. However, evidence from human studies remains heterogeneous and often inconclusive. Recent cohort studies and meta-analyses have reported that moderate maternal caffeine intake is not significantly associated with increased risks of gestational diabetes mellitus, gestational hypertension, or preeclampsia, although higher intake levels have been linked to anemia, preterm birth, and low birth weight in some populations. Furthermore, emerging data suggest potential associations between prenatal caffeine exposure and early neurodevelopmental outcomes, including behavioral changes, subtle structural brain differences, and alterations in offspring metabolic health and obesity risk. Despite these findings, the magnitude and clinical relevance of these effects remain uncertain, partly due to variability in caffeine sources, dosages, study designs, and reliance on self-reported intake. This review aims to synthesize current evidence on maternal caffeine consumption, its impact on pregnancy complications, fetal development, and long-term child health outcomes. By integrating experimental and clinical data, the study provides a comprehensive overview that may assist clinicians and healthcare professionals in counseling pregnant women regarding caffeine intake and potential risks.",Nutrients,2025-10-16,"['Katarzyna MariaStruniewicz', 'Magdalena MariaPtaszek', 'Alicja MariannaZiółkowska', 'AnetaNitsch-Osuch', 'AleksandraKozłowska']",10.3390/nu17193173,neurochemistry,neurotransmitter neurodevelopmental,pubmed
"The Etiological Role of Impaired Neurogenesis in Schizophrenia: Interactions with Inflammatory, Microbiome and Hormonal Signaling.","Schizophrenia is a prevailing yet severely debilitating psychiatric disorder characterized by a convoluted etiology. Although antipsychotics have been available for over half a century, they primarily mitigate symptoms rather than providing definitive care. This limitation suggests that the neurotransmitter systems targeted by these medications are not the root cause of the disorder. Ongoing research seeks to elucidate the cellular, molecular, and circuitry pathways that contribute to the development of schizophrenia. Unfortunately, its precise pathogenesis remains incompletely understood. Accumulating evidence implicates dysregulated neurogenesis and aberrant neurodevelopmental processes as key contributors to disease progression. Recent advances in proteomics and imaging technology have facilitated the emergence of novel models of schizophrenia, emphasizing the roles of neuroinflammation, sex steroids, and cortisol. This paper aims to organize and map the intercorrelations and potential causal effects between various mechanistic models to gain deeper insight on how these mechanisms contribute to the cause, risks, and symptoms of the disorder. Furthermore, we discuss the potential therapeutic strategies that target these pathological pathways.

The Role of GABA Pathway Components in Pathogenesis of Neurodevelopmental Disorders.,"γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), the primary inhibitory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system (CNS), regulates neuronal excitability, synaptic plasticity, and oscillatory activity essential for cognition, emotion, and behavior. Disruptions in GABAergic signaling are increasingly recognized as key contributors to a range of neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs), including schizophrenia (SZ), autism spectrum disorder (ASD), major depressive disorder (MDD), bipolar disorder (BD), and intellectual disability (ID). In this review, we analyze the data available from the literature concerning the components of the GABA pathway. We describe the main steps of GABA metabolism, including GABA synthesis and release, GABA receptors neurotransmission, GABA reuptake and catabolism, and evaluate their involvement in the pathogenesis of neurodevelopmental disorders. We suggest the possibility of existence of so far undescribed mechanisms which maintain the concentrations of GABA at a relatively physiological level when the function of glutamic acid decarboxylases is compromised by mutations. Searching for these mechanisms could be important for better understanding neurodevelopment and could give a clue for future searches for new therapeutic approaches for treating or alleviating the symptoms of BD and SZ. We also argue that the metabolic stage of the GABA pathway has only a minor direct effect on GABA signaling and rather causes clinical effects due to accumulation of neurotoxic byproducts.",International journal of molecular sciences,2025-10-16,"['Ekaterina VMarilovtseva', 'AmalAbdurazakov', 'Artemiy OKurishev', 'Vera AMikhailova', 'Vera EGolimbet']",10.3390/ijms26199492,neurochemistry,neurotransmitter neurodevelopmental,pubmed
Association between total hydrocortisone dose and neurodevelopmental outcome at 3 years old in newborns under 28 weeks of gestation.,"Ventilated very-low-birth-weight infants (VLBWIs) frequently receive hydrocortisone (HDC). The HDC dose increases in more serious cases, but the association between the actual HDC dose and neurodevelopmental outcomes is unclear.
A total of 274 VLBWIs were divided into four groups according to the total HDC dose: zero (0 mg/kg), low (1-25 mg/kg), moderate (25-75 mg/kg), high (>75 mg/kg). The developmental quotient (DQ) in each group were compared. Using simple and multiple linear regression analyses, we evaluated the presence of a significant relationship between total DQ and total HDC dose in 274 and 153 VLBWIs receiving HDC therapy. In addition, the association between HDC therapy and the total DQ was investigated in 274 VLBWIs.
The total DQ in the zero group was significantly higher than that in the moderate and high groups but equivalent to that in the low group. Despite a significant association between total DQ and total HDC dose in the single linear regression analysis, no significant association was found between total DQ and total HDC dose in 274 VLBWIs (p = 0.07) and 153 VLBWIs receiving HDC (p = 0.18) using a multiple linear regression analysis, after adjusting for the days of artificial ventilation, gestational age, and the onset of late-stage circulatory collapse.

Linear mixed model analysis showed a significant association between higher HC dosage and lower developmental and intelligence quotient (DQ/IQ) scores. This trend persisted at 6 years of age, suggesting a sustained effect of HC on cognitive outcomes. For every 10 mg increase in HC dosage, IQ scores decreased by 2.82 points (95% CI: -3.89 to -1.06, p = 0.001). The interaction term between HC dosage and time was not statistically significant (0.10, 95% CI: -0.18 to 0.37, p = 0.481), suggesting the association of HC dosage on DQ/IQ did not vary substantially throughout the study period.
We found a relationship between total neonatal HC dosage in ELBW infants and DQ/IQ scores over time that persisted at school age. Clinicians should be aware of this potential dose-dependent effect on neurodevelopmental outcomes.
As neonatal dexamethasone administration is known to affect neurodevelopment outcomes, hydrocortisone (HC) is considered an alternative to dexamethasone as a glucocorticoid treatment. In infants with extremely low birth weight (ELBW), a relationship has been noted between total HC dosage and neurodevelopment in early childhood. We confirmed the association between total HC dosage in infants with ELBW and poor developmental and intelligence quotients to school age. Although HC is commonly used in the management of ELBW infants, clinicians should be aware of its potential dose-dependent effects on neurodevelopmental outcomes.",Pediatric research,2025-09-24,"['AkinobuTaniguchi', 'BasileChrétien', 'TakashiMaeda', 'KazutoUeda', 'RyosukeMiura', 'RyuichiTanaka', 'ToshihikoSuzuki', 'YukakoMuramatsu', 'ErinaKataoka', 'EikoKato', 'HikaruYamamoto', 'KojiTakemoto', 'MiharuIto', 'SeijiHayashi', 'YuichiroSugiyama', 'KazukiNishida', 'YoshiakiSato']",10.1038/s41390-025-04426-x,hormones,cortisol neurodevelopmental,pubmed
Neurodevelopmental outcome in infants with neonatal encephalopathy receiving hydrocortisone during therapeutic hypothermia: follow-up of the extended-CORTISoL trial.,"To investigate neurodevelopmental outcome after hydrocortisone (HC) supplementation in infants with neonatal encephalopathy (NE) and hypotension.
Fifty-five infants with volume-resistant hypotension during hypothermia were enrolled between 2016 and 2020. Eligible patients were randomly assigned to receive 0.5 mg/kg HC every 6 h or placebo along with standard dopamine treatment. Composite adverse outcome was defined as death or neurodevelopmental impairment, ascertained using the Bayley-II test.
At median 20 months of age, death, or severe neurodevelopmental impairment occurred in 40% in the HC group, compared to 18% in the placebo group (p = 0.13). Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that for every 1 mg/kg increase in cumulative HC dose, the odds of adverse cognitive outcome increased by 16% (95% CI 1.01-1.37; p = 0.04).
The composite outcomes were similar in the HC-treated and placebo groups, however cumulative HC dose was associated with adverse cognitive outcome in infants with NE and hypotension.

Use of hydrocortisone in extremely preterm infants: emphasis on those born least mature.,"The steroid hormone cortisol plays crucial roles in innate stress response, downregulation of inflammation, and promotion of glucose homeostasis. Infants born extremely preterm may be prone to cardiovascular compromise and inflammation-mediated respiratory disease due in part to insufficient cortisol production. Current data show that hydrocortisone, the exogenous medication form of cortisol, may help prevent or treat complications associated with relative adrenal insufficiency, although the full balance of treatment risks and benefits is uncertain. Prophylactic administration of hydrocortisone beginning in the first 1-2 postnatal days in extremely preterm infants likely results in earlier initial weaning from invasive ventilation and may reduce in-hospital mortality and the composite outcome of death or bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). However, such use may increase the risk of sepsis in infants born less than 26 weeks' gestation and gastrointestinal perforation with concurrent exposure to indomethacin. Whether prophylactic hydrocortisone affects childhood neurodevelopment has not been adequately studied. Initiation of hydrocortisone after the first postnatal week in infants receiving invasive ventilation promotes successful extubation but does not affect risks of mortality, BPD, or neurodevelopmental impairment. In extremely preterm infants with hypotension, hydrocortisone can increase blood pressure, but short- and long-term safety for this indication and usefulness compared to other anti-hypotensive agents are not well established.",Journal of perinatology : official journal of the California Perinatal Association,2025-09-21,"['Erik AJensen', 'Matthew ARysavy', 'SatoshiKusuda', 'NoneNone']",10.1038/s41372-025-02424-9,hormones,cortisol neurodevelopmental,pubmed

"Tetramethyl Bisphenol F: Organ- and System-Specific Toxicity, Current Status, and Perspectives.","Tetramethyl bisphenol F (TMBPF) is being increasingly used as a Bisphenol A (BPA) substitute, particularly as a coating material for food and beverage cans. Unlike BPA, TMBPF is considered safe because of the lack of reported estrogenic effects, and it is often marketed under the ""BPA-free"" label. Initial cell-based assays and rat toxicity studies indicated much lower systemic and sex hormone-related toxicity of TMBPF compared with BPA, which has facilitated its substitution and significant market expansion. Since 2021, however, a growing body of research has reported various adverse effects of TMBPF across multiple biological systems. These include cytotoxicity associated with apoptosis and endocrine-disrupting effects on the thyroid axis, skeletal system, neurodevelopment, and reproductive function. Although the effects on the estrogen and androgen systems, as well as obesogenic potential, show variability across studies, several studies have indicated significant biological impacts. Of particular concern is the potential neurodevelopmental toxicity, which may manifest only after long-term exposure and is often irreversible. Even if current leaching levels from food contact materials are minimal, environmental accumulation and biomagnification over time may pose significant risks. Therefore, comprehensive toxicological profiling of TMBPF is essential. This review summarizes the current toxicological findings on TMBPF and discusses the implications for future research and regulatory considerations, highlighting the importance of early attention to potential public health impacts.

The role of the Wnt/BDNF pathway in maternal SCH-induced autism-like phenotypes in offspring rats: behavioral and molecular mechanisms.,"Maternal subclinical hypothyroidism (SCH) has been associated with neurodevelopmental disorders, but the molecular mechanisms underlying its impact on offspring behavior remain poorly understood. This study investigates the role of the Wnt/BDNF signaling pathway in the development of autism-like behaviors in male offspring rats born to SCH mothers. Our findings demonstrate that maternal SCH induces significant behavioral abnormalities in the offspring, including increased grooming behavior and deficits in social interaction, which are hallmarks of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). These behaviors correlate with alterations in hippocampal protein expression, particularly a decrease in Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) and key signaling molecules involved in neuronal survival, such as cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) and B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2). Additionally, we observe a marked upregulation of mTOR gene expression and a downregulation of Wnt signaling in the hippocampus of SCH-exposed offspring. These molecular changes are consistent with disrupted synaptic plasticity and neurogenesis, which are critical processes for cognitive and social development. Our study further reveals that impaired Wnt/BDNF signaling may play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of autism-like behaviors in these offspring. Moreover, sex-specific differences were observed in the behavioral manifestations, with male offspring showing more pronounced deficits, suggesting a gender-dependent sensitivity to maternal SCH. This research provides novel insights into the molecular pathways by which maternal thyroid dysfunction contributes to neurodevelopmental disorders, offering potential targets for therapeutic intervention.",Translational psychiatry,2025-10-08,"['DijieLiu', 'KaiTao', 'YingSun', 'JialinHao', 'ShiyongWang']",10.1038/s41398-025-03570-6,hormones,thyroid neurodevelopmental,pubmed
Neurodevelopmental Impact of Prenatal Stress: A Proteomic Analysis of Myelination Disruptions in the Avian Embryo.,"Prenatal stress, mediated by elevated glucocorticoid (GC) levels, is a relevant modulator of fetal brain development and a known risk factor for neurodevelopmental disorders. Using the avian embryo as a vertebrate model, we injected corticosterone into the yolk on embryonic day 6 (E6) and assessed neurodevelopmental outcomes at day 14 (E14). Through deep proteomic profiling - quantifying over 6500 proteins - we uncovered a robust molecular signature of stress-induced disruption. Key myelin-associated proteins (myelin basic protein [MBP], PLP1, 2',3'-cyclic-nucleotide 3'-phosphodiesterase [CNP]) were markedly downregulated, indicating impaired oligodendrocyte maturation. These proteomic shifts were corroborated by immunohistochemistry and qPCR. Pathway-level analysis pointed to altered MAPK and AKT signaling as putative mediators of the observed phenotype. Our findings mirror previous mammalian data while highlighting the avian model's unique suitability for mechanistic dissection of prenatal stress effects.

Inflammatory mechanisms contribute to long-term cognitive deficits induced by perinatal asphyxia via interleukin-1.,"Perinatal asphyxia remains a leading cause of neonatal mortality and a major contributor to permanent neurological deficits. Even mild cases can result in long-term neurodevelopmental, cognitive, behavioural and psychiatric disorders. However, the mechanisms underlying asphyxia-induced hypoxic-ischaemic brain injury remain poorly understood, limiting the development of targeted interventions during the critical early plastic period. To explore the behavioural and molecular outcomes of perinatal asphyxia that may model important aspects of neuropsychiatric disorders observed in humans, we utilised a translationally relevant, non-invasive oxygen deprivation model of asphyxia in postnatal day 7 rats. We conducted a comprehensive assessment of asphyxia-induced changes, integrating neurobehavioural profiling (evaluating cognitive, emotional, social and neuromotor functions), microglial morphology analysis, neuroimaging, stress hormone measurement and whole-transcriptome sequencing techniques to elucidate the acute and long-term functional consequences. Consistent with clinical observations, the extensive functional assessment revealed distinct sex-dependent effects, including increased anxiety and impulsivity, attention deficits and impaired inhibitory control, which were observed exclusively in males, with no apparent sensorimotor deficits. This phenotype resembling attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in adult rats was associated with a lasting increase in inhibitory bouton densities in the medial prefrontal cortex. The development of an acute inflammatory response after perinatal asphyxia marked by phenotypic transformation of microglia, paralleled brain perfusion and stress hormone changes. Notably, microglial changes were mitigated by the blockade of proinflammatory interleukin-1 signalling via systemic IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1RA) administration in a therapeutically relevant time window. Importantly, early blockade of proinflammatory responses was able to prevent cognitive deficits in adulthood and normalise inhibitory bouton densities. RNA sequencing analysis revealed asphyxia-induced dysregulation of molecular pathways targeting GABAergic signalling, potentially contributing to subsequent morphological and neuropsychiatric alterations. IL-1RA treatment appeared to engage distinct epigenetic regulatory mechanisms, rather than merely reversing these disruptions in the acute post-asphyxia period. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that perinatal asphyxia induces marked behavioural deficits in attention and inhibitory control, paralleled by lasting inhibitory and epigenetic dysregulation, preceded by acute induction of microglia-driven inflammatory processes in the medial prefrontal cortex. Systemic IL-1RA administration may represent a promising therapeutic opportunity to prevent long-term cognitive impairments caused by perinatal asphyxia.",Neuropsychopharmacology : official publication of the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology,2025-10-03,"['HangaKelemen', 'Gyula YBalla', 'KornélDemeter', 'EszterSipos', 'AndrásBuzás-Kaizler', 'LászlóBiró', 'ManóAliczki', 'BarbaraOrsolits', 'ÁronKerényi', 'ZoltánBalogh', 'BenedekPászthy-Szabó', 'DiánaPejtsik', 'LajosHegyi', 'KrisztiánSzigeti', 'DomokosMáthé', 'ParasuramanPadmanabhan', 'CsabaBödör', 'AndreaFekete', 'MiklósSzabó', 'KaiKaila', 'ÁdámDénes', 'ÉvaMikics']",10.1038/s41386-025-02227-8,hormones,stress hormone neurodevelopmental,pubmed
Neonatal sevoflurane exposure enhances stress-related neurological susceptibility via NKCC1 modulation.,"Neonatal exposure to sevoflurane has been associated with neurodevelopmental impairments. However, the mechanisms underlying increased susceptibility to stress-related neurological disorders remain unclear. This study aimed to investigate the brain vulnerability after repeated neonatal sevoflurane exposure in rats to future traumatic stress exposure.P5 male Sprague - Dawley rats were exposed to 3% sevoflurane for 2 h daily from P6 to P8. Bumetanide, an NKCC1 inhibitor, was administered intraperitoneally before sevoflurane exposure. The expression of NKCC1 in the hippocampus at P8 was detected by reverse transcription -polymerase chain reaction and Western blot analysis. The brain vulnerability to stress exposure was assessed at P14-20 by conditioned fear traumatic stress model. The stress response was assessed by measuring serum corticosterone level. Primary hippocampal neurons of neonatal rat were cultured in vitro and exposed to sevoflurane with or without bumetanide pretreatment. The growth activity, intracellular LDH enzyme activity, ROS levels and apoptosis of hippocampal neurons were determined. Repeated neonatal sevoflurane exposure in rats enhanced serum corticosterone secretion after fear conditioning training and induced deficits in fear extinction training and recall.Pretreatment with bumetanide reversed these effects. In cultured primary neonatal rat hippocampal neurons, sevoflurane exposure enhanced the expression of NKCC1, increased the markers of neuronal cytotoxicity and downregulated the expression of Noggin, Drebrin and MAP2. In contrast, pretreatment with NKCC1 inhibitor bumetanide attenuated these adverse effects in vitro. Our results suggest repeated neonatal sevoflurane exposure enhances stress-related neurological susceptibility in rats by upregulating NKCC1, highlighting NKCC1 as a potential therapeutic target for anesthesia-induced neurodevelopmental vulnerability.",Scientific reports,2025-09-27,"['Bi-YingYuan', 'Li-HuiShan', 'JiangZou', 'Xiao-HaiXie', 'Jia-QiGan', 'Ben-ZhenChen']",10.1038/s41598-025-18584-9,hormones,stress hormone neurodevelopmental,pubmed
Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis dysfunction in children with ADHD: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common neurodevelopmental disorder in children, characterized by persistent inattention, hyperactivity and impulsivity. Dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis has been proposed as one neurobiological mechanism, yet findings across individual studies are inconsistent.
To quantify differences in HPA-axis function between children under 18 years with ADHD and typically developing (TD) controls across multiple biological markers. TD children were defined as having no diagnosis of ADHD or any other psychiatric or neurodevelopmental disorder.
A systematic review and random-effects meta-analysis of studies published from 1999 to 2025 was performed following PRISMA guidelines. Searches of PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, SpringerLink, CNKI, Wanfang, VIP and CBM identified studies reporting adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), basal cortisol (saliva or blood), cortisol awakening response (CAR), stress-reactive cortisol or hair cortisol concentration (HCC). Pooled effect sizes were expressed as standardized mean differences (SMDs) with 95 % confidence intervals (CIs). Heterogeneity was assessed with the I² statistic; publication bias was examined using funnel plots and Egger's test.
Thirty-four studies (n = 4635; 2559 ADHD, 2076 TD) met inclusion criteria. Compared with TD controls, children with ADHD had significantly lower morning awakening cortisol (SMD = -0.63, 95 % CI -0.93 to -0.34), 30-min post-awakening cortisol (SMD = -0.39, 95 % CI -0.54 to -0.23), afternoon cortisol (SMD = -0.85, 95 % CI -1.63 to -0.06) and post-test cortisol (SMD = -2.14, 95 % CI -3.93 to -0.34). No group differences emerged for ACTH, CAR, pre-test cortisol or HCC. Subgroup analyses showed larger effects in blood versus saliva matrices and in studies from China; the hypocortisolemic profile was most pronounced in the hyperactive-impulsive (ADHD-HI) subtype. Meta-regression identified no significant moderators, and no evidence of publication bias was detected.
ADHD may exhibit a consistent pattern of HPA-axis hypoactivity, affecting both basal secretion and stress responsiveness, whereas ACTH, CAR and HCC appear preserved. The effect is strongest in the ADHD-HI subtype and when cortisol is measured in blood, indicating a subtype-specific and matrix-dependent neuroendocrine phenotype. These findings may support HPA-axis dysregulation as a potential biological correlate of ADHD.",Psychoneuroendocrinology,2025-09-21,"['LiFulun', 'LiYanan', 'GuBing', 'LiQian', 'LiAishu', 'LiuXia', 'WeiQian', 'ZhaoQianlong']",10.1016/j.psyneuen.2025.107605,hormones,stress hormone neurodevelopmental,pubmed
Facial Tic Detection in Untrimmed Videos of Tourette Syndrome Patients,"Tourette Syndrome (TS) is a behavior disorder that onsets in childhood and is
characterized by the expression of involuntary movements and sounds commonly

therapists and the difficulties for in-home follow up work limits its
effectiveness. An automatic tic detection system that is easy to deploy could
alleviate the difficulties of home-therapy by providing feedback to the
patients while exercising tic awareness. In this work, we propose a novel
architecture (T-Net) for automatic tic detection and classification from
untrimmed videos. T-Net combines temporal detection and segmentation and
operates on features that are interpretable to a clinician. We compare T-Net to
several state-of-the-art systems working on deep features extracted from the

Analysis of Neural Clusters due to Deep Brain Stimulation Pulses,"Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is an established method for treating
pathological conditions such as Parkinson's disease, dystonia, Tourette
syndrome, and essential tremor. While the precise mechanisms which underly the
effectiveness of DBS are not fully understood, theoretical studies of
populations of neural oscillators stimulated by periodic pulses suggest that
this may be related to clustering, in which subpopulations of the neurons are
synchronized, but the subpopulations are desynchronized with respect to each
other. The details of the clustering behavior depend on the frequency and
amplitude of the stimulation in a complicated way. In the present study, we
investigate how the number of clusters, their stability properties, and their
basins of attraction can be understood in terms of one-dimensional maps defined
on the circle. Moreover, we generalize this analysis to stimuli that consist of
pulses with alternating properties, which provide additional degrees of freedom
in the design of DBS stimuli. Our results illustrate how the complicated
properties of clustering behavior for periodically forced neural oscillator
populations can be understood in terms of a much simpler dynamical system.",,2020-07-05,"Daniel Kuelbs, Jacob Dunefsky, Bharat Monga, Jeff Moehlis",10.48550/arXiv.2007.02414,arxiv_neuroscience,tourette syndrome neurobiology,arxiv

argued on the basis of clear examples herein, a chain of interdependent
negative and potentially long-term metabolic changes. This leads to a
deregulation of the serotonin and dopamine neurotransmitter pathways in the
developing brain, currently associated with online activity abuse or internet
addiction, and akin to that found in severe substance abuse syndromes. A

Exploiting the Brain's Network Structure for Automatic Identification of ADHD Subjects,"Attention Deficit Hyperactive Disorder (ADHD) is a common behavioral problem
affecting children. In this work, we investigate the automatic classification
of ADHD subjects using the resting state Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging
(fMRI) sequences of the brain. We show that the brain can be modeled as a
functional network, and certain properties of the networks differ in ADHD
subjects from control subjects. We compute the pairwise correlation of brain
voxels' activity over the time frame of the experimental protocol which helps
to model the function of a brain as a network. Different network features are
computed for each of the voxels constructing the network. The concatenation of
the network features of all the voxels in a brain serves as the feature vector.
Feature vectors from a set of subjects are then used to train a PCA-LDA
(principal component analysis-linear discriminant analysis) based classifier.
We hypothesized that ADHD-related differences lie in some specific regions of
the brain and using features only from those regions is sufficient to
discriminate ADHD and control subjects. We propose a method to create a brain
mask that includes the useful regions only and demonstrate that using the
feature from the masked regions improves classification accuracy on the test
data set. We train our classifier with 776 subjects and test on 171 subjects
provided by The Neuro Bureau for the ADHD-200 challenge. We demonstrate the
utility of graph-motif features, specifically the maps that represent the
frequency of participation of voxels in network cycles of length 3. The best
classification performance (69.59%) is achieved using 3-cycle map features with
masking. Our proposed approach holds promise in being able to diagnose and

Local Temporal Feature Enhanced Transformer with ROI-rank Based Masking for Diagnosis of ADHD,"In modern society, Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is one of
the common mental diseases discovered not only in children but also in adults.
In this context, we propose a ADHD diagnosis transformer model that can
effectively simultaneously find important brain spatiotemporal biomarkers from
resting-state functional magnetic resonance (rs-fMRI). This model not only
learns spatiotemporal individual features but also learns the correlation with
full attention structures specialized in ADHD diagnosis. In particular, it
focuses on learning local blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signals and
distinguishing important regions of interest (ROI) in the brain. Specifically,
the three proposed methods for ADHD diagnosis transformer are as follows.
First, we design a CNN-based embedding block to obtain more expressive
embedding features in brain region attention. It is reconstructed based on the
previously CNN-based ADHD diagnosis models for the transformer. Next, for
individual spatiotemporal feature attention, we change the attention method to
local temporal attention and ROI-rank based masking. For the temporal features
of fMRI, the local temporal attention enables to learn local BOLD signal
features with only simple window masking. For the spatial feature of fMRI,
ROI-rank based masking can distinguish ROIs with high correlation in ROI
relationships based on attention scores, thereby providing a more specific
biomarker for ADHD diagnosis. The experiment was conducted with various types
of transformer models. To evaluate these models, we collected the data from 939
individuals from all sites provided by the ADHD-200 competition. Through this,
the spatiotemporal enhanced transformer for ADHD diagnosis outperforms the
performance of other different types of transformer variants. (77.78ACC

Finding essential parts of the brain in rs-fMRI can improve diagnosing ADHD by Deep Learning,"Attention Deficit\Hyperactivity Disorder(ADHD) is considered a very common
psychiatric disorder, but it is difficult to establish an accurate diagnostic
method for ADHD. Recently, with the development of computing resources and
machine learning methods, studies have been conducted to classify ADHD using
resting-state functional magnetic resonance(rsfMRI) imaging data. However, most
of them utilized all areas of the brain for training the models. In this study,
as a different way from this approach, we conducted a study to classify ADHD by
selecting areas that are essential for using a deep learning model. For the
experiment, rsfMRI data provided by ADHD 200 global competition was used. To
obtain an integrated result from the multiple sites, each region of the brain
was evaluated with Leave one site out cross-validation. As a result, when we
only used 15 important region of interest(ROIs) for training, an accuracy of
70.6% was obtained, significantly exceeding the existing results of 68.6% from
all ROIs. In addition, to explore the new structure based on SCCNN-RNN, we
performed the same experiment with three modified models: (1) Separate Channel
CNN RNN with Attention (ASCRNN), (2) Separate Channel dilate CNN RNN with
Attention (ASDRNN), (3) Separate Channel CNN slicing RNN with Attention
(ASSRNN). As a result, the ASSRNN model provided a high accuracy of 70.46% when
training with only 13 important region of interest (ROI). These results show
that finding and using the crucial parts of the brain in diagnosing ADHD by
Deep Learning can get better results than using all areas.",,2021-08-14,"Byunggun Kim, Jaeseon Park, Taehun Kim, Younghun Kwon",10.48550/arXiv.2108.10137,arxiv_neuroscience,ADHD brain imaging,arxiv
Auditory Brainstem Response in Infants and Children with Autism: A Meta-Analysis,"Infants with autism were recently found to have prolonged Auditory Brainstem

2016. The 25 studies that were included had a total of 1349 participants (727
participants with autism and 622 controls) and an age range of 0-40 years.
Prolongation of wave V in autism had a significant negative correlation with

Human Gesture and Gait Analysis for Autism Detection,"Autism diagnosis presents a major challenge due to the vast heterogeneity of
the condition and the elusive nature of early detection. Atypical gait and
gesture patterns are dominant behavioral characteristics of autism and can
provide crucial insights for diagnosis. Furthermore, these data can be
collected efficiently in a non-intrusive way, facilitating early intervention
to optimize positive outcomes. Existing research mainly focuses on associating
facial and eye-gaze features with autism. However, very few studies have
investigated movement and gesture patterns which can reveal subtle variations
and characteristics that are specific to autism. To address this gap, we
present an analysis of gesture and gait activity in videos to identify children
with autism and quantify the severity of their condition by regressing autism
diagnostic observation schedule scores. Our proposed architecture addresses two
key factors: (1) an effective feature representation to manifest irregular
gesture patterns and (2) a two-stream co-learning framework to enable a
comprehensive understanding of its relation to autism from diverse perspectives
without explicitly using additional data modality. Experimental results
demonstrate the efficacy of utilizing gesture and gait-activity videos for
autism analysis.",,2023-04-17,"Sania Zahan, Zulqarnain Gilani, Ghulam Mubashar Hassan, Ajmal Mian",10.48550/arXiv.2304.08368,arxiv_neuroscience,autism neurochemistry,arxiv
"Hear Me, See Me, Understand Me: Audio-Visual Autism Behavior Recognition","In this article, we introduce a novel problem of audio-visual autism behavior
recognition, which includes social behavior recognition, an essential aspect
previously omitted in AI-assisted autism screening research. We define the task
at hand as one that is audio-visual autism behavior recognition, which uses
audio and visual cues, including any speech present in the audio, to recognize
autism-related behaviors. To facilitate this new research direction, we
collected an audio-visual autism spectrum dataset (AV-ASD), currently the
largest video dataset for autism screening using a behavioral approach. It
covers an extensive range of autism-associated behaviors, including those
related to social communication and interaction. To pave the way for further
research on this new problem, we intensively explored leveraging foundation
models and multimodal large language models across different modalities. Our
experiments on the AV-ASD dataset demonstrate that integrating audio, visual,
and speech modalities significantly enhances the performance in autism behavior
recognition. Additionally, we explored the use of a post-hoc to ad-hoc pipeline
in a multimodal large language model to investigate its potential to augment
the model's explanatory capability during autism behavior recognition. We will
release our dataset, code, and pre-trained models.",,2024-03-22,"Shijian Deng, Erin E. Kosloski, Siddhi Patel, Zeke A. Barnett, Yiyang Nan, Alexander Kaplan, Sisira Aarukapalli, William T.
