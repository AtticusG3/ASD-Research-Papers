## Technical Implementation

### Scripts Created

1. **`scripts/find_papers_to_scrape.py`**
   - Analyzes CSV to identify unscraped papers
   - Filters out already processed papers
   - Generates list of 20 papers for scraping

2. **`scripts/webscrape_next_20_papers.py`**
   - Initial scraping attempt with DOI resolution
   - Multiple source discovery strategies
   - Content extraction and markdown conversion

3. **`scripts/improved_webscraper.py`**
   - Retry mechanism for failed papers
   - Alternative source discovery (PMC, Google Scholar)
   - Enhanced content detection algorithms

### Source Discovery Strategies

1. **DOI Resolution:** Direct DOI-to-URL resolution
2. **Publisher Detection:** Identification of open access vs paywalled sources
3. **Alternative Sources:** PubMed Central direct access, Google Scholar
4. **Unpaywall API:** Open access version detection

### Content Extraction Methods

1. **Multiple Selectors:** Various HTML selectors for different site structures
2. **Content Validation:** Minimum length requirements and quality checks
3. **Text Cleaning:** Normalization of whitespace and formatting
4. **Metadata Preservation:** YAML frontmatter with complete paper information

## Challenges and Solutions

### Challenges Encountered

1. **Paywall Restrictions:** Many papers behind publisher paywalls
2. **Dynamic Content:** JavaScript-loaded content not accessible
3. **Content Detection:** Varying HTML structures across sites
4. **Rate Limiting:** Need for respectful scraping practices

### Solutions Implemented

1. **Multiple Source Strategies:** Tried various access methods
2. **Alternative Sources:** PMC direct access, Google Scholar
3. **Improved Parsing:** Enhanced content detection algorithms
4. **Respectful Scraping:** Delays between requests, proper headers
