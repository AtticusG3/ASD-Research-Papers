        "abstract": "Cannabis-based medicine (CBM) is recommended for the treatment of tics in otherwise treatment-resistant adult patients with Tourette syndrome (TS). However, evidence in children with TS is very limited. Long-term effects of CBM in this population are unknown.\nWe present two cases of long-term follow-up over six and five years, respectively, in male adolescents with TS who were administered CBM starting at the age of eight and 12 years, respectively. In one patient CBM treatment was initiated with pure tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and was later changed to current treatment with an oral THC-dominant cannabis extract (THC:cannabidiol (CBD)=25:<0.5) with a daily dose of 0.5-0.6 mL (corresponding to 12.5-15 mg THC/day). The other patient was from the beginning up to now medicated by his parents, who are physicians, with vaporized THC-dominant (24%) medicinal cannabis flowers with a dose of 0.2 g between once to thrice per day (corresponding to 48-144 mg THC/day). While in one patient, there was a moderate dose increase over the years, in the other patient dosages were adjusted individually depending on tic severity. In both patients, CBM treatment resulted in continued benefit with significant improvement of tics and psychiatric comorbidities without severe adverse effects. Academic performance of both adolescents was excellent. Neurocognitive assessments demonstrated average results in the domain of working memory and average to above average results in the domain of processing speed.\nWe present two cases of minors with TS who started CBM treatment at the age of eight and 12 years, respectively, and continued treatment for five to six years resulting in clinically relevant symptom improvement without any severe adverse effects or negative impact on cognitive and academic performance.",

        "abstract": "As a prominent complementary and alternative therapy, acupuncture is widely used to treat Tourette syndrome in children. This review aims to evaluate its clinical efficacy and provide evidence-based support for acupuncture in pediatric Tourette syndrome.\nWe systematically searched six databases: China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang Database, VIP Information Chinese Journal Service Platform, PubMed, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Embase, from their inception to 10 April 2025. Randomized controlled trials comparing acupuncture alone versus medication, or acupuncture plus other treatments versus other treatments alone, for children tic disorder were included.\nThirty-two studies were included, with 2,201 participants. Acupuncture may be more effective in improving motor tics symptoms than dopamine agonist [WMD -3.04, 95% CI (-3.77, -2.31), RD 0.38 (0.29, 0.46)], slightly improving vocal tics [WMD -2.39, 95% CI (-3.51, -1.26), RD 0.21 (0.10, 0.35)] and overall condition [WMD -5.56, 95% CI (-7.28, -3.83), RD 0.05 (0.02, 0.09)], but having little difference in functional impairment [WMD -2.27, 95% CI (-3.58, -0.96), RD 0.14 (0.09, 0.20)]. Acupuncture may be more effective than blank treatment on basis of other therapies in improving motor tics [WMD -2.51, 95% CI (-3.54, -1.49), RD 0.31 (0.19, 0.41)] and vocal tics [WMD -2.56, 95% CI (-3.66, -1.45), RD 0.28 (0.15, 0.40)], but slightly improving functional impairment [WMD -2.91, 95% CI (-4.64, -1.19), RD 0.13 (0.05, 0.23)] and overall symptom severity [WMD -5.57, 95% CI (-7.47, -3.68), RD 0.11 (0.06, 0.17)].\nChinese children with Tourette syndrome using acupuncture may experience more improvement in motor tics symptoms than those using dopamine agonist. Acupuncture combined with other therapies may bring Chinese children with Tourette syndrome symptom relief in motor tics and vocal tics more than those alone. All results are supported by low-quality evidence.\nhttps://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO/view/CRD42023444312, identifier CRD42023444312.",

The specific software was used to display relevant nerve fiber bundles on DTI. In total, 7 children with Tourette syndrome were enrolled including 6 boys and 1 girl aged 3 to 10 (5.6\u2005\u00b1\u20052.3) years. The symptoms included paroxysmal shoulder convulsions, facial muscle twitching, involuntary blinking, right hand twitching, epilepsy, involuntary shrug, and attention deficit. On DTI, the morphology and course of the corticospinal tracts were damaged or abnormal, the inferior frontal occipital tracts were damaged or abnormal, the fiber bundles in the compression part of the corpus callosum were reduced in the number and abnormal in the morphology, and the brain nerve fiber bundle connection was reduced. In conclusion, the nerve fiber bundle connection and damage and abnormality of the morphology and course of the corticospinal tract, fiber bundles of the compression part of the corpus callosum, and the inferior frontal occipital tract in children with the Tourette syndrome can be clearly observed on DTI, and the DTI technique can provide valuable imaging support for revealing the neuropathological mechanism of the Tourette syndrome in children.",

        "doi": "10.1088/1741-2552/ae1257",
        "abstract": "Tourette syndrome (TS) is a chronic tic disorder characterized by motor and vocal tics. Neuropsychiatric symptoms are nearly universal in TS, particularly attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). TS can have substantial effects on quality of life, social and intellectual development, opportunities, relationships, and more. Treatment options are limited; the most common being behavioral therapy and pharmacological interventions, such as antipsychotics and anti-adrenergic agents, often yielding unsatisfactory benefits. Neuromodulation, the alteration of neural pathways and networks under external stimulation, has been established as a viable treatment strategy for specific aspects of TS. Several neuromodulation techniques have been utilized, with deep brain stimulation (DBS) exhibiting the strongest efficacy at around 50% reduction of tics on average across cohorts. However, the invasive nature of DBS remains a disincentive for its uptake, as well as the natural reduction in tic severity for many TS individuals as they enter adulthood. Less-invasive neuromodulation has also been explored, but efficacy remains limited. Given its effectiveness in TS, DBS provides the unique opportunity to record neural activity from deep brain structures, which has been used to investigate underlying pathophysiology and search for biomarkers of treatment response. These insights may guide strategies for less invasive neuromodulation. In this narrative review, we aim to discuss currently utilized neuromodulation therapies for the treatment of TS, as well as propose potential future strategies. Additionally, we discuss how to maximize progress in the field, including crucial multicenter data sharing, utilization of recording capabilities on DBS devices, correlation with the precise location of implanted electrodes, and harnessing pre-clinical studies for a more parameterized understanding of TS neuromodulation. These techniques will enable a clearer understanding of TS and the mechanisms behind successful treatment. This could lead to advanced therapies that improve the quality of life for individuals with TS.",

        "doi": "10.5080/u27551",
        "abstract": "Tourette Syndrome (TS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by multiple motor tics and at least one vocal tic. This case report presents a patient who did not respond adequately to pharmacotherapy, highlighting the effects of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) and the outcomes of longitudinal follow-up. The patient is a 25-year-old male with no history of other physical illnesses. His symptoms began 17 years ago with simple motor tics, which gradually progressed to include complex motor and vocal tics. Over time, he also developed irritability and a persistent sense of impending doom. Clinical evaluation led to diagnoses of Tourette Syndrome comorbid with generalized anxiety disorder. Pharmacological treatment included escitalopram (10 mg/day), followed sequentially by pimozide (4 mg/day), tetrabenazine (3*25 mg/day), and aripiprazole (10 mg/day). Pimozide and aripiprazole showed no effect on the tics, and tetrabenazine was discontinued due to intolerable gastrointestinal side effects. Escitalopram, which effectively managed the patient&rsquo;s anxiety, was continued at 10 mg/day. The patient then underwent 40 sessions of rTMS over eight weeks, targeting the bilateral supplementary motor area. Each session consisted of 1 Hz stimulation at 110% of the resting motor threshold, delivering 1200 stimuli per day over 20 minutes, five days a week. Following the treatment, significant improvements were observed: a 75% reduction in the general functionality score and a 59.7% reduction in the total tic severity score. This report suggests that rTMS may be a promising alternative for TS patients with psychiatric comorbidities, particularly those who cannot tolerate medications or achieve sufficient symptom control through pharmacotherapy alone.

        "doi": "10.2196/66912",
        "abstract": "People with tic disorders (TDs)-such as Tourette syndrome-report poorer quality of life compared to non-TD peers, and experience considerable difficulties, including societal stigmatization and barriers to accessing health care and evidence-based interventions. Peer support can help improve psychological outcomes, and online support communities (OSCs) are one way to access psychological support. Empowerment involves improving an individual's cognitive processes to increase their ability to assert control over their health condition. OSCs have been suggested to facilitate empowerment, but this has not yet been investigated in users of OSCs for TDs.\nThis study aimed to explore empowerment processes and outcomes present in OSCs as perceived and reported by users of OSCs for TDs living with a TD.\nA web-based survey of current users of OSCs for TDs (n=39) was conducted in summer 2022. The survey included four free-text questions about the impact of using OSCs for TDs in relation to empowerment, such as how it has affected their interactions with health care professionals (HCPs), decisions about treatment, and their experiences of living with a TD. Survey responses were analyzed using deductive and inductive reflexive thematic analysis guided by an initial coding structure derived from the empowering processes and outcomes theoretical framework.\nAnalysis of responses identified a range of empowering processes (eg, exchanging information, encountering emotional support, finding recognition, and sharing experiences) and outcomes (eg, being better informed, feeling more confident in the relationship with HCPs and in making treatment decisions, and enhanced well-being) as related to OSC use in people with TDs that were consistent with the theoretical framework. Additionally, the process of changing stereotypes and stigma, the outcomes of raising awareness, and \"one size does not fit all\" were identified. A small number of disempowering processes and outcomes were identified, notably the outcome of feeling less confident in the relationship with HCPs.\nThese findings contribute to evidence for empowerment processes and outcomes experienced by users of health OSCs generally and highlight unique aspects of empowerment for users of OSCs with TDs and how these affect their experiences. OSCs appear to be an important tool in improving mental well-being through validation and recognition from peers, related to the acknowledgment of feelings of imposterism. Using OSCs can expand knowledge through exchanging information and experiences they may not have otherwise had access to-increasing empowerment through improvements in self-management and confidence in treatment decisions. However, this can also decrease trust in HCPs and negatively impact relationships due to decreased hope of assistance and fear of stigmatization for using OSCs. The authors suggest that recommendations regarding the use of OSCs are presented in self-management guidelines concerning coping strategies and the importance of peer support in living with tics.",

Factors associated with better prognosis were younger age, male sex, diagnosis early after disease onset, less lifetime psychiatric comorbidities, absence of depression, and discontinuation of secondary gain, while diagnostic acceptance or changes in daily social media time had no influence on prognosis. Of n\u2009=\u200926 patients (87%) receiving psychotherapy, n\u2009=\u200915 (58%) rated it as \"helpful,\" but neither the presence of therapy nor the type of therapeutic approach was associated with significant differences in symptom improvement. At FU, n\u2009=\u200913 (43%) patients received medication, which most (n\u2009=\u200911, 85%) felt ineffective. N\u2009=\u200911 patients (36.7%) indicated that simply knowing the correct diagnosis was helpful in terms of symptom improvement.\nIn line with previous reports in FTLB, patients with MSMI-FTLB also have a good prognosis overall, especially in the case of younger age, male sex, early diagnosis, discontinuation of secondary gain, less psychiatric comorbidities, and absence of depression.",

        "abstract": "Tourette syndrome (TS) is often comorbid with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and is associated with inhibitory control deficits. However, the differences in whole-brain functional connectivity (FC) between TS with and without ADHD and their neural basis for inhibitory control remain unclear. This study examines FC differences between these groups and their association with inhibitory control.\nWe recruited 52 children with TS (30 pure TS, 22 TS+ADHD) from Beijing Children's Hospital. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging was used to construct individual FC networks, and inhibitory control was assessed using the Go/No-Go task. Group differences in whole-brain FC were analyzed using the network-based statistic (NBS) approach, which identifies connected subnetworks showing significant differences between groups while controlling for multiple comparisons. Multivariate linear regression models examined associations between FC and inhibitory control, adjusting for ADHD comorbidity.\nCompared to the pure TS group, the TS+ADHD group showed decreased FC involving the default mode, somatomotor, and limbic networks. In both groups, inhibitory control had a positive correlation with FCs, predominantly involving the default mode, frontoparietal, somatomotor and attention networks. There were no significant group differences in FC related to inhibitory control.\nAlthough differences in FC were observed between the TS and TS+ADHD groups, both groups exhibited similar FC associated with inhibitory control. These findings highlight the neural impact of ADHD in TS and provide insights for future clinical interventions.",

Timely identification of TD and access to care can improve clinical outcomes. This retrospective study characterizes clinical features and initial pharmacotherapy in newly diagnosed pediatric TD.\nThis retrospective cohort study included 805 newly diagnosed pediatric TD patients. Tic severity was assessed using the Yale Global Tic Severity Scale (YGTSS), with patients stratified into mild (YGTSS scores\u2009<\u200925), moderate (25-50), and severe (>50) groups. Chi-square tests/Fisher-exact tests and Wilcoxon rank-sum tests compared group differences in baseline characteristics. Multivariate analyses identified factors associated with tic severity, and logistic regression analyses identified predictors of pharmacotherapy initiation.\nIn 805 subjects, 73.43%, 11.18% and 15.39% were classified into provisional tic disorder, chronic tic disorder, and Tourette syndrome (TS). The prevalence of comorbid attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) was higher in moderate (21.45%) and severe (36.36%) groups than in the mild group (15.60%). The diagnosis of Tourette syndrome (aOR\u2009=\u20091.40, 95% CI: 1.23-160.31), age at onset (aOR\u2009=\u20091.63, 95% CI: 1.22-2.18), and age at diagnosis (aOR\u2009=\u20091.63, 95% CI: 1.22-2.17), comorbid ADHD (aOR\u2009=\u20097.12, 95% CI: 1.39-36.43) were positively associated with greater tic severity. Clonidine patch (CAP) and traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) were the most common choices initial pharmacotherapy in newly diagnosed pediatric TD. Scores of YGTSS, comorbid ADHD predicted treatment initiation.\nThis study contributed insights into the clinical profiles across tic severity and pharmacotherapeutic approaches in newly diagnosed pediatric TD. The findings highlighted the independent associations between baseline factors and tic severity, as well as the predictors of pharmacotherapy initiation.

        "abstract": "This study aimed to evaluate glymphatic system function in children with Tourette syndrome (TS) using diffusion tensor image analysis along the perivascular space (DTI-ALPS), and explored its potential role in TS pathophysiology.\nSeventy-six children with TS and eighty-two age- and sex-matched typically developing (TD) controls underwent DTI scans. Glymphatic function was quantified using the ALPS index, derived from atlas-based regions of interest in the superior corona radiata and superior longitudinal fasciculus. We examined associations between the left ALPS index (ALPS_L) and clinical measures, including tic severity (Yale Global Tic Severity Scale, YGTSS) and quality of life (Gilles de la Tourette Syndrome Quality of Life Scale, GTS-QOL). Mediation analysis assessed whether tic severity mediated the relationship between ALPS_L and GTS-QOL subscales.\nThe ALPS_L was significantly reduced in the TS group compared to the TD group (P < 0.05). The ALPS_L showed significant negative correlations with YGTSS motor tic (r = -0.850, P < 0.001), total tic (r = -0.702, P < 0.001), and global tic severity (r = -0.629, P < 0.001). It was also negatively correlated with the physical/ADL (r = -0.265, P = 0.020) and obsessive-compulsive (r = -0.380, P < 0.001) subscales of GTS-QOL. Motor tic severity partially mediated the relationship between the ALPS_L and physical/ADL scores (\u03b2 = -0.037, 95% CI: [-0.060, -0.015]).\nChildren with TS exhibit altered glymphatic function, associated with tic severity and impaired quality of life.

Current treatments mainly include drugs (for example, neuroleptics), but the treatment strategies are often unsatisfactory. Retinoic acid, derived from vitamin A, plays a role in TS, as children with this condition often exhibit reduced serum levels of retinoic acid and 25-hydroxyvitamin D. Supplementing with either nutrient has been shown to alleviate tic severity and frequency. In this study, we aim to explore the therapeutic effects and possible mechanisms of vitamins A and D in TS.\n3,3-Iminodipropionitrile (IDPN) was used to induce acute TS-like symptoms in rats via striatal dopamine dysregulation. Then vitamins A (3\u202fmg/kg/d) and D (10ug/kg/d) were continuously administered by gavage for 8\u202fweeks. Stereotyped and head twitching behavior tests were then performed. High-performance liquid chromatography was used to determine serum levels of 25-OH-D3, calcium, phosphorus, and alkaline phosphatase in rats. The composition of intestinal flora was analyzed using 16S rRNA gene sequencing, and striatum metabolites were detected by untargeted metabolomics.\nThe experimental results showed that the tic phenotype of TS rats was significantly relieved after 8\u202fweeks of vitamin A and D treatment (\nThis study shows that vitamin A and D supplementation can significantly alleviate the tic phenotype of TS rats, which demonstrates an association between vitamin A/D-induced gut flora alterations and neurotransmitter changes.

Across conditions, VNS was reported to improve motor and non-motor, enhance synaptic plasticity, modulate neurotransmitter activity relevant to MDs (GABA, norepinephrine, dopamine, and acetylcholine), and reduce neuroinflammation.\nCurrent evidence supports the multimodal effect of VNS in MDs, particularly in PD, where the most consistent benefits were observed. Non-invasive taVNS represents a promising, safer alternative to iVNS.

        "doi": "10.3390/ijms26188831",
        "abstract": "Gilles de la Tourette syndrome (GTS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by motor and phonic tics, often including attention deficit, hyperactivity, and obsessive-compulsive behaviours. The pathophysiology involves the dysfunction of cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical circuits, primarily implicating dopaminergic hyperactivity, but also involving multiple different neurotransmitter systems. Treatment of GTS is complex, highly individualized, and influenced by considerable variability in symptom presentation. Behavioural approaches, such as Habit Reversal Therapy (HRT), play a key role, especially in milder cases. Pharmacological therapy is largely empirical and varies across countries, influenced by drug availability and the perceived risks of certain classes of drugs, particularly dopamine receptor blocking agents. Drug options for managing tics include dopamine receptor antagonists, monoamine depleting agents, and alpha-2 agonists, all of which require close monitoring for metabolic, cardiovascular, and neurological side effects. Botulinum toxin injections represent an effective solution for focal tics that are resistant to systemic treatments. Cannabinoids and antiepileptics have limited efficacy, yet they may still offer relevant therapeutic potential in selected cases. Serotonergic drugs are useful for treating obsessive-compulsive symptoms. For patients with refractory tics, deep brain stimulation (DBS) represents an intervention of last-resort; however, DBS remains off-label and consensus on optimal targets is lacking. This narrative review draws on both the relevant literature and extensive personal clinical experience to explore the complexities of managing GTS, with a focus on evidence-based treatments for tics and associated neuropsychiatric symptoms. A therapeutic algorithm is proposed, emphasizing a \"start low, go slow\" approach, combining pharmacological interventions with cognitive behavioural and surgical therapies, when needed. We underscore the importance of tailoring treatments to individual patient profiles and symptom variability over time, highlighting the need for further research in GTS management.",

        "abstract": "Spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) exhibit substantial clinical and genetic heterogeneity. SCAs primarily present with progressive ataxia as the cardinal clinical feature. However, they may co-occur with non-ataxic motor symptoms, including various movement disorders. Notably, certain SCA subtypes may present with movement disorders as their primary manifestation. This phenotypic complexity poses significant diagnostic challenges, particularly in distinguishing SCAs from other neurodegenerative conditions with overlapping presentations.\nThis study enrolled 35 probands initially diagnosed with movement disorders. Participants were stratified into hypokinetic movement disorders and hyperkinetic movement disorders groups. After excluding known genetic causes of movement disorders through targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) panel, negative cases received SCA repeat expansion testing. Genetically confirmed SCA cases received comprehensive clinical-genetic characterization.\nFour SCA cases were identified in the hypokinetic movement disorders group (\nWe characterized a novel clinical constellation in an SCA8-associated familial parkinsonism pedigree: Parkinson's disease -like phenotype with spastic paraplegia and levodopa responsive parkinsonism with dystonia. We report the first documented occurrence of Tourette syndrome in the pre-ataxic stage of SCA3, though it is more likely a coincidental comorbidity independent of SCA3 progression. Furthermore, our findings indicate that SCA subtypes presenting with movement disorder-dominant phenotypes are likely underestimated in clinical practice.",

Even though comorbidities are the main source of impairment in individuals with TS, family aggregation between TS and other neuropsychiatric disorders has been little explored. We therefore investigated associations of tic severity in probands with symptoms of ASD, ADHD, and ODD in their siblings and the influence of tic severity, age, and sex.\nThe sample of the present study stems from the European Multicenter Tics in Children Study (EMTICS), a longitudinal observational study, with the present subsample of 196 probands with TS and their 220 full siblings (54.1% girls). We analyzed associations of probands' tic severity with ASD, ADHD, and ODD symptoms in their siblings using generalized linear mixed-effect negative binomial regression models.\nHigher tic severity in probands was associated with higher scores of ASD symptoms in their siblings (IRR\u00a0=\u00a01.48, 95% confidence interval [95% CI] 1.03-2.12, \nThis multicenter study demonstrated a link between probands' current tic severity and siblings' neuropsychiatric symptoms. Our study suggests a familial link between TS and ASD-like symptoms, competencies as well as sex-specific associations with ADHD and ODD symptoms in female siblings. The current study sheds light on a broader family tendency and highlights the need for targeted prevention in this vulnerable population. Our findings, however, call for further studies to better understand the genetic and environmental aggregation of influences between individuals with TS, ADHD, and ODD and their siblings.",

        "abstract": "Tourette syndrome (TS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by intermittent involuntary, repetitive movements and vocalizations collectively referred to as tics. For participants with severe tics who are resistant to medication and behavioral therapy, deep brain stimulation (DBS) has emerged as a potential treatment. Suboptimal animal models and shortcomings in anatomical imaging have collectively hindered progress in understanding the neurophysiological basis of human tic generation.\nThis study investigates the mechanisms underlying tic generation across two DBS targets with simultaneous recordings-the centromedian thalamus (CM) and anterior globus pallidus internus (aGPi)-and their interactions.\nSix participants with TS underwent bilateral implantation of four total CM and aGPi leads connected to two adaptive neurostimulators. Preoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and postoperative computed tomography (CT) scans localized lead and contact locations in CM and aGPi. Neural signals were recorded over nine consecutive monthly visits, encompassing both tic and symptom-free states. No stimulation was applied during the recordings.\nRecordings from both human CM and aGPi revealed increased low-frequency (<20\u2009Hz) power during both motor and vocal tics. The pallido-thalamic coherence in the pathological 1-10\u2009Hz band was significantly greater during tics than in symptom-free states. The phase difference between the two nuclei was reduced during tics, with higher internuclear phase differences observed in the left hemisphere.\nThese findings reveal distinct neural dynamics in the basal ganglia-thalamus network during tic generation, providing insight into the pathophysiology underlying human TS. \u00a9 2025 The Author(s).

The median age at diagnosis was 7.3 years, with a male-to-female ratio of 3.7:1. The most common symptom was eye blinking/eye rolling. The rate of premonitory urge and the tic-related impact tended to increase with age. Male patients showed a higher prevalence of CTD and TS, as well as a greater comorbidity rate of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. And the rate of male patients was slightly positively correlated with age at onset. Most patients chose the monotherapy for the first time. Among them, the clonidine patch and traditional Chinese medicine were the most common choices.\nWe described the clinical phenotypes of paediatric patients with newly diagnosed TD in China. At the same time, we also explored the differences in TD subtypes, clinical characteristics and medication choices between patients in different age and gender groups, providing valuable real-world evidence for an early identification and individualised treatment in paediatric TD.",

        "abstract": "Tourette syndrome (TS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by recurrent motor and vocal tics, often accompanied by comorbid psychiatric symptoms. While pharmacological treatments are commonly used, they often provide incomplete symptom relief and may cause adverse effects. Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) has been increasingly applied in clinical practice and is considered a valuable complementary approach. This review summarizes current research on TS from the perspectives of genetics, pathophysiology, and TCM, with particular attention to how biological findings inform syndrome differentiation and treatment. Genetic studies have identified polymorphisms such as IL1RN and SLC1A3, which are associated with immune dysfunction and neurotransmitter imbalance, respectively. These findings may correspond to TCM syndromes such as \"Liver Wind Stirring Internally\", linked to inflammation, and \"Liver Yin Deficiency with Yang Hyperactivity\", associated with excitatory overactivity. Pathophysiological mechanisms, including cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical (CSTC) circuit abnormalities and dopaminergic dysregulation, have been recognized as core contributors to tic development. TCM interventions appear to target these mechanisms. Tianma Gouteng Decoction has been shown to regulate neurotransmitter function and reduce liver yang hyperactivity, while Ningdong Granule can inhibit neuroinflammatory responses by modulating microglial activity. These effects are consistent with modern findings on the neural and immune changes observed in TS. Moreover, clinical evidence supports that combining TCM with Western pharmacotherapy may improve overall treatment efficacy, reduce side effects, and enhance patient outcomes. By linking genetic and neural mechanisms with traditional syndrome patterns, this review offers a comprehensive framework for understanding and applying TCM in TS treatment. The integration of TCM principles with modern scientific knowledge may support more individualized and biologically informed approaches to care.",

        "abstract": "Nonmotor symptoms (NMSs) in pediatric movement disorders, such as tics, dystonia, and cerebral palsy (CP), are important to consider but can be often overlooked, despite their substantial impact on daily functioning and quality of life. Understanding which NMSs are evaluated in these patient groups, and by which tools, can support the shaping of future research, including the potential development of future dedicated NMS assesment instruments. The aim of this scoping review was to identify the scales and tools used in routine practice and/or in research to assess NMSs in children with movement disorders.\nA comprehensive search of MEDLINE, Embase, and PsycINFO was conducted for studies published between 1990 and 2023. Eligible studies included those that evaluated NMSs using scales in children aged 0-18 years with tic disorders, dystonia, or CP.\nA total of 382 studies were included. Most of the articles identified were cross-sectional, cohort, and case-control studies. Cognitive impairment, mental health, behavioral difficulties, and pain were most frequently assessed using standardized scales. However, self-esteem and communication-critical components of social functioning-were rarely evaluated. The assessment of sleep disturbance, fatigue, and gastrointestinal and urinary symptoms was also less frequently addressed. Notably, our methodological approach may have led to an overrepresentation of NMS assessment in CP, given the larger body of literature available for this condition.\nSignificant gaps exist in the evaluation of NMSs in pediatric movement disorders, particularly in areas such as pain, sleep, and gastrointestinal issues. While standardization of NMS assessment is needed, it is unclear whether disorder-specific tools are preferable to broader NMS-focused measures. Given the current lack of data, using general scales may be a pragmatic first step, with refinement into disorder-specific tools as our understanding of symptom patterns evolves. Cross-cultural validation is also essential to improve the applicability of NMS scales across diverse populations. Integrating NMS assessment into routine clinical practice and interdisciplinary care may facilitate early identification and better management of these symptoms.",

However, there has been limited exploration on how to conduct rapid, low-cost, and effective screening in large samples of children.This study collected data from all fifth-grade students in a district of Beijing, China, from 2018 to 2022. First, information from the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) was gathered for all samples. For children whose scores on any CBCL dimension exceeded the normal range, semi-structured interviews were conducted to clarify diagnoses. Subsequently, a random forest model was constructed to assess screening effectiveness.Among 104,276 participants, only 2.24% of children were diagnosed with a mental disorder following the two-step screening procedure, which is lower than the prevalence reported in epidemiological surveys. Among all diagnosed mental disorders, the highest prevalence was observed for Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), at 1.48%. Additionally, 5.49% of the patients exhibited comorbidities, with the most common being ADHD comorbid with ASD. Regarding specific disorders, the comorbidity rate for tic disorders (TD) was the highest at 34.78%. A random forest model was constructed to predict ADHD, depressive disorder, and ASD. The model performed exceptionally well in predicting normal children with specificity greater than 0.9; however, its predictive performance for patients was poor, with sensitivity below 0.2 and precision below 0.3.The two-step CBCL screening underestimates the true prevalence of mental disorders but shows high predictive accuracy for negative cases. Applying random forest to pre-exclude negatives in large samples can reduce screening costs and improve efficiency by focusing interviews on predicted positives.",

There are limited data on the relative rates of complications after DBS across different indications and targets in children. This study aimed to evaluate the safety of DBS surgery for children with movement disorders (MDs; dystonia, chorea, or tic disorders), drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE), or neurodevelopmental disorders, namely, self-injurious behavior (SIB).\nData were collected both prospectively and retrospectively from children implanted with DBS through the North American multicenter Child and Youth CompreHensIve Longitudinal Database for Deep Brain Stimulation and included demographic, clinical, operative, and postoperative variables. Complications included infection, noninfectious surgical site findings (dehiscence or seroma), hardware-related issues (disconnection or impedance change), intracranial injury, or other complications. The primary outcome was major complications, defined as any adverse event causing permanent neurologic injury or requiring surgical intervention. The secondary outcome was minor complications, defined as nonmajor complications. Generalized linear models were used to assess for any significant associations with complications.\nA total of 130 children and youth (mean age 12.2 \u00b1 4.2; range 3-18) years and weighing 12.5-126.6 kg underwent DBS. The most common indication was MD (77, 59.2%), followed by DRE (47, 36.2%) and SIB (6, 4.6%).

        "doi": "10.1111/adb.70036",
        "abstract": "Alcohol use disorder (AUD) represents a significant challenge in mental health. Severe AUD is characterized by uncontrolled alcohol consumption and is associated with dysregulation in brain circuits responsible for reward, motivation, decision-making, affect, and stress response. Mindfulness is known to positively influence those dysregulations and may enhance abstinence-related self-efficacy (confidence in resisting alcohol consumption), which is one of the best predictors for abstinence following inpatient treatment. Large-scale networks underlie mindfulness, including the default mode and salience network. This study aims to investigate the role of the cingulum bundle (CB) in patients with AUD, which bridges these two networks in relation to mindfulness and abstinence-related self-efficacy. We conducted a study with 39 recently abstinent inpatients with AUD and 18 healthy controls. Mindfulness and self-efficacy were assessed using standardized and validated self-report questionnaires. Structural and resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data were acquired to examine structural and functional connectivity of the cingulate cortex. Our findings showed reduced structural and functional connectivity of the CB in AUD patients with a highly positive association between these metrics. Overall, mindfulness correlated strongly with abstinence-related self-efficacy. We found no association of trait mindfulness and structural and functional findings of the cingulate cortex. However, exploratory analyses suggest a positive association between CB number of streamlines and mindfulness factors 'acceptance' and 'decentring', and abstinence-related self-efficacy. This is the first study indicating that patients with AUD have structural and functional impairments of the CB. These alterations could be associated with reduced mindfulness and self-efficacy.",

However, validation against clinical diagnostic assessments in a population-based sample has been lacking, limiting the implications for clinical practice, clinical research and public health decisions.\nStudy participants were recruited from the longitudinal Child and Adolescent Twin Study in Sweden (CATSS) inviting parents to all twins in Sweden. We investigated the psychometric properties of the A-TAC in 263 children, where one or both twins screened positive for neuropsychiatric problems, as well as control pairs, where both twins were screen negative. Study participants underwent thorough clinical examination within one year of the A-TAC interview. The psychometric properties of the A-TAC were then investigated. We also mapped the extent of comorbidity of neurodevelopmental disorders.\nUsing the A-TAC as screening for neurodevelopmental disorders we could discriminate two groups of children with clearly different occurrences of clinical diagnoses. The predictive screening properties of the A-TAC were good for most of the neurodevelopmental disorders (AUC ranging from 0.806 to 0.958), with exception for developmental coordination disorder (AUC\u2009=\u20090.616). More than 40% of children fulfilling diagnostic criteria for a neurodevelopmental disorder, also fulfilled diagnostic criteria for at least one other neurodevelopmental disorder.\nThis study confirms the utility of the A-TAC interview as a screening tool for neuropsychiatric disorders in a non-clinical sample. It also supports the necessity to maintain a broad diagnostic approach in clinical child psychiatric investigations for meaningful understanding of the child's problems. Although, A-TAC can be informative on neurodevelopmental problems in both clinical and population-based samples, it cannot replace a clinical neurodevelopmental investigation or be used to delimit individual access to specialized care.",

        "abstract": "In the ICD-10 the developmental disorders are categorized under three different chapters: F7 for mental retardation, F8 for developmental disorders and F9 for disorders with onset in childhood and adolescence. In ICD-11 neurodevelopmental disorders represent the first new main classification group. The disorders grouped in these categories are all characterized by essentially genetically related atypical patterns of perception, emotional processing, cognition (general and social), language and motor skills. These patterns of mental functioning usually manifest in the first decade of development. They represent persisting characteristics of mental functioning, which can be understood as structural diagnoses. As such, they do not always have pathological significance but must be understood as variants of the norm, at least in less severe cases. In such constellations, they often form the psychodynamic basis for characteristic patterns of interpersonal relationship and communication problems in a subsyndromic expression and hinder the development of valid and constructive identities. These psychodynamics are often associated with interpersonal problems and conflicts as well as classical psychiatric comorbidities, such as stress reactions, adjustment disorders, anxiety disorders, obsessive-compulsive disorders, depression, personality disorders or impulsive and psychotic states. Developmental disorders have a\u00a0high degree of overlap and comorbidity. This article summarizes the conceptual changes in ICD-11 compared to ICD-10, particularly with respect to the four main subgroups: intellectual disability, autism spectrum disorders, ADHD and tic disorders.\nDie Entwicklungsst\u00f6rungen sind bislang in der International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems\u00a010 (ICD-10) in drei Kapiteln konzeptionalisiert (F7, F8, F9). In der ICD-11 stellen sie die erste neue klassifikatorische Hauptgruppe dar. Die in dieser Kategorie zusammengefassten St\u00f6rungsbilder sind alle durch wesentlich genetisch bedingte musterhafte Besonderheiten der Wahrnehmung, Emotionsverarbeitung, allgemeinen und sozialen Kognition, Sprache und Motorik gekennzeichnet, die sich im Regelfall bereits in der ersten Lebensdekade zeigen. Es handelt sich dabei um anhaltende Besonderheiten des mentalen Funktionierens, die auch als Strukturdiagnosen verstanden werden k\u00f6nnen, aber nicht immer zwingend Krankheitswert besitzen. Sie bilden auch in einer subsyndromalen Auspr\u00e4gung h\u00e4ufig die psychodynamische Grundlage f\u00fcr sich darauf aufbauende Probleme im zwischenmenschlichen Miteinander, der Kommunikation, der Entwicklung eines stabilen Selbst sowie einer validen und integrierten Identit\u00e4t.

This study aims to analyze adverse drug events (ADEs) associated with fluvoxamine using the large-scale pharmacovigilance database FAERS, to assess its safety profile.\nThe FAERS database was used to collect data on ADEs related to fluvoxamine from the first quarter of 2004 to the third quarter of 2024. Disproportionality analyses were performed using the Reporting Odds Ratio (ROR), Proportional Reporting Ratio (PRR), Bayesian Confidence Propagation Neural Network (BCPNN), and Empirical Bayes Geometric Mean (EBGM) methods.\nA total of 355 ADEs reports related to fluvoxamine were identified, spanning 26 different System Organ Classes (SOCs) and 67 preferred terms (PTs). Psychiatric disorders were the most frequently reported ADEs. Notably, signals for reproductive system and breast disorders, cardiac disorders, and eye disorders were stronger but not related to the pharmacological properties of fluvoxamine, thus warranting special clinical attention. Disinhibition showed the highest signal strength in fluvoxamine and requires vigilance. A considerable number of drug interactions were noted, leading to increased antipsychotic drug levels and extrapyramidal symptoms, such as slow speech, drooling, and tardive dyskinesia. Self-harm and suicidal behavior necessitate clinical risk management. Additionally, significant symptoms of serotonin syndrome were observed, including tic, clonus, mydriasis, and myoclonus. Our study also uncovered ADEs not previously documented in product labels, such as Cushing's syndrome, papilloedema, and increased intracranial pressure.\nThis study provides a real-world pharmacovigilance analysis of fluvoxamine. It identifies several rare ADEs and clinically significant symptoms, particularly neuroleptic malignant syndrome and serotonin syndrome.

        "abstract": "This study aimed to investigate the association between anion gap (AG) and clinical outcomes in patients with trauma-induced coagulopathy (TIC), and to evaluate the predictive value of dynamic AG trajectories for 28-day mortality.\nA retrospective cohort study was conducted using the MIMIC-IV database, including 1,358 TIC patients (INR\u2009>\u20091.4 or PTT\u2009>\u200940\u00a0s). Demographics, laboratory data (including AG), vital signs, and severity scores within 24\u00a0h of ICU admission were collected. Latent class growth modeling was used to identify AG trajectories at 8, 16, and 24\u00a0h. The primary outcome was 28-day mortality, analyzed via Cox regression and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis.\nAmong 1,358 patients, the 28-day mortality rate was 19.9%. Non-survivors were older and had worse vital signs, higher AG, and lower platelet and bicarbonate levels (P\u2009<\u20090.05). Elevated AG was independently associated with increased mortality (HR\u2009=\u20092.615, P\u2009<\u20090.001), even after multivariate adjustment. Patients with AG\u2009>\u200914.5\u00a0mEq/L had significantly reduced 28-day survival (P\u2009<\u20090.001). Four distinct AG trajectories were identified; Class 4, with persistently rising AG, showed the highest mortality risk (HR\u2009=\u20092.46, P\u2009=\u20090.033).\nAG is an independent predictor of 28-day mortality in TIC patients. AG\u2009>\u200914.5\u00a0mEq/L and persistently elevated trajectories are associated with poor short-term outcomes, especially in those with renal dysfunction or myocardial infarction. Dynamic AG monitoring may help identify high-risk patients early and guide clinical management.",

        "abstract": "Tigecycline is widely used to treat multidrug-resistant infections. However, the high incidence of coagulopathy poses a significant clinical challenge. This observational study aimed to characterize the metabolomic profiles of critically ill patients receiving tigecycline and to identify potential metabolic traits to predict tigecycline-induced coagulopathy (TIC).\nA total of 53 patients were enrolled and classified into TIC and non-TIC groups. Serum samples were collected at trough (Cmin), mid-dose (C1/2), and peak (Cmax) tigecycline concentrations. LC-MS-based untargeted metabolomics was applied to characterize metabolic profiles across these timepoints and to identify metabolites potentially predictive of TIC.\nBy sequentially applying univariate analysis and multivariate LASSO-penalized Cox proportional hazards regression analysis, we identified 10, 10, and 9 metabolites at the Cmin, C1/2, and Cmax timepoints, respectively, as predictive markers of TIC. Importantly, patients with lower levels of lysophosphatidylcholines (LysoPCs) and lysophosphatidylethanolamines (LysoPEs) are more susceptible to coagulopathy following tigecycline therapy. In particular, receiver operating characteristic curve analysis of LysoPC (18:0), LysoPC (18:3), LysoPE (18:0), and LysoPE (18:4) measured at Cmin demonstrated an area under the curve close to 0.8, providing strong evidence for their potential as robust biomarkers for predicting TIC.\nOur study indicated that metabolomics could be a valuable tool for predicting the risk of TIC and suggested that LysoPCs and LysoPEs might serve as hypothesis-generating candidates for future studies exploring potential therapeutic interventions.",

Based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria, TCM prescriptions were extracted and entered into an Excel 2020 database. Statistical analyses, including frequency analysis, association rule mining, and hierarchical clustering, were performed using Excel 2020, SPSS Modeler 18.0, and SPSS Statistics 26.0 software.\nTotally 559 articles were included, comprising 1001 prescriptions, 369\u00a0herbs, and 13,678 frequencies. The properties of the herbs were primarily cold, warm, and mild, with the most common flavors being sweet, bitter, and pungent. The most frequent meridians were the liver, lung, and spleen. High-frequency herbs included Radix paeonia alba, Uncaria rhynchophylla, and Glycyrrhiza, etc. The primary efficacy included liver-soothing and wind-calming, tonifying spleen and Qi, and resuscitation-inducing aromatic, etc. The most frequent herb pairs were Uncaria rhynchophylla-Radix paeonia alba, Uncaria rhynchophylla-Glycyrrhiza, Radix paeonia alba-Glycyrrhiza, and Uncaria rhynchophylla-Glycyrrhiza-Radix paeonia alba, Radix paeonia alba-Gastrodia elata-Uncaria rhynchophylla. Forty herbs had a frequency of >100, which could be classified into 6 clusters: (1) hepatotropic and neuroregulatory herbs; (2) tonifying herbs; (3) hydragogue and dampness-regulating herbs, etc. Additionally, there were specific herb combinations such as Bupleurum chinense for liver-soothing, insect herbs for wind-expelling and meridian-unblocking, and Angelica sinensis and Ligusticum wallichii for removing blood stasis.\nThis study highlights the key medication principles and herb combinations used in the treatment of TD with TCM, providing valuable insights into current treatment practices. Further research, including standardized clinical assessments and investigation into the mechanisms of these herbs and their combinations, is needed to validate and optimize their potential therapeutic effects.",

        "doi": "10.1016/j.japh.2025.102946",
        "abstract": "Outpatient pharmacy settings, such as ambulatory care clinics, serve patients by addressing their medical needs and providing longitudinal pharmacy healthcare services within their communities. In the U.S., approximately 83% of people have experienced a traumatic event in their lifetime, and these exposures can significantly impact their long-term health outcomes. Trauma-informed care (TIC) is an approach to healthcare that recognizes and responds to the impact of trauma on individuals in ways that promote healing and recovery and avoid re-traumatization. This article aims to guide ambulatory care pharmacists on implementing trauma-informed care (TIC) to improve patient outcomes. This guidance includes how to recognize signs and symptoms of trauma, navigate trauma disclosures, build trust with survivors through trauma-informed communication, and report abuse in a pharmacy ambulatory care setting, highlighting the crucial role of pharmacists in this process. Trauma-informed practices and care in ambulatory settings are not just important but essential due to the ongoing nature of care and the management of chronic health conditions in patients who have experienced trauma, underscoring the significance of pharmacists' roles in patient care. Although the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) has outlined trauma-informed care (TIC) approaches, there is a gap in training within the Doctor of Pharmacy program and a lack of published literature on using TIC in specific settings. The effective use of TIC in ambulatory care settings can significantly improve patient care and, ultimately, patient health outcomes, making pharmacists an integral part of the healthcare process.",

        "abstract": "Tourette syndrome (TS) and chronic motor or vocal tic disorder (CTD) are neurodevelopmental disorders associated with functional impairment and reduced quality of life. Behavioral therapy (BT) is an effective treatment, but lack of experienced practitioners makes it hard for patients to receive appropriate help. One approach to bridge the gap between demand and availability is to offer the treatment remotely over the internet with minimal support from a therapist.\nThis single-blind randomized controlled superiority trial including 110 participants will compare internet-delivered BT (I-BT) primarily consisting of exposure and response prevention (ERP) to a control condition consisting of internet-delivered general psychological support. The primary aim of the trial is to evaluate whether ERP-based I-BT is superior to the control condition in reducing TS/CTD symptoms. The primary outcome measure is the Yale Global Tic Severity Scale - Total Tic Severity score administered by blinded raters at primary endpoint 11 weeks after the treatment start. Secondary endpoints occur at week 23 and 14 months after the treatment start, and the secondary outcomes include tic-related impairment, rates of responders, self-rated tic severity, symptoms of depression, quality of life and cost-effectiveness. Data on dropout rates and adverse events is also collected.\nThis is the first randomized controlled trial to evaluate therapist-guided ERP-based I-BT for adults with TS/CTD. The study has been approved by the Swedish Ethical Review Authority (EPM 2023-06541-01). The hypotheses were pre-registered before the start of the data collection. Results from all analyses will be reported according to the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials statement for non-pharmacological trials (CONSORT) and Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards (CHEERS). The participants in the control condition will have the opportunity to receive I-BT after the data from the first follow-up is collected. The study will be published in open access and the results will be shared with service user organizations. At the moment of submission, the study has recruited 87 out of 110 planned participants and the recruitment is expected to be completed in February 2025.\nOpen Science Framework: https://osf.io/cq97b/ (uploaded 31/01/2024); Clinicaltrials.gov: NCT06271083 (submitted 14/02/2024).",

        "abstract": "Tics and comorbidities significantly impact the social interactions and mental health of adolescents with Tourette syndrome (TS). Psychoeducation is an initial intervention for TS. Gamification is a common psychoeducational intervention for youths with chronic conditions. However, the effectiveness of board games in improving tic severity and mental health in adolescents with TS remains underexplored.\nWe developed a serious board game to investigate its effects on tic severity, mental health, social adjustment, and depression in adolescents with TS.\nA single-blinded, 2-arm, parallel randomized controlled study was conducted. From September 2022 to July 2024, participants were recruited from a medical center in northern Taiwan. Seventy-nine adolescents with TS aged 12 to 18 years were randomly assigned to either a control group (n=39) or an intervention group (n=40). Both groups received care as usual (daily pyridoxine [50 mg] and psychoeducation), while the intervention group additionally participated in a weekly 60-minute board game session over a 4-week period. Outcome measures included the Yale Global Tic Severity Scale, Positive Mental Health Scale, Social Adjustment Scale for Adolescents with TS, and Beck Youth Inventory II - Depression scale.\nGeneralized estimation equation results showed that, compared to the control group, the intervention group demonstrated significant improvements in positive mental health at the postintervention (\u03b2=5.19, 95% CI 0.36 to 10.02, P=.04) and follow-up (\u03b2=7.14, 95% CI 2.15 to 12.14, P=.005), with time-dependent effects. The intervention group also showed significant improvements in social adjustment (\u03b2=4.24, 95% CI 1.79 to 6.69, P<.001) and depression (\u03b2=-3.06, 95% CI -6.04 to -0.11, P=.04) at follow-up. No significant differences were observed between the 2 groups in tic severity.\nThe serious board game developed in this study significantly enhanced psychosocial functioning in adolescents with TS. As an alternative to verbal and written health communication, the board game serves as an innovative psychoeducational instrument for health care professionals to help adolescents with TS in tic management and mental health promotion. Future studies can develop and validate the feasibility of a digital version of the board game.\nClinicalTrials.gov NCT05566236; https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05566236.",

This study aimed to explore the lived experiences of accessing healthcare for people with CTD or TS and their families in the United Kingdom (UK), as part of a larger programme of work to inform change to healthcare services for this population.\nInformed and designed with extensive patient and public involvement, the design utilised qualitative research using focus groups. Reflexive thematic analysis was used to analyse the data.\nParticipants were recruited via online support groups, social media and research registers.\nSeven focus groups were held separately with young people with tics (n=2), adults with tics (n=10) and parents/guardians of children with tics (n=11), led by a lived experience expert (coauthor PS) and facilitated by researchers. Discussion focused on three areas: the impact of living with tics, experience accessing healthcare for tics and management of tics.\nFive themes were developed highlighting challenges across the healthcare pathway, including gaining a diagnosis, and receiving treatment, resulting in the use of self-support methods to reduce tic expression or the impact of tics. Themes also illustrated perceptions that healthcare provider's knowledge impacted initial interactions with the healthcare system, and how healthcare systems were not felt to be prioritising CTDs.\nThe findings highlight a lack of prioritisation for tic disorders compounded by a healthcare structure which does not support a complex condition that requires a multidisciplinary approach.

        "abstract": "Chronic cough in adults is commonly caused by respiratory disorders (e.g., cough variant asthma, CVA), ear, nose and throat (ENT) disorders (e.g., postnasal drip), digestive disorders (e.g., gastroesophageal reflux disease, GERD), as well as anaphylaxis and allergy. Tic cough is infrequent in adults but warrants consideration in individuals who have excluded these somatic disorders and exhibit inadequate response to diagnostic treatments, especially those with a history of tic disorder or ongoing tic symptoms. In these cases, a multi-disciplinary treatment (MDT) for chronic cough that includes psychiatrists is recommended as the optimal management approach.",

        "abstract": "The majority of patients with chronic tic disorders suffer from psychiatric comorbidities, most frequently attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), depression, and anxiety. While characteristics of these psychiatric disorders are widely known, other comorbidities including self-injurious behaviors (SIB) and body focused repetitive behaviors (BFRB) are still under-investigated. Currently, there is a controversial discussion whether BFRB and SIB belong to the same spectrum because of clinical similarities or they represent distinct entities. In this study, we investigated the clinical profile of BFRB in a large sample of adult patients (N\u2009=\u2009123) with chronic tic disorders. Current urge and/or behavior to perform BFRB was reported by 59 participants (48%). BFRB were overall more frequent in females, individuals with comorbid OCD, and more severe tics. Both urges and behaviors to perform BFRB had a negative impact on quality of life. When comparing patients with comorbid SIB and those with comorbid BFRB, SIB was found in younger patients with more severe tics and comorbid ADHD. From our data it is suggested that SIB and BFRB belong to the same spectrum with SIB indicating the more severe clinical manifestation.",

After 1\u2009year of medication treatment, patients were categorised into relapse and no relapse groups based on recurrence within 6\u2009months post-medication discontinuation. Clinical data from both groups were compared, and multivariate binary logistic regression analysis was used to determine independent risk factors for recurrence.\nSignificant differences were found between the relapse and no relapse groups in age (p\u2009=\u20090.003), white blood cell count (p\u2009=\u20090.001), Mycoplasma pneumoniae antibody IgM (p\u2009=\u20090.009), tic characteristics (p\u2009=\u20090.025), and medication treatment (p\u2009=\u20090.001). Binary logistic regression analysis identified Mycoplasma pneumoniae antibody IgM (OR\u2009=\u20094.797, 95% CI: 1.826-12.605) and vocal tics (OR\u2009=\u20098.202, 95% CI: 2.751-24.455) as independent risk factors for recurrence. Age (OR\u2009=\u20090.519, 95% CI: 0.335-0.803) and Aripiprazole (OR\u2009=\u20090.091, 95% CI: 0.031-0.271) were identified as protective factors.\nMycoplasma infection, and vocal tics are significant risk factors for recurrence in children with chronic tic disorders. Increased age and the use of aripiprazole may serve as protective factors and be considered for clinical management of chronic tic disorders in children.",

An urgent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) to treat LAD was carried out because of ECG modifications and chest pain immediately after CA. During the procedure a septal collateral perforation occurred leading to abrupt development of a large intraventricular septal hematoma (IVSH). Urgent embolization of the distal septal branch with coils was performed using block and deliver (BAD) technique. Rapid hematoma expansion involved another proximal septal collateral. A prompt second coil embolization was carried out arresting the growth of hematoma expansion. The patient was discharged home in stable condition after close observation in Coronary Care Unit (CCU), and subsequently in a low-intensity care unit. Complete resolution of IVSH was confirmed by transthoracic echocardiogram 2 months later. Timely management of the septal perforation and close echocardiographic monitoring resulted in complete hematoma resolution and a satisfactory outcome.",

        "abstract": "Tic spectrum disorders-Gilles de la Tourette's syndrome (GTS) and Persistent (Chronic) Motor Tic Disorder (CMTD)-are neurodevelopmental conditions characterized by recurrent motor and/or vocal tics persisting for at least 1 year. While tics are the primary symptom, pain related to tics is an important yet often overlooked aspect of these disorders. Pain can result from the repetitive nature of tics, leading to muscle strain, joint stress, or even injury due to the forceful execution of movements. Additionally, pain resulting from rapid and repeated movements or vocalizations can contribute to chronic discomfort, significantly affecting daily functioning and quality of life. Despite its impact, tic-related pain is not always addressed in clinical practice, leaving individuals struggling to find effective management strategies. The aims of this study were to assess tic-related pain, pain coping strategies and beliefs, and to investigate whether individuals experiencing pain seek professional help and how effective they perceive such interventions to be.\nA total of 76 participants diagnosed with GTS and CMTD participated in the study. The following scales were used: Yale Global Tic Severity Scale (YGTSS), Visual Analog Scale (VAS), Short-Form McGill Pain Questionnaire-2 (SF-MPQ-2), Pain Coping Strategies Questionnaire (CSQ), Beliefs Questionnaire for Pain Control (BPCQ), and a survey containing demographic and health data and questions about pain management and its effectiveness.\n73.7% of participants reported tic-related pain; almost all of them declared pain located in more than one part of the body. Affective pain domain was the highest scored by both men and women. Coping self-statements was the most common coping strategy chosen by men, whereas catastrophizing was preferred by women. Respondents rated internal factors as the most important in pain management and external factors, particularly medical professionals, as the least important. This aligns with their experience, as fewer than one in five found professional interventions effective in relieving pain.\nPain should be recognized as a common comorbid aspect of tic disorders and therefore both pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions should include pain management. Chronic pain can significantly impair functioning in all areas of life and recommendations for the management of tic-related pain need to be developed.",

Attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and other comorbidities have been linked to delays in early developmental milestones. Few studies have investigated the relationship between early developmental milestones, tic severity, and related comorbidities.\n383 participants aged 3-16\u00a0years (76.8%, n\u2009=\u2009294 boys) with CTD from the baseline assessment of the European Multicenter Tics in Children Study (EMTICS), were evaluated for: retrospective early developmental milestones (sitting, walking, first words, complete a sentence, bladder and bowel control), tic severity, tic-related functional impairment, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), ADHD, oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) and suspected ASD. Data was collected using gold-standard self and clinician reporting instruments. Analyses included Pearson correlations and logistic regressions.\nCorrelations between the acquisition of developmental milestones and tic severity or impairment were significant with small effect sizes (severity of motor tics and tic impairment were correlated with walking (r\u2009=\u2009.11), while vocal tics were correlated with first words (r\u2009=\u2009.12)). Logistic regression revealed that delayed acquisition of first words was significantly associated with ADHD, ODD and suspected ASD (Odds Ratio (ROR): 1-1.13, 1.04-1.22, 1.05-1.21, respectively), while delayed walking acquisition was associated with OCD (ROR: 1.01-1.27).\nThis study highlights the association between early developmental milestones and later psychopathological comorbidities in CTD patients.

        "abstract": "Tic disorders (TD) are childhood-onset neurodevelopmental disorders characterized by sudden, repetitive motor and vocal tics, often with partial or complete remission by the time young adulthood is reached. We here investigated motor control and compensatory neural processes in drug-na\u00efve children and adolescents with chronic Motor Tic Disorder or Tourette Syndrome (TD) by examining motor network activity and connectivity compared to healthy controls. Using a reaction time (RT) task under varying cueing conditions, combined with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and dynamic causal modelling (DCM), we explored how TD-related motor networks adapt to support volitional movement control. Participants with TD demonstrated enhanced task accuracy across internally and externally cued conditions despite deficits in sustained motor inhibition (blink suppression). Relative to controls, individuals with TD exhibited increased task-related activation in ipsilateral motor regions, particularly in the primary motor cortex, and somatosensory cortex, and enhanced interhemispheric connectivity between parietal sensory-motor hubs. Notably, while in typically developing participants, age-related increases in parietal lobe activation and modulatory connectivity between primary motor and premotor regions were linked to improved task accuracy, working memory and visuomotor coordination, TD patients deviated from this normative developmental trajectory with distinct, atypical but neither delayed nor accelerated neural activation and connectivity patterns. Our data suggest that TD involves compensatory neuroplastic adaptations that leverage additional sensorimotor resources to improve motor control but do not extend to motor inhibition processes. Moreover, the findings emphasize the intricate interplay between motor control and neural plasticity in TD, highlighting how compensatory mechanisms may serve as adaptive responses to motor challenges. These findings open avenues for therapeutic strategies that harness the brain's compensatory capacities to enhance motor control and facilitate TD management.",

        "abstract": "Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) is a neurodegenerative disease that can only be diagnosed post-mortem via pathological autopsy. The primary risk factor for CTE is a history of repetitive head impacts (RHI) received through contact sports including American football, hockey or soccer, military-related head injuries, or intimate partner violence. Recent findings have demonstrated that neuroinflammation is a critical compo-nent of early CTE pathogenesis and is likely part of the mechanism driving disease onset and progression. Additionally, the innate specificity, or 'signature', of a neuroinflammatory response may function as a dis-ease-specific marker for various neurodegenerative conditions. This would suggest an enormous repository of novel CTE biomarker candidates to be added to ongoing clinical trials, helping bolster diagnosis. However, few studies have truly leveraged immune mediators as candidate CTE markers. In this review, we argue and provide support that inflammatory mechanisms could serve as a viable source for novel biomarkers that are specific to CTE pathol-ogy. This includes an evaluation of inflammatory or damage-related markers such as CCL11 (C-C Motif Chem-okine Ligand 11, also known as Eotaxin-1), CCL21 (C-C Motif Chemokine Ligand 21) and GFAP (Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein). We discuss the neuroinflammatory responses that give rise to these biomarkers in addition to the advantages and limitations of using each to diagnose CTE with particular attention to sensitivity and specifici-ty. Although further research is necessary to validate immune mediators, the latter show promise as diagnos-tic biomarkers for CTE and may also eventually serve as therapeutic targets for mitigating chronic inflamma-tion in at-risk populations.",

While medication and behavioral therapies are established treatments, chronic use of medication can cause side effects, and behavioral therapy faces limited provider availability and geographic barriers. Internet-based behavioral interventions are emerging as alternatives to improve treatment accessibility.\nWe performed a meta-analysis of five randomized controlled trials examining online delivery of comprehensive behavioral interventions for tics/habit reversal training or exposure and response prevention for tic disorders. Primary outcomes included Yale Global Tic Severity Scale scores and treatment response rate. A fixed-effect model was used, with heterogeneity and subgroup analyses to assess consistency.\nThe overall Hedges' g was -0.26 (95% CI: -0.42 to -0.10, \nIn this meta-analysis, internet-based behavior therapy demonstrated modest yet statistically significant reductions in tic symptoms, marginally lower than those achieved with in-person. Nevertheless, their cost-effectiveness and potential to broaden treatment accessibility underscore the necessity for large-scale, methodologically rigorous trials that explore long-term outcomes, developmental considerations, and comorbidities.

This study explored clinical manifestations of TD in patients with the chief complaint of abnormal blinking; its goal was to reduce misdiagnosis and missed diagnosis.\nIn total, 1054 patients with the chief complaint of abnormal blinking completed a questionnaire and underwent comprehensive ophthalmic examinations and mental health assessments. Questionnaire data were compiled for patients with a confirmed diagnosis of TD; their clinical characteristics were analyzed.\nOf the 1054 patients presenting with abnormal blinking, 453 (42.98%) were diagnosed with a TD. Among these 453 patients, 253 (55.63%) had provisional tic disorder (PTD). 121 (26.71%) patients initially were misdiagnosed (primarily with AC) or experienced a missed diagnosis; Patients with PTD were more likely to seek ophthalmologic care, whereas those with CTD or TS were more likely to visit a paediatrician (P<0.001). The predominant eye tics were excessive and/or frequent blinking; 438 (96.69%) patients exhibited tics other than eye tics. Among the TD patients, 371 (81.90%) reported ocular symptoms, whereas 336 (74.17%) had comorbid eye diseases including AC and DED. PTD patients with AC had higher incidences of allergic rhinitis and asthma compared with patients displaying CTD and TS (P<0.05).\nTD are major causes of abnormal blinking, and PTD is the most common subtype. TD patients with abnormal blinking often have comorbid eye diseases, primarily AC and DED.",

        "abstract": "Chronic Tic Disorders (CTDs) including Tourette's Disorder are common pediatric conditions that, like many other mental health conditions, are under-recognized and under-managed in the primary care setting. Pediatric Primary Care Providers (PCPs) often feel undertrained in mental health evaluation and management, but the Medical Home partnership between PCPs and their patients and families usually serves as the most available opportunity for timely and comprehensive assessment and care coordination of mental health concerns; PCPs and families may feel confused, surprised, and bewildered by the wide range in the clinical presentations of tics and their seemingly dissimilar coexisting conditions that appear to blur the margins between mental health and neurology. This article endeavors to teach PCPs - who can thereby teach families of children with CTDs - a general clear and understandable principle that bridges mental and behavioral health with neurophysiology. This principle is one of \"disinhibition,\" which is believed to underpin tic behaviors and a variety of symptoms of frequent coexisting conditions. The teaching approach set out in this article is schematic and takes advantage of active learning methods. Once understood, families and PCPs can then use their knowledge of disinhibition to help prioritize concerns and engage with greater purpose and direction in management of symptoms, anticipation of possible symptom evolution, and to advocate more persuasively for appropriate educational or related services when indicated.",

        "abstract": "Persistent motor and vocal tic disorders (PMTD/PVTD) are distinct diagnoses from Tourette syndrome (TS). In both, the threshold for the diagnosis is up to age 18, whereas tics infrequently manifest after age 12. In our cohort of youth with tic disorders from Calgary, Canada, we aimed to determine whether the clinical features and comorbidity profile of PMTD/PVTD differ from those of TS, and assess whether chronic tic disorders with adolescent-onset (age\u2009\u2265\u200912) are different from disorders with childhood-onset (<\u200912\u00a0yr). A total of 341 children and adolescents with primary chronic tic disorders were included (90.0% with TS, 7.0% with PMTD, 1.8% with PVTD). Regarding age at tic onset, participants with adolescent-onset tics (6.7%) were diagnosed with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder\u00a0(ADHD) more often than those with childhood-onset (p\u2009=\u20090.02); there were no differences in sex ratio, tic severity and impairment. Regarding tic disorder diagnosis, participants with PMTD/PVTD had a later age at tic onset than those with TS (p\u2009=\u20090.01) and had less psychiatric comorbidity (p\u2009=\u20090.01), specifically ADHD and obsessive-compulsive disorder; there were no differences in tic severity or impairment. Given that the major difference between TS and PMTD/PVTD lies in psychiatric comorbidities, which are not part of the diagnostic criteria, we suggest creating a single category for primary persistent tic disorders. Tic onset in adolescence is uncommon, and coupled with the lack of any major difference in clinical features, should lead us to question whether the age limit in the diagnostic criteria might not be more relevant as a supportive criterion.",

        "abstract": "Caregivers of a person with aphasia (PWA) often lack knowledge about aphasia and have difficulty acting as effective conversation partners, feeling excluded and passive. Promoting the interlocutor's proficiency in the ability to support the PWA in a conversation is essential for improving patient-caregiver relationships.\nThis observational study aims to test a newly developed method, that is, TIC-TAC (which was derived from the Italian acronym 'Training di Istruzione alla Comunicazione Tra persona Afasica e Caregiver' (English transl. 'Communication Training Education for a Person with Aphasia and a Caregiver'), which was specifically designed to enhance the communicative competence of non-professional caregivers in their interaction with PWAs.\nWe enrolled 42 PWA-caregiver dyads. Three dyads dropped out from the study: Thus, the final sample included 39 dyads. The 'Caregiver Communication Assessment in Aphasia-Checklist' (ACCA-cl) evaluated the caregiver's communicative competence before and after the administration of the TIC-TAC method. This scale detects the verbal, para-verbal and non-verbal components of communication during the interaction with the patient.\nComparisons between pre- and post-method ACCA-cl scores showed a significant difference between T\nThe application of the TIC-TAC method to caregivers of PWAs yielded promising data regarding its impact on the evolution of caregivers' communicative competence across three representative levels of communication (verbal, para-verbal and non-verbal).\nWhat is already known on the subject Over the years, some training packages have been developed to improve communication between people with aphasia and their conversation partners. However, many of these programs were developed for healthcare professionals or students rather than for non-professional caregivers, limiting their accessibility and real-world applicability. Moreover, existing training methods have often been designed for individuals in the chronic phase of recovery, neglecting the need for communication support in earlier stages of rehabilitation. What this paper adds to the existing knowledge The 'TIC-TAC' method, from the Italian acronym 'Training di Istruzione alla Comunicazione Tra persona Afasica e Caregiver' (English transl. 'Communication Training Education between a Person with Aphasia and a Caregiver'), is an educational instrument centred on the caregiver-aphasic patient dyad that is easy to administer in terms of time and procedure, feasible in all rehabilitation services, adaptable to different stages and forms of aphasic disorder and effective to improve the caregiver's communicative competence in daily communication with his/her loved one. What are the potential or actual clinical implications of this work? This study showed the positive effects of a new method tailored to enhance the communicative competence of caregivers of persons with aphasia. The TIC-TAC method is an educational and informative counselling method addressed to caregivers and available in the professional practice of speech therapists working with adult aphasic patients.",

        "abstract": "Tourette syndrome (TS) is a chronic neurodevelopmental disorder with childhood onset characterized by multiple motor tics and at least one vocal tic, with symptoms persisting for over one year. Its exact etiology remains unclear. Identifying novel therapeutic targets for TS is critically important.\nWe utilized cis-expression quantitative trait loci (cis-eQTLs) of druggable genes obtained from the eQTLGen Consortium and genome-wide association study (GWAS) data for TS from the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium as the outcome to simulate the effects of pharmacological interventions on TS via Mendelian randomization (MR). Colocalization analyses were then conducted to validate the findings. To further corroborate these results, we investigated the role of DNA methylation in mediating the relationship between druggable gene expression and TS.\nThe expression of seven druggable genes was significantly associated with TS susceptibility (FDR\u2009<\u20090.05). TS susceptibility and three key genes (RET, CAPNS1, and LAMA5) were likely to share a causal variant. Further DNA methylation analysis identified seven critical methylation sites (cg02605258, cg02907768, cg06026331, cg09831553, cg12382846, cg19674797, and cg20752878), which indirectly influence TS development by regulating LAMA5 gene expression.\nLAMA5 is the most promising potential drug target for mitigating TS risk. Our study not only reveals potential therapeutic targets but also provides directions for future TS drug development.\nThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s13052-025-02048-x.",

We calculated prevalence ratios, 95% confidence intervals, and corresponding P-values using SAS software.\nAmong enrollees with commercial and Medicaid insurance, we identified 27,262 and 19,980 individuals with tic disorders, respectively. Overall, approximately 20% (21.4% commercial; 22.5% Medicaid) of individuals with tic disorders had any chronic pain. After stratifying by insurance type, age, and sex, prevalences of any pain and each pain type assessed were 1.1 to 7.5 times higher among those with tic disorders than those without tic disorders (P\u2009<\u20090.0001).

        "abstract": "Rotator cuff tears (RCTs) commonly cause shoulder pain and functional impairment in middle-aged and elderly individuals. Despite their varying clinical presentations, the mechanisms underlying pain development and exacerbation in RCT remain poorly understood. The relationship between increased blood flow around the shoulder joint and pain has recently attracted increasing attention. Dynamic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been established as an imaging study for assessing local hemodynamics in various fields, and we utilized this technique to evaluate hemodynamic changes in the shoulder structures. This study aimed to assess hemodynamic changes in shoulder structures using dynamic MRI in patients with painful RCT and to examine their correlation with motion and nocturnal pain.\nWe conducted a cross-sectional study of 54 patients with symptomatic full-thickness RCT. Patients underwent dynamic MRI for 3 min, and time-intensity-curve was analyzed to evaluate hemodynamics in the torn tendon stump (Stump), surrounding subacromial bursa (Bursa), rotator interval, axillary pouch (AP), and deltoid muscle. The peak enhancement ratio (PER) and enhanced slope (ESL), which reflect the blood flow volume and velocity, were obtained from the time-intensity-curve. Pain intensity was measured using a 100 mm visual analog scale (VAS) during shoulder motion in daily activities (motion pain) and bedtime at night (nocturnal pain). Chronic pain-related questionnaires were used to assess psychological problems.\nDynamic MRI revealed significantly higher PER and ESL in the Bursa, rotator interval, and AP than in the deltoid muscle. The Stump demonstrated significantly lower PER and ESL than the other structures. The motion pain VAS was positively correlated with PER and ESL in the Bursa and AP, whereas nocturnal pain VAS showed positive correlations with the Bursa and negative correlations with the Stump. There were no significant associations between VAS pain scores and demographic or chronic pain-related questionnaire data.\nAbundant hemodynamic activity within the Bursa and AP resulted in severe motion pain that reflected focal bursitis, probably due to subacromial impingement and secondary glenohumeral synovitis. Conversely, opposing hemodynamics, ie reduced vascular perfusion in the Stump and increased vascular perfusion in the Bursa were linked to higher nocturnal pain, suggesting ischemia at the torn tendon and synovitis of the surrounding bursa. These findings highlight the role of local hemodynamics in the pathophysiology of RCT-related pain and provide insights that may help explore new treatment approaches targeting hemodynamic alterations.",

Despite their prevalence, these disorders are frequently underdiagnosed and poorly managed due to limited healthcare access and lack of specialized services. An online survey was conducted in Italy to assess access to care and the impact of TS/TD on social, educational, and occupational life.\nA nationwide online survey, including 100 participants (mean age 23.1, SD 14.6; M:F=77:33), was developed to assess diagnostic-therapeutic processes and quality of life (QoL) in TS/TD. The survey had three sections: 1) Access to Care, 2) Tic Severity, and 3) Impact of TS/TD.\nDiagnosis was delayed by an average of 7.7 years. The lack of clear information was a major issue, with caregivers reporting easier access to information than youths and adults with TS/TD (p= .042, OR: 0.37). Pharmacological treatment was the most common (53% currently, 63% previously), while psychotherapy was more common among children and early adolescents (50%) compared to older participants (25.6%) (p= .037). Specialized cognitive-behavioral treatments, such as EPT and HRT, were rare, with only 7% receiving HRT and none undergoing EPT. Comorbidities had a significantly greater impact on QoL than tics (p= .004, Cohen's d=0.3).\nThese findings highlight the need for improved access to specialized care, greater healthcare professional awareness, and enhanced support for individuals with TS/TD and their families, especially for early diagnosis and effective cognitive behavioral treatments.",

        "abstract": "Tourette syndrome (TS) is a chronic neurodevelopmental tic disorder with a considerable quality of life (QOL) burden.\nThe goal was to determine the long-term safety, tolerability, and clinical effects of ecopipam, a first-in-class dopamine D1 receptor antagonist, for TS.\nThis 12-month, open-label extension (OLE) study enrolled patients age \u22656 to \u226418\u2009years with confirmed TS who completed a phase 2b randomized, placebo-controlled, 12-week trial. Ecopipam was titrated over 4\u2009weeks to achieve a target oral dose of 1.8\u2009mg/kg/day. Study visits occurred at baseline, monthly for 12\u2009months, and 7 and 14\u2009days after last dose.\nA total of 121 patients were included (74% male; 68% age 12-18\u2009years), and 80 (66%) completed the study. Ecopipam was well tolerated. The most common adverse events were nasopharyngitis (14.0%) and anxiety (9.1%). At month 12, there were no significant changes from baseline in body mass index Z-score (mean [standard deviation] change, 0.05 [0.43]; P\u2009=\u20090.35), glycated hemoglobin (0.03% [0.31]; P\u2009=\u20090.60), or total cholesterol (0.2\u2009mmol/L [0.7]; P\u2009=\u20090.14). No notable changes in scales assessing akathisia, movement disorders, anxiety, or depression occurred. At all time points, significant improvements (P\u2009<\u20090.001 vs. baseline) in both the Yale Global Tic Severity Scale Total Tic Score and the Gilles de la Tourette Syndrome Quality of Life Scale for Children and Adolescents total score were observed.\nTwelve months of ecopipam dosing was well tolerated during this study and no new adverse events were detected. Compared to baseline, significantly reduced TS symptom severity and improved QOL were observed in children and adolescents.",

Although cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is an evidence-based treatment, access remains limited.\nTo evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of a smartphone-delivered, coach-led CBT program for depression among individuals with psoriasis.\nThis single-arm, 8-week pilot study (Mindset trial, NCT06216691) enrolled adults with psoriasis and at least mild depressive symptoms (PHQ-9 \u22655). Participants engaged in a smartphone-based CBT program guided by bachelor's-level lay coaches. Primary outcomes were feasibility as evaluated by module completion and acceptability as evaluated by the Client Satisfaction Questionnaire-8 (CSQ-8]) and User Version of the Mobile Application Rating Scale (uMARS). Secondary outcomes included changes in the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), General Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7), Appearance Anxiety Inventory, Skindex-16, and Psoriasis Symptom Inventory.\nOf 30 participants, 63.3% completed \u22654/8 modules and 43.3% completed \u22656/8 modules. Mean CSQ-8 and uMARS scores were 27.2 (SD 4.5) and 4.0 (SD 0.7), respectively, supporting high satisfaction. Statistically and clinically significant improvements were observed in PHQ-9 (mean change -4.4; Cohen's d = 0.92), GAD-7 (-2.8; d = 0.63), and Skindex-16 symptoms (5.0; d = 0.78), emotions (10.0; d = 0.95), and functioning (6.4; Cohen's d = 0.71) subscales as well as the Psoriasis Symptom Inventory (3.1; d = 0.43).\nThis study supports the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of smartphone-delivered CBT for individuals with psoriasis and depressive symptoms. Given the scalability of this model, future randomized trials are warranted to assess broader effectiveness in dermatology care settings.",

Patients were implanted and followed up with the Vercise DBS system from May 2013 to December 2022. Eligibility required diagnosis of bilateral idiopathic PD with more than 5 years of motor symptoms, more than 6 hours per day of poor motor function, modified Hoehn and Yahr Scale scores higher than 2, Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS-III) score of 30 or higher (medication-off state), and 33% or higher improvement in UPDRS-III medication-on score.\nBilateral STN-DBS for moderate to advanced PD.\nPrimary outcomes included changes in UPDRS and dyskinesia scores, quality-of-life measures, and safety assessments. Exploratory analyses included medication reduction and DBS association with motor signs.\nA total of 313 patients were enrolled with 191 receiving the DBS system, and 137 participants (72%) completed the study. The study population had a mean (SD) age of 60 (7.9) years, with 139 (73%) male participants. Motor function without medication as measured by UPDRS-III improved from a mean (SD) of 42.8 (9.4) to 21.1 (10.6) at year 1 (51%; 95% CI, 49%-53%; P\u2009<\u2009.001) and 27.6 (11.6) at year 5 (36%; 95% CI, 33%-38%; P\u2009<\u2009.001).

The levodopa equivalent dose was reduced by 28% at year 1, remaining stable at year 5 (28%; 95% CI, 26%-31%; P\u2009<\u2009.001). The most common serious adverse event was infection (9 participants). Ten deaths were reported, none related to the study.\nAlthough STN-DBS outcomes declined slightly, possibly due to the progressive nature of the disease, patients with PD sustained significant improvement in motor and activities of daily living scores, along with a stable reduction in anti-parkinsonian medication over the 5-year follow-up period.",

        "abstract": "Tourette syndrome (TS) is a neuropsychiatric disorder that typically manifests in childhood. Currently, anti-psychotic drugs that aim to reduce dopaminergic hyperinnervation in the brain are recommended for TS. These drugs have been proven to increase the risk of extrapyramidal symptoms, which hinder their use. Gut microbiota has been shown to modulate dopamine (Da) metabolism along gut-brain axis and be relevant to the development of TS, and which may be a novel strategy for TS therapy. Xiao-Er-An-Shen Granule (XEASG) is a clinically prescribed herbal mixture that has demonstrated clinical efficacy in treating TS. The detailed mechanism of XEASG in alleviating TS symptoms through the gut-brain axis however remains incompletely understood.\nThis study aimed to investigate the effect of XEASG on TS through regulating Da synthesis both in the brain and gut microbiota.\nXEASG at doses of 2 and 4 g/kg/d was administered orally to 3,3'-iminodipropionitrile (IDPN)-induced TS model mice. Behavioral assessments, targeted metabolomics analysis, 16S rRNA sequencing and enzyme-linkedimmunosorbent assay (ELISA) were employed to elucidate the therapeutic effects and mechanisms of XEASG for TS treatment.\nData showed that XEASG treatment significantly alleviated IDPN-induced tic-like behavior in mice. XEASG significantly reduced Da level in the brain tissues of TS mice, resulting from down-regulated Da synthesis but up-regulated Da degradation. Aberrant Da metabolism was also found in serum and colon contents of TS mice, which was restored by XEASG treatment. Furthermore,16S rRNA sequence revealed that XEASG altered the microbial community composition. Finally, experimental validation confirmed that XEASG suppressed Da synthesis pathway by reducing tyrosine hydroxylase level in the gut microbiota.\nOur findings reveal that XEASG alleviates TS via inhibiting Da synthesis in the brain and gut, which suggests that the regulation of Da through gut microbiota by XEASG could be a therapeutic strategy for TS treatment.",

        "abstract": "Adolescence is frequently called the second brain maturation period. In Tourette disorder (TD), the clinical trajectory of tics and associated psychiatric co-morbidities vary significantly across individuals during the transition from adolescents to adulthood. In this study, we aimed to identify patterns of resting-state functional connectivity that differentiate adolescents with TD from their neurotypical peers, and to monitor symptom-specific functional changes over time. We employed multivariate analysis based on support vector machine (SVM) to predict patterns of resting-state functional connectivity in 64 adolescents with TD and 61 sex- and age-matched healthy controls (HC). 57 TD patients participated twice, at a time interval of 15 months. Based on the results of the multivariate analysis, we implemented a general linear model testing within-group differences in resting-state functional connectivity over time, as well as their correlation with changes in severity of tics, depressive, obsessive-compulsive (OCD) and attention deficit and hyperactivity (ADHD) symptoms. SVM significantly discriminated TD from HC with above-chance accuracy, specificity and sensitivity. The most discriminative connections were prefrontal, striatal and cerebellar networks. Between the visits, adolescents with TD showed decreased functional connectivity between the vermis 3 and the bilateral supplementary motor area, and between the vermis 4,5 and the occipital cortex. The correlation analysis evidenced that (i) an improvement between the visits in the severity of tics was associated with increased connectivity between the pre-supplementary motor cortex, anterior cingulate and inferior frontal gyrus; (ii) an improvement of ADHD was associated with decreased connectivity of the anterior cingulate cortex with the inferior temporal cortex; (iii) an improvement of OCD correlated with decreased cerebellar (lobule 8 and vermis 8, 9) connectivity with fronto-polar, superior temporal and superior frontal cortices, and increased cerebello-parietal connectivity, as well as fronto-parietal and fronto-frontal connectivity; and (iv) an improvement of depressive symptoms correlated with decreased connectivity of the cerebellum (lobule 4, 5 and vermis 6) with the precuneus. Our findings support pathophysiological models of TD in which aberrant patterns of functional connectivity are related to specific comorbidities, that may evolve differently throughout adolescence. Resting-state functional connectivity may provide unique endophenotypes with developmental changes potentially linked to the modification of severity of comorbid conditions. Distinct regions of the cerebellum and its connectivity with various frontal cortical regions emerge as candidate biomarkers to monitor, and possibly predict, the clinical trajectory of TD symptoms, offering insights into disorder pathogenesis and likely guide clinical decision-making.",

This is particularly important in relation to activities being necessary for daily life such as driving a car.\nWe present the case of a 28-year-old male with TS and comorbid attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) who was medicated by his treating physician with an extremely high dose of inhaled medicinal cannabis (MC) of up to 10 g/d. We were interested in the effects of MC on patient's fitness to drive as well as corresponding serum levels of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and its metabolites. Therefore, clinical assessments and computer-based tests (Vienna Test System) were performed at different time points at two consecutive days before and after intake of MC at a dose that was determined by the patient according to clinical need. On day 1, he inhaled a total dose of 3.3\u00a0g and 4.1\u00a0g MC, respectively, before driving tests were performed. Until the end of the day, he used a total dose of 8.8\u00a0g. On day 2, he took no MC before all tests were completed. Remarkably, according to the German Federal Highway Research Institute guidelines, the patient was considered fit to drive in all domains assessed at all time points at day 1 and 2. Higher doses of MC - and corresponding very high THC serum levels - resulted in best results with respect to patient's driving ability. THC serum levels ranged from 19 ng/ml (at day 2 without MC intake at this day) to 364 ng/ml (at day 1 after intake of a total of 3.3\u00a0g MC at the same day). No clinically relevant side effects occurred.\nThis case study demonstrates that patients with TS plus comorbid ADHD may be fit to drive even after intake of high doses of MC. In any case, however, every driver, who uses MC, is obliged to check fitness to drive before driving a vehicle.",

The intricate comorbidity of ADHD with depression, Tourette syndrome (TS), and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) presents substantial challenges in the screening, diagnosis, and management of these conditions. The aim of this study was to utilize big data-derived brain charts as an objective standard to assess brain development, comparing regional brain development differences between children with pure ADHD and those with comorbidities, and to explore the presumed correlation between specific structural deviations and the severity of ADHD symptoms.\nThis is a large, population-based cross-sectional study with an observational design that prospectively enrolled 459 children with ADHD, using big data-derived brain charts as an objective standard for assessing brain development. Through normative brain chart modeling, we investigated regional brain development disparities between children with pure ADHD and those with comorbidities, exploring the associations between structural deviations and clinical symptoms.\nSignificant intergroup differences were observed in cortical thickness in the left cuneus gyrus (\nBrain charts effectively unveil structural variations in ADHD and comorbid groups, aiding in the prediction of inattention severity. These insights advance our understanding of ADHD's neurobiology and pave the way for personalized diagnostics and therapies.",

        "abstract": "Evaluation of movement disorders primarily relies on phenomenology. Despite refinements in diagnostic criteria, the accuracy remains suboptimal. Such a gap may be bridged by machine learning and video technology, which permit objective, quantitative, non-invasive motor analysis. Markerless automated video-analysis, namely Computer Vision, emerged as best suited for ecologically-valid assessment.\nTo systematically review the application of Computer Vision for assessment, diagnosis, and monitoring of movement disorders.\nFollowing the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines, we searched Cochrane, Embase, PubMed, and Scopus databases for articles published between 1984 and September 2024. We used the following search strategy: (\"video analysis\" OR \"computer vision\") AND (\"Parkinson's disease\" OR \"PD\" OR \"tremor\" OR \"dystonia\" OR \"parkinsonism\" OR \"progressive supranuclear palsy\" OR \"PSP\" OR \"multiple system atrophy\" OR \"MSA\" OR \"corticobasal syndrome\" OR \"CBS\" OR \"chorea\" OR \"ballism\" OR \"myoclonus\" OR \"Tourette's syndrome\").\nOut of 1099 identified studies, 61 met inclusion criteria, and 10 additional studies were included based on authors' judgment. Parkinson's disease was the most investigated movement disorder, with gait as the prevalent motor task. OpenPose was the most used pose estimation software. Automated video-analysis consistently achieved diagnostic accuracies exceeding 80% across most movement disorders. For tremor, dystonia severity and tic detection, Computer Vision strongly aligned with accelerometery and clinical assessments.\nComputer Vision holds potential to provide non-invasive quantification of presence and severity of movement disorders. Heterogeneity in video settings, software usage, and definition of standardized guidelines for videorecording are challenges to be addressed for real-word applications.",

        "abstract": "Tourette disorder (TS) is characterized by motor hyperactivity and tics that are believed to originate in the basal ganglia. Postmortem immunocytochemical analyses has revealed decreases in cholinergic (CH), as well as parvalbumin and somatostatin GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid) interneurons (INs) within the caudate/putamen of individuals with TS.\nWe obtained transcriptome and open chromatin datasets by single-nucleus RNA sequencing and single-nucleus ATAC sequencing, respectively, from caudate/putamen postmortem specimens of 6 adults with TS and 6 matched normal control subjects. Differential gene expression and differential chromatin accessibility analyses were performed in identified cell types.\nThe data reproduced the known cellular composition of the human striatum, including a majority of medium spiny neurons (MSNs) and small populations of GABA-INs and CH-INs. INs were decreased by \u223c50% in TS brains, with no difference in other cell types. Differential gene expression analysis suggested that mitochondrial oxidative metabolism in MSNs and synaptic adhesion and function in INs were both decreased in subjects with TS, while there was activation of immune response in microglia. Gene expression changes correlated with changes in activity of cis-regulatory elements, suggesting a relationship of transcriptomic and regulatory abnormalities in MSNs, oligodendrocytes, and astrocytes of TS brains.\nThis initial analysis of the TS basal ganglia transcriptome at the single-cell level confirms the loss and synaptic dysfunction of basal ganglia INs, consistent with in vivo basal ganglia hyperactivity. In parallel, oxidative metabolism was decreased in MSNs and correlated with activation of microglia cells, which is attributable at least in part to dysregulated activity of putative enhancers, implicating altered epigenomic regulation in TS.",

This review highlights how miRNA dysregulation can illuminate the molecular pathways of these diseases and potentially serve as biomarkers for early diagnosis and prognosis. Specifically, miRNAs' ability to target genes critical to the pathology of neurodegenerative diseases, their role in the development of trinucleotide repeat and neurodevelopmental disorders, and their distinctive patterns in SCZ and mood disorders are discussed. The review also stresses the value of miRNAs in precision neuropsychiatry, where they could predict treatment outcomes and aid in disease management. Furthermore, the study of conserved miRNAs in model organisms like Drosophila underscores their broad utility and provides deeper mechanistic insights into their biological functions. This comprehensive examination of miRNAs across various conditions advocates for their integration into clinical practice, promising advancements in personalized healthcare for neurological and psychiatric conditions.",

        "abstract": "The need for new therapeutics for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is evident. Brain, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and plasma protein biomarkers with causal genetic evidence could represent potential drug targets. However, a comprehensive screen of the proteome has not yet been conducted.\nWe employed a three-pronged approach using Mendelian Randomization (MR) and Bayesian colocalization analysis. Firstly, we studied 608 brains, 214 CSF, and 612 plasma proteins as potential causal mediators of ADHD using MR analysis. Secondly, we analysed the consistency of the discovered biomarkers across three distinct subtypes of ADHD: childhood, persistent, and late-diagnosed ADHD. Finally, we extended our analysis to examine the correlation between identified biomarkers and Tourette syndrome and pervasive autism spectrum disorder (ASD), conditions often linked with ADHD. To validate the MR findings, we conducted sensitivity analysis. Additionally, we performed cell type analysis on the human brain to identify risk genes that are notably enriched in various brain cell types.\nAfter applying Bonferroni correction, we found that the risk of ADHD was increased by brain proteins GMPPB, NAA80, HYI, CISD2, and HYI, TIE1 in CSF and plasma. Proteins GMPPB, NAA80, ICA1L, CISD2, TIE1, and RMDN1 showed overlapped loci with ADHD risk through Bayesian colocalization. Overexpression of GMPPB protein was linked to an increase in the risk for all three ADHD subtypes. While ICA1L provided protection against both ASD and ADHD, CISD2 increased the probability of both disorders. Cell-specific studies revealed that GMPPB, NAA80, ICA1L, and CISD2 were predominantly present on the surface of excitatory-inhibitory neurons.\nOur comprehensive MR investigation of the brain, CSF, and plasma proteomes revealed seven proteins with causal connections to ADHD. Particularly, GMPPB and TIE1 emerged as intriguing targets for potential ADHD therapy.\nThis work was partly funded by the Key R & D Program of Zhejiang (T.L. 2022C03096); the National Natural Science Foundation of China Project (C.Z. 82001413); Postdoctoral Foundation of West China Hospital (C.Z. 2020HXBH163).",

However, patients with tics show no obvious movement imprecision in everyday life. One reason could be that patients have strategies to compensate for noise that disrupts performance (ie, noise that is task-relevant).\nOur goal was to unmask effects of elevated sensorimotor noise on the variability of voluntary movements in patients with PTD.\nWe tested 30 adult patients with PTD (23 male) and 30 matched controls in a reaching task designed to unmask latent noise. Subjects reached to targets whose shape allowed for variability either in movement direction or extent. This enabled us to decompose variability into task-relevant versus less task-relevant components, where the latter should be less affected by compensatory strategies than the former. In alternating blocks, the task-relevant target dimension switched, allowing us to explore the temporal dynamics with which participants adjusted movement variability to changes in task demands.\nBoth groups accurately reached to targets, and adjusted movement precision based on target shape. However, when task-relevant dimensions of the target changed, patients initially produced movements that were more variable than controls, before regaining precision after several reaches. This effect persisted across repeated changes in the task-relevant dimension across the experiment, and therefore did not reflect an effect of\u00a0novelty, or differences in learning.\nOur results suggest that patients with PTD generate noisier voluntary movements compared with controls, but rapidly compensate according to current task demands. \u00a9 2024 The Authors.

We also discuss developments in gene therapy for aromatic l-amino acid decarboxylase deficiency and hereditary spastic paraplegia, as well as current work exploring optimization of deep brain stimulation and lesioning with focused ultrasound.\nChildhood-onset movement disorders have traditionally been treated symptomatically based on phenomenology, but focus has recently shifted toward targeted molecular mechanism-based therapeutics. The development of precision therapies is driven by increasing capabilities for genetic testing and a better delineation of the underlying disease mechanisms. We highlight novel and exciting approaches to the treatment of genetic childhood-onset movement disorders while also discussing general challenges in therapy development for rare diseases. We provide a framework for molecular mechanism-based treatment approaches, a summary of specific treatments for various movement disorders, and a clinical trial readiness framework.",

He presented his research recently published in Nature inn a collaboration with Dr. Evan Gordon to identify and characterize the somato-cognitive action network (SCAN), which has redefined the motor homunculus and has led to new hypotheses about the integrative networks underpinning therapeutic DBS. The DBS Think Tank was founded in 2012 and provides an open platform where clinicians, engineers, and researchers (from industry and academia) can freely discuss current and emerging DBS technologies, as well as logistical and ethical issues facing the field. The group estimated that globally more than 263,000 DBS devices have been implanted for neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders. This year's meeting was focused on advances in the following areas: cutting-edge translational neuromodulation, cutting-edge physiology, advances in neuromodulation from Europe and Asia, neuroethical dilemmas, artificial intelligence and computational modeling, time scales in DBS for mood disorders, and advances in future neuromodulation devices.",

By analyzing which connections were modulated for optimal therapeutic response across these disorders, we segregated the frontal cortex into circuits that had become dysfunctional in each of them. Dysfunctional circuits were topographically arranged from occipital to frontal, ranging from interconnections with sensorimotor cortices in dystonia, the primary motor cortex in Tourette's syndrome, the supplementary motor area in Parkinson's disease, to ventromedial prefrontal and anterior cingulate cortices in obsessive-compulsive disorder.

However, the efficacy and safety of SGAs for treating other mental disorders is unclear. A systematic literature search for randomized, placebo-controlled trials of 11 SGAs for treating 18 mental disorders apart from schizophrenia were carried out from database inception to April 3, 2022. The primary outcome was the mean change in the total score for different mental disorders. The secondary outcome was the odds ratio (OR) of response, remission rates and risk ratio (RR) of adverse events (AEs). A total of 181 studies (N\u00a0=\u00a065,480) were included. All SGAs showed significant effects in treating other mental disorders compared with placebo, except autistic disorder and dementia. Aripiprazole is the most effective treatment for bipolar mania [effect size\u00a0=\u00a0-0.90, 95% CI: -1.59, -0.21] and Tourette's disorder [effect size\u00a0=\u00a0-0.80, 95% CI: -1.14, -0.45], olanzapine for bipolar depression [effect size\u00a0=\u00a0-0.86, 95% CI: -1.32, -0.39] and post-traumatic stress disorder [effect size\u00a0=\u00a0-0.98, 95% CI: -1.55, -0.41], lurasidone for depression [effect size\u00a0=\u00a0-0.66, 95% CI: -0.82, -0.50], quetiapine for anxiety [effect size\u00a0=\u00a0-1.20, 95% CI: -1.96, -0.43], sleep disorders [effect size\u00a0=\u00a0-1.2, 95% CI: -1.97, -0.58], and delirium [effect size\u00a0=\u00a0-0.36, 95% CI: -0.70, -0.03], and risperidone for obsessive-compulsive disorder [effect size\u00a0=\u00a0-2.37, 95% CI: -3.25, -1.49], respectively. For safety, AE items for each SGAs was different. Interestingly, we found that some AEs of OLZ, QTP, RIS and PALI have significant palliative effects on some symptoms. Significant differences in the efficacy and safety of different SGAs for treatment of other mental disorders should be considered for choosing the drug and for the balance between efficacy and tolerability for the specific patient.",

Here, we take advantage of informative recombinations in simplex ASD families to pinpoint risk-enriched regions on Chr X, within which rare maternally-inherited damaging variants carry substantial risk in males with ASD. We then apply a modified transmission disequilibrium test to 13,052 ASD probands and identify a novel high confidence ASD risk gene at exome-wide significance (MAGEC3). Finally, we observe that rare damaging variants within these risk regions carry similar effect sizes in males with TS or ADHD, further clarifying genetic mechanisms underlying male vulnerability in multiple neurodevelopmental disorders that can be exploited for systematic gene discovery.",

We examined behavior in the Balloon Analogue Risk Task (BART), which tests risky decision-making, in two independent samples of European ancestry. One sample (n\u2009=\u20091138) comprised healthy participants and some psychiatric patients (53 schizophrenia, 42 bipolar disorder, 47 ADHD); the other (n\u2009=\u2009911) excluded for recent treatment of various psychiatric disorders but not ADHD. Participants provided DNA and performed the BART, indexed by mean adjusted pumps. We constructed a polygenic risk score (PRS) for discovery in each dataset and tested it in the other as replication. Subsequently, a genome-wide MEGA-analysis, combining both samples, tested genetic correlation with risk-taking self-report in the UK Biobank sample and psychiatric phenotypes characterized by risk-taking (ADHD, Bipolar Disorder, Alcohol Use Disorder, prior cannabis use) in the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium. The PRS for BART performance in one dataset predicted task performance in the replication sample (r\u2009=\u20090.13, p\u2009=\u20090.000012, pFDR\u2009=\u20090.000052), as did the reciprocal analysis (r\u2009=\u20090.09, p\u2009=\u20090.0083, pFDR=0.04).

        "doi": "10.1007/s00406-023-01603-z",
        "abstract": "Since 2019, a global increase in patients presenting with functional Tourette-like behaviors (FTB) has been observed. This has been related to the exposure of tic-related content in social media, although other factors seem to further fuel this phenomenon. Recently, we, therefore, proposed the term mass social media-induced illness (MSMI) as, in our opinion, this phenomenon constitutes a new type of mass sociogenic illness (MSI) that is in contrast to all recent outbreaks spread solely via social media. In accordance with this hypothesis, we were able to identify the host of the German YouTube channel \"Gewitter im Kopf\" (\"Thunderstorm in the brain\") as the initial virtual index case. The purpose of this paper is to present clinical characteristics of a sample of 32 patients diagnosed with MSMI-FTB compared to a large sample of patients with Tourette syndrome (TS) and other chronic tic disorders (CTD) (n\u2009=\u20091032) from the same center in Germany indicating clinical factors helpful to distinguish between tics in TS/CTD and MSMI-FTB. Our main findings were: in patients with MSMI-FTB compared to those with TS/CTD we found (i) a significantly higher age at onset, (ii) a significantly higher rate of females, (iii) a significantly higher rate of obscene and socially inappropriate symptoms, (iv) a significantly lower rate of comorbid ADHD, and (v) a significantly lower rate of OCD/OCB. In contrast, rates of comorbid anxiety and depression as well as reported frequencies of premonitory urges/sensations and suppressibility of symptoms did not differ between groups.",

This randomized, multicenter, placebo-controlled, phase IIIb study aimed to examine efficacy and safety of the cannabis extract nabiximols in adults with TS/CTD (n\u00a0=\u00a097, randomized 2:1 to nabiximols:placebo). The primary efficacy endpoint was defined as a tic reduction of \u2265 25% according to the Total Tic Score of the Yale Global Tic Severity Scale after 13 weeks of treatment. Although a much larger number of patients in the nabiximols compared to the placebo group (14/64 (21\u00b79%) vs. 3/33 (9\u00b71%)) met the responder criterion, superiority of nabiximols could formally not be demonstrated. In secondary analyses, substantial trends for improvements of tics, depression, and quality of life were observed. Additionally exploratory subgroup analyses revealed an improvement of tics in particular in males, patients with more severe tics, and patients with comorbid attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder suggesting that these subgroups may benefit better from treatment with cannabis-based medication. There were no relevant safety issues. Our data further support the role of cannabinoids in the treatment of patients with chronic tic disorders.",

        "abstract": "A range of factors affect performance on tasks associated with creativity, including stress, pharmacology, behavioral interventions, and neural stimulation strategies. Most of the pharmacological impacts have focused on the dopaminergic and noradrenergic systems. However, some evidence suggests that these systems may differ in their impact on performance on divergent and convergent tasks. We performed a systematic PubMed review examining the results for 'creativity and (dopamine or dopaminergic)' and 'creativity and (norepinephrine or noradrenergic or adrenergic)'. The dopaminergic search yielded 238 articles. The noradrenergic search yielded 102 articles. The articles were screened for actually targeting these systems (for example, by pharmacological intervention or by examining genetics relevant to these systems) and examining performance on divergent or convergent tasks. Results of the review of the qualifying articles lent some support to an impact of the dopaminergic system on divergent task performance, and suggested an impact of the noradrenergic system on convergent task performance, but often required additional factors such as stress to reveal robust effects. This review suggests a differential impact of the dopaminergic system and noradrenergic system on divergent and convergent task performance, but studies to systematically address this question across conditions are lacking, and would be needed going forward.",

        "abstract": "Advancements over the past decade in understanding vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2) inhibitors highlight their key role in the treatment of movement and neuropsychiatric disorders. VMAT2 is crucial for packaging neurotransmitters such as serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine into synaptic vesicles, facilitating their release and reuptake in synaptic transmission. VMAT2 inhibitors, such as tetrabenazine, deutetrabenazine, and valbenazine, show therapeutic efficacy in managing hyperkinetic movement disorders, including Huntington's disease, tardive dyskinesia, and Tourette's syndrome. These inhibitors modulate excessive synaptic activity by reducing neurotransmitter storage and release. Genetic variations, particularly in the cytochrome P450 enzyme family, influence VMAT2 inhibitor metabolism, necessitating personalised dosing to optimise efficacy and minimise adverse events. Recent studies have provided further structural insights into VMAT2 inhibition mechanisms, paving the way for the development of inhibitors with enhanced potency and selectivity. Leveraging pharmacogenetics for precision medicine and exploring VMAT2 inhibition in broader therapeutic contexts could revolutionise treatment frameworks for neurological and psychiatric conditions.",

        "abstract": "To investigate the effects of acupuncture on the neurotransmitter levels and gut microbiota in a mouse model of Tourette syndrome (TS).\nThirty-six male C57/BL6 mice were randomly divided into 4 groups using a random number table method: 3,3'-iminodipropionitrile (IDPN) group, control group, acupuncture group, and tiapride group, with 9 mice in each group. In the IDPN group, acupuncture group, and tiapride group, mice received daily intraperitoneal injections of IDPN (300 mg/kg body weight) for 7 consecutive days to induce stereotyped behaviors. Subsequently, in the acupuncture intervention group, standardized acupuncture treatment was administered for 14 consecutive days to IDPN-induced TS model mice. The selected acupoints included Baihui (DU 20), Yintang (DU 29), Waiguan (SJ 5), and Zulinqi (GB 41). In the tiapride group, mice were administered tiapride (50 mg/kg body weight) via oral gavage daily for 14 consecutive days. The control group, IDPN group, and acupuncture group received the same volume of saline orally for 14 consecutive days. Stereotypic behaviors were quantified through behavioral assessments. Neurotransmitter levels, including dopamine (DA), glutamate (Glu), and aspartate (ASP) in striatal tissue were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Dopamine transporter (DAT) expression levels were additionally quantified through quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Gut microbial composition was analyzed through 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing, while metabolic profiling was conducted using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS).\nAcupuncture administration significantly attenuated stereotypic behaviors, concurrently reducing striatal levels of DA, Glu and ASP concentrations while upregulating DAT expression compared with untreated TS controls (P<0.05 or P<0.01). Comparative analysis identified significant differences in Muribaculaceae (P=0.001), Oscillospiraceae (P=0.049), Desulfovibrionaceae (P=0.001), and Marinifilaceae (P=0.014) following acupuncture intervention. Metabolomic profiling revealed alterations in 7 metabolites and 18 metabolic pathways when compared to the TS mice, which involved various amino acid metabolisms associated with DA, Glu, and ASP.\nAcupuncture demonstrates significant modulatory effects on both central neurotransmitter systems and gut microbial ecology, thereby highlighting its dual therapeutic potential for TS management through gut-brain axis regulation.",

        "doi": "10.1523/JNEUROSCI.2182-24.2025",
        "abstract": "Dopamine modulation of the basal ganglia differs in males and females and is implicated in numerous neuropsychiatric conditions, including some, like Tourette syndrome (TS) and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), that have marked sex differences in prevalence. Genetic studies in TS and subsequent work in animals suggest that a loss of histamine may contribute to dysregulation of dopamine. Motivated by this, we characterized the modulation of striatal dopamine by histamine, using microdialysis, targeted pharmacology, and shRNA knockdown of histamine receptors. Intracerebroventricular (ICV) histamine reduced striatal dopamine in male mice, replicating previous work. In contrast, and unexpectedly, ICV histamine increased striatal dopamine in females. ICV or targeted infusion of agonists revealed that the effect in males depends on H2R receptors in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc). Knockdown of H2R in SNc GABAergic neurons abrogated the effect, identifying these cells as a key locus of histamine's regulation of dopamine in males. In females, however, H2R had no discernible role; instead, H3R agonists in the striatum increased striatal dopamine. Strikingly, the effect of histamine on dopamine in females was modulated by the estrous cycle, appearing only in proestrus, when estrogen levels are high, and estrus. These findings confirm the regulation of striatal dopamine by histamine but identify marked sex differences in and estrous modulation of this effect. These findings may shed light on the mechanistic underpinnings of sex differences in the striatal circuitry and in several neuropsychiatric conditions.",

        "abstract": "The coexistence of tics with Parkinson's disease (PD) is rare, as they often emerge at different ages, follow different trajectories and involve contrasting pathophysiological mechanisms related to dopamine availability and function in the brain.\nWe present 10 individuals with primary tic disorders who later developed PD. Tic severity remained unchanged with the onset of parkinsonism or dopaminergic treatment. Peak-dose dyskinesias in two cases did not affect tics, and deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus transiently induced tics in one individual with PD.\nThe evidence drawn from this case series does not support a linear relation between nigrostriatal dopaminergic availability and tics. It suggests that tics may instead arise from a more complex interplay between multiple neurotransmitter systems acting on several networks within the cortico-striatal-thalamic circuits.",

        "abstract": "Although deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus (STN-DBS) induces motor benefits in people with Parkinson's disease (PwPD), its effect on motor axial symptoms (e.g., postural instability, trunk posture alterations) and gait impairments (e.g., freezing of gait) is still ambiguous. Physical therapy (PT) effectively complements pharmacological treatment to improve postural stability, gait performance, and other dopamine-resistant symptoms (e.g. freezing of gait) in the general population with PD. Despite the positive potential of combined PT and STN-DBS surgery, scientific results are still lacking. We therefore involved worldwide leading experts on DBS and motor rehabilitation in PwPD in a consensus Delphi panel to define the current level of PT recommendation following STN-DBS surgery.\nAfter summarizing the few available findings through a systematic scoping review, we identified clinically and academically experienced DBS clinicians (n\u2009=\u200921) to discuss the challenges related to PT following STN-DBS. A 5-point Likert scale questionnaire was used and based on the results of the systematic review, thirty-nine questions were designed and submitted to the panel-half related to general considerations on PT following STN-DBS, and half related to PT treatments.\nDespite the low-to-moderate quality of data, the few available rehabilitation studies suggested that PT could improve dynamic and static balance, gait performance and posture in the population with PD receiving STN-DBS. Similarly, the panellists strongly agreed that PT might help improve motor symptoms and quality of life, and it may be prescribed to maximize the effects of stimulation. The experts agreed that physical therapists could be part of the multidisciplinary team taking care of the patients. Also, they agreed that conventional PT, but not massage or manual therapy, should be prescribed because of the specificity of STN-DBS implantation.\nAlthough RCT evidence is lacking, upon Delphi panel, PT for PwPD receiving STN-DBS can be potentially useful to maximize clinical improvement. However, more research is needed, with RCTs and well-designed studies. The rehabilitation and DBS community should expand this area of research to create guidelines for PT following STN-DBS.",

        "abstract": "Tic disorders (TD) refer to a condition where individuals experience recurring motor movements (e.g., eye blinking) and/or vocalizations (e.g., throat clearing). These disorders vary in terms of duration, cause, and manifestation of symptoms. Tourette's syndrome (TS) involves the presence of ongoing motor and vocal tics for a minimum of 1\u202fyear, with fluctuating intensity. Persistent chronic motor or vocal tic disorder is characterized by either motor or vocal tics (not both) present for at least 1\u202fyear. Provisional TD presents with either motor or vocal tics (not both) that have been present for less than 12\u202fmonths. Though medications like Aripiprazole and dopamine receptor blockers are frequently prescribed, their potential unwanted consequences increase, may result in low adherence. In an effort to improve and broaden the care available for children diagnosed with TD, alternative methods such as acupuncture are being investigated and considered. Acupuncture is a method of traditional Chinese medicine that includes the placement of thin needles into particular areas of the body in order to correct any disruptions or irregularities. Research has demonstrated that acupuncture can help regulate abnormal brain function and relieve tic symptoms in individuals with TD. Additional studies are required to fully evaluate the usefulness of complementary treatments in addressing TD in young individuals, despite its common usage. Herein, we summarized the therapeutic effects of acupuncture in the treatment of TD.",

Our analyses confirmed that Celsr3 mutant mice displayed grooming stereotypies and tic-like jerks, as well as sensorimotor gating deficits, which were opposed by TS therapies.

The objectives of this systematic review were to determine the pooled estimate for efficacy [in terms of reduction in tic Yale Global Tic Severity Scale (YGTSS) scores] and safety of oral ecopipam in subjects with TS.\nAll clinical trials that explored the efficacy and/or safety of ecopipam in patients with TS were included to determine the pooled estimate for change in YGTSS, Clinical Global Impression (CGI)-TS, and the severity of comorbid attention-deficit hyperactive disorder (ADHD), obsessive compulsion disorder (OCD), and depressive symptoms, as well as the nature and frequency of adverse effects. Case-series, retrospective studies, and case reports were excluded. Databases, such as PUBMED, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and SCOPUS were searched to identify these trials using suitable combination of MESH terms/keywords on 15 June 2024. ROB 2.0 and ROBINS-I tool were used to assess the risk of bias in included randomized-controlled trials (RCTs) and non-randomized intervention studies, respectively, and the GRADE system to determine the certainty of the collated evidence.\nA total of 96 records were identified in the database search and 31 records were screened after removing duplicates. After excluding 23 irrelevant records, the full-text review included 8 records. Finally, six publications from three completed clinical trials (two RCTs, with one having an open-label extension) and one ongoing clinical trial were included. A total of 251 participants were included. The pooled estimate for mean change in YGTSS-TTS from baseline to the completion of the randomization period was statistically better in the ecopipam group compared with the placebo group [mean difference: - 3.0, 95% (confidence interval (CI) - 4.2 to - 1.9, I\nEcopipam is effective in reducing the\u00a0severity of tics in subjects with TS and has a\u00a0good safety profile.

Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate how RHY alleviates hyperactivity and cognitive flexibility impairment while inhibiting inflammatory responses in mice that partly lack dopamine transporter protein (DAT- mice).\nMale DAT- mice were randomly divided into the RHY group (n = 8) and administered RHY (30\u00a0mg/kg) in the DAT- group (n = 8) and administered saline (i.p., 10\u00a0mL/kg) in wild-type (WT) mice as the WT control group (n = 8). Hyperactivity and cognitive flexibility impairment were evaluated by the open field test (OFT) and the Morris water maze (MWM) test. The levels of the inflammatory factors of tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) and interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2) in cortical homogenates were tested by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) after 8 weeks of treatment with RHY. In vitro, primary microglia and astrocytes extracted from the cortices of DAT- neonatal mice and WT neonatal mice were treated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (1\u00a0mg/mL) to induce neuroinflammatory responses and with RHY (20\u00a0mM) for 48\u00a0h. The levels of the inflammatory factors TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX2) in the culture medium were measured at 6\u00a0h, 24\u00a0h, and 48\u00a0h after treatment with LPS and RHY.\nRHY ameliorated hyperactivity and cognitive flexibility impairment in DAT- mice and inhibited the expression of the inflammatory factors TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, iNOS, and COX-2 in microglia and astrocytes in vitro, and also inhibited the expression of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 in cortical homogenates after 8 weeks of treatment.\nRHY improved hyperactivity and cognitive flexibility impairment through inhibiting inflammatory responses in DAT- mice.",

        "abstract": "Although deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus (STN-DBS) induces motor benefits in people with Parkinson's disease (PwPD), the size and duration of the effects of STN-DBS on motor axial (e.g., postural instability, trunk posture alterations) and gait impairments (e.g., freezing of gait - FOG) are still ambiguous. Physical therapy (PT) effectively complements pharmacological treatment to improve postural stability, gait performance, and other dopamine-resistant symptoms (e.g. festination, hesitation, axial motor dysfunctions, and FOG) in PwPD who are non-surgically treated. Despite the potential for positive adjuvant effects of PT following STN-DBS surgery, there is a paucity of science available on the topic. In such a scenario, gathering the opinion and expertise of leading investigators worldwide was pursued to study motor rehabilitation in PwPD following STN-DBS. After summarizing the few available findings through a systematic review, we identified clinical and academically experienced DBS clinicians (n=21) to discuss the challenges related to PT following STN-DBS. A 5-point Likert scale questionnaire was used and based on the results of the systematic review along with a Delphi method. Thirty-nine questions were submitted to the panel - half related to general considerations on PT following STN-DBS, half related to PT treatments. Despite the low-to-moderate quality, the few available rehabilitative studies suggested that PT could improve dynamic and static balance, gait performance and posture. Similarly, panellists strongly agreed that PT might help in improving motor symptoms and quality of life, and it may be possibly prescribed to maximize the effects of the stimulation. The experts agreed that physical therapists could be part of the multidisciplinary team taking care of the patients. Also, they agreed on prescribing of conventional PT, but not massage or manual therapy. Our results will inform the rehabilitation and the DBS community to engage, publish and deepen this area of research. Such efforts may spark guidelines for PT following STN-DBS.",

He is very active, jumping up and down at circle time, bumping into classmates, and impulsively hitting other children when they take his toys. As a toddler, his cognitive and social-emotional skills were on track, and he received early intervention for language and motor delays. He qualified for an IEP and transitioned to a district-based inclusive preschool setting with speech therapy and adaptive physical education. Marcus spends the week with his grandparents, and they live in a school district that is well-resourced and has inclusive school and therapy settings. The teachers call parents or grandparents frequently to pick him up. In response to misbehavior, they also put him in a separate timeout area, away from the other children, with a 1:1 aide for the rest of the day. On 2 occasions, he was strapped into a therapy chair for nonambulatory children after biting or hitting another child. Because he does well with 1:1 support, the school has switched him to a special day class with smaller class size, comprised primarily of autistic preschoolers who are minimally verbal. Marcus' parents have just started parent training in behavior management for ADHD after struggling to find a therapist that was covered by their insurance. His mother noticed while volunteering in his original class that other children with similar behavior were not sent home or transferred to a special education class. They are upset with the transfer to the more restrictive environment, but they are worried if they speak up that the district will send him to a less resourced school in the district where the family, rather than grandparents, reside. How would you advise the family to proceed?",

        "abstract": "In the last decade, several theories have proposed explanations of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) based on the Bayesian Brain hypothesis. Research on repetition suppression suggests that neural correlates of prediction errors in ASD might be domain specific with larger differences for faces than for objects. Contrastingly, research assessing mismatch negativity in attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) indicates domain-generally modified prediction errors. Therefore, we captured neural correlates of prediction errors to colours and emotions in adults with ADHD or ASD to assess domain specificity of prediction error modifications. We used a multi-feature roving paradigm where we assessed predictive processes regarding unattended, task-irrelevant faces. We extracted task specific precision-weighted prediction errors and prediction strength for emotions and colours of the faces separately using a generative model, specifically a Hierarchical Gaussian Filter. While we found neural correlates of colour precision-weighted prediction errors and prediction strength as well as emotion prediction strength in the pooled sample regardless of group, we did not find any differences in neural correlates of emotion or colour precision-weighted prediction errors or prediction strength between our groups. These results suggest preserved neural correlates of precision-weighted prediction errors in ASD and ADHD for low-level visual features and potentially complex social information.",

We describe the case of a 19-year-old male with a history of autism spectrum disorder, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and morbid obesity, who showed a clinically significant response to tirzepatide therapy following failed conventional interventions. This case highlights the potential role of dual incretin therapy in adolescents with severe early-onset obesity and hyperphagia, even in the absence (based on present knowledge) of identifiable hypothalamic or genetic pathology.",

        "abstract": "Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a clinically heterogeneous neurodevelopmental disorder. Its inattentive presentation (ADHD-I) is a common subtype characterized predominantly by difficulties in sustaining attention, organization skills, and task completion. The biological foundations of ADHD-I remain unclear, hampering the development of effective treatments. This study aimed to identify potential ADHD-I biomarker candidates to guide the therapeutic strategies.\nWe analyzed transcriptome sequencing data from a cohort of 32 children (15 control, 17 ADHD-I; aged 6-12 years;81.2% male). All ADHD-I participants were medication-na\u00efve and without comorbid neurodevelopmental or major psychiatric conditions) to systematically identify potential biomarkers for ADHD-I. Candidate genes were identified by integrating differential expression analysis with weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) modules. High-confidence biomarkers were selected via a multi-step pipeline combining protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis and machine learning feature selection (LASSO regression, Boruta algorithm). Biomarker performance was evaluated using ROC and gene expression analyses, and a predictive nomogram was developed. The ADHD-I molecular landscape was explored through functional enrichment, immune cell profiling, pharmacological screening, and ligand-receptor interaction modeling.\nCluster of Differentiation 180(CD180) and Cytochrome c Oxidase Assembly Factor 3(COA3) were identified as potential ADHD-I biomarker candidates. Both showed high preliminary diagnostic accuracy (AUC > 0.8) and significantly elevated expression in ADHD - I cohorts. The nomogram incorporating these biomarkers showed preliminary predictive accuracy for ADHD-I risk stratification (AUC\u00a0=\u00a00.878) in this cohort. Pathway enrichment analysis further localized CD180 and COA3 to the dorsoventral axis formation pathway, suggesting their role in developmental patterning. Five significant differential immune cell types were identified between ADHD-I and control samples. Both biomarkers demonstrated the significant positive correlation with gamma delta T cells and the strongest negative correlation with eosinophils. Compound prediction showed that 20 compounds such as benzo(a)pyrene targeted CD180, and benzo(a)pyrene had a strong binding ability to CD18 (\u0394G = -8.1 kcal/mol).\nThe study identified CD180 and COA3 as candidate biomarkers for ADHD-I, which may provide new clues into the mechanism of ADHD-I and potential therapeutic targets.",

        "doi": "10.5498/wjp.v15.i10.107123",
        "abstract": "Neurodevelopmental delays encompass a wide range of conditions that impair cognitive, motor, and social functioning, often increasing the risk of psychiatric comorbidities. Children with these delays frequently present with disorders such as attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), anxiety, and behavioral disturbances, which can significantly affect development and quality of life. While genetic predisposition has been linked to these comorbidities, growing evidence highlights the role of environmental factors, including prenatal and early-life stressors. However, the interaction between genetic susceptibility and environmental influences remains poorly understood. Identifying specific genetic variants, environmental risks, and their interactions is essential for early detection and targeted interventions.\nTo investigate the combined effects of genetic and environmental factors on psychiatric comorbidities in children with neurodevelopmental delays, elucidate underlying mechanisms, and inform clinical management strategies.\nThis retrospective cohort study included 80 children with confirmed neurodevelopmental delays and 40 age- and sex-matched typically developing controls. Comprehensive clinical and psychiatric evaluations, genetic testing (chromosomal microarray analysis and targeted next-generation sequencing), and environmental exposure assessments were conducted. Statistical analyses explored associations between genetic variants and psychiatric comorbidities, environmental risk factors, and gene-environment interactions.\nChildren with neurodevelopmental delays exhibited significantly higher rates of psychiatric comorbidities (70.0%) compared to controls (15.0%), with ADHD (42.5%), anxiety disorders (28.8%), and behavioral disorders (23.8%) being the most common. Pathogenic genetic variants were identified in specific pathways associated with distinct psychiatric presentations: Glutamatergic signaling variants were linked to anxiety disorders (odds ratio = 3.8), dopaminergic system variants to ADHD (odds ratio = 4.2), and synaptic function variants to both behavioral and anxiety disorders. Environmental factors, particularly prenatal maternal stress, early childhood adversity, and family dysfunction were strong predictors of psychiatric outcomes (\u03b2 = 0.42). Significant gene-environment interactions were identified, indicating that environmental exposure can moderate the effects of genetic risks on psychiatric outcomes.\nPsychiatric comorbidities in children with neurodevelopmental delays are significantly influenced by both genetic and environmental factors, with complex interactions between the two. These findings underscore the need for integrated assessments and targeted interventions addressing both biological and environmental contributors to improve outcomes in this vulnerable population.",

They analyzed changes in body weight, height, and body mass index (BMI) before and after ADHD treatment, along with the risks of overweight and obesity.\nChildren with ADHD undergoing long-term medication therapy showed decreased actual weight [weighted mean difference (WMD) = -9.50] and height (WMD = -0.15), along with a slight increase in weight standard deviation scores (WMD = 0.23) and height z scores (WMD = 0.10). BMI showed a non-significant downward trend (WMD = -1.72). Regarding overweight and obesity risks, the pooled odds ratios were 1.37 and 1.16, respectively, but these were not statistically significant.\nOverall, the study suggests that long-term pharmacological treatment for ADHD may be associated with reduced growth in weight and height among young patients. However, no clear link was found between ADHD and increased risk of overweight or obesity. These findings highlight the importance of monitoring growth in children receiving medication for ADHD.",

Functional analysis for the 19-miRNA prediction-set revealed involvement in several highly relevant pathways, e.g. dopaminergic synapse, circadian rhythm, and axon guidance.

The current study investigated the relationship between prenatal exposure to maternal cytokines, C-reactive protein (CRP), fever and the risk of ADHD in childhood and early adolescence in the general pediatric population.\nData came from 6,555 mother-child pairs enrolled in Generation R, a Dutch prospective population-based cohort. The primary predictors were 1) self-reported fever and/or infections in each trimester; 2) a composite cytokine index of IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-17a, IL-23, and IFN-\u03b3 and 3) CRP. The primary outcome was ADHD symptoms measured using the Child Behavioral Checklist (parent-reported) and Teacher Report Form (teacher-reported), obtained at three time points (ages 6, 10 and 14\u202fyears). Linear mixed models were used to estimate overall associations, adjusted for maternal factors (i.e., education, national origin, age, current psychopathology, psychosocial stress, smoking, pre-pregnancy BMI, parity) and child factors (i.e., age, sex, polygenic score for neurodevelopmental disorders). We also investigated if the associations were moderated by 1) the child's polygenic score for neurodevelopmental disorders and 2) maternal stress during the pregnancy.\nWe found a small, but significant association between fever and ADHD symptoms (\u00df=0.06 [95\u202f%CI\u202f=\u202f0.01, 0.11]). No significant association was found between the cytokine composite index, individual cytokines, or CRP and ADHD symptoms. No interactions were detected for any of the exposures with a polygenic score for neurodevelopmental disorders (all interactions p-values\u202f>\u202f0.198) or maternal stress (all p-values\u202f>\u202f0.403).\nOur findings suggest that maternal fever and infections during pregnancy are linked to offspring ADHD symptomatology. The standardized effect size was smaller than that of other reported perinatal risk factors for ADHD. Cytokine levels and CRP as markers for chronic inflammation were not associated with ADHD.",

        "abstract": "Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is well-established as a disorder that persists into adulthood and is commonly comorbid with other mental health conditions. Despite increasing numbers of women entering reproductive years with this diagnosis, there is limited research on it in the perinatal period.\nTo critically appraise the available literature and examine the association between maternal ADHD and depression in the perinatal period.\nA systematic review was conducted by searching EMBASE, PsycINFO, MEDLINE and Google Scholar up to August 2024. The available literature was evaluated in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines (PRISMA). The quality assessment was performed using the Joanna Briggs Institute framework, and a narrative synthesis was completed.\nTen studies were identified as meeting the inclusion criteria. The majority were of medium quality, with issues identified in sample size, study design and validity of the self-report scale used. Our review found a prevalence of 16.76% to 57.6% of perinatal depression in women with ADHD. An increased risk of developing perinatal depression was also identified in women with ADHD (OR 1.8-2.63) compared to those without the disorder. Finally, our review also found a positive association between ADHD symptoms and depressive symptoms in perinatal women.\nOur findings suggest a much greater vulnerability to perinatal depression among women with ADHD, and an association between ADHD symptoms and depressive symptoms in the perinatal period. There is, however, a clear need for more high-quality studies to replicate and further explore these findings.",

        "abstract": "Clinical and epidemiological studies have reported a comorbidity between Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and migraine. Pharmacological treatments such as methylphenidate have also been hypothesized to contribute to the onset of headaches. This study aimed to investigate the percentage of headaches in a pediatric ADHD population, comparing children treated with methylphenidate to those not receiving pharmacological therapy, while also considering the potential influence of family history, sex, and age.\nA retrospective cross-sectional analysis was conducted on 118 children and adolescents diagnosed with ADHD (68 treated with methylphenidate, 50 untreated). Headache presence and features were assessed using a structured questionnaire based on international diagnostic criteria. Binomial and multinomial logistic regressions were used to evaluate the effects of methylphenidate use and family history on headache presence and type, controlling for age and sex.\nHeadache symptoms were significantly more frequent in participants with a family history of headache, regardless of medication status. No main effect of methylphenidate on overall headache percentage was observed. However, the combination of methylphenidate treatment and positive family history was significantly associated with migraine-compatible headache presentations. Cephalalgy was not significantly linked to any of the variables. The absence of family history was strongly associated with the absence of headache symptoms.\nFamily history appears to be a key factor in headache percentage among children with ADHD. While methylphenidate alone does not increase headache risk, its interaction with familial predisposition may contribute to migraine-like symptoms. Family history should be carefully considered during clinical assessment.",

        "abstract": "While the need for personalised treatment approaches grows in recognition, predicting treatment outcomes for adults with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) remains underexplored. Recent interest has turned to the brain's surface and its association with treatment response. Although the precise interplay between cortical gyrification and ADHD treatment outcomes remains to be elucidated, preliminary investigations suggest a promising avenue for diagnostic innovation. Expanding upon the Comparison of Methylphenidate and Psychotherapy in Adult ADHD Study (COMPAS), we investigated the prognostic value of cortical gyrification in predicting treatment response. Specifically, we explored how pre-treatment cortical gyrification might predict response to psychotherapy or clinical management in combination with either methylphenidate or placebo following a 12-week intensive treatment period. Cortical gyrification was assessed using 121 T1-weighted anatomical scans. Linear regression models investigated the predictive value of cortical gyrification, regressing baseline cortical structure against post-treatment severity. All brain structural analyses were conducted using the threshold-free cluster enhancement (TFCE) approach and the Computational Anatomy Toolbox (CAT12) within the Statistical Parametric Mapping Software (Matlab Version R2021a). Results revealed significant positive region-specific associations between cortical gyrification and treatment response across three symptom dimensions, with significant associations localised predominantly in frontal regions of the left hemisphere. Our findings emphasise that increased cortical gyrification in frontal cortical regions signifies enhanced treatment efficacy following a 12-week intervention. Further research in this area is imperative to verify the reliability of biological markers in view of treatment success to potentially reduce unnecessary drug-related side-effects, minimising delay from receiving more effective treatments, and increase treatment adherence.",

This study evaluated pupillary light responses (PLR) in subjects with ADHD to assess the integrity of the outer retinal photoreceptor-to-pathway contributions.\nThis cross-sectional study assessed 73 eyes from 43 participants, including 22 with ADHD (mean age\u2009=\u200912.62\u2009\u00b1\u20093.78\u2009years) and 21 controls (mean age\u2009=\u200914.21\u2009\u00b1\u20094.71\u2009years). All participants underwent a comprehensive optometric examination. Monocular PLR was measured using an eye tracker in a Ganzfeld setup with short-wavelength (470\u2009nm) and long-wavelength (640\u2009nm) flashes at intensities of -3, -2, -1 and 1 log cd/m\nThe ADHD group showed reduced PCA for short-wavelength stimulus at -3 log cd/m\nThese findings reveal altered PLR in ADHD, providing evidence of disrupted rod-mediated responses and deficits extending into the rod-cone transition range. The exploratory findings of marked sex-specific differences highlight the need for further investigation and underscore the importance of considering sex as a critical factor in ADHD research. The results suggest a link between cholinergic and noradrenergic dysregulation and altered retinal signal processing.",

        "abstract": "Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder affecting an estimated 5-7% of children and adolescents and 2-5% of adults. However, prevalence rates in published studies vary widely, largely due to methodological differences. High-quality, accurate, prevalence data are essential for clinical decision-making and policymaking. However, these data have not been consistently documented in previous meta-analyses and systematic reviews.\nTo assess the methodological quality of studies reporting ADHD prevalence using the relevant critical appraisal tool.\nOur previously published systematic review identified 103 studies reporting clinically confirmed ADHD prevalence. The studies were grouped by type and age of subjects, and 101 studies were evaluated for risk of bias using an adapted Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) critical appraisal tool modelled on the Cochrane Risk of Bias-2 (RoB2) method.\nThe Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) critical appraisal tool was found to be the most suitable for evaluating prevalence studies. Of the studies reviewed, 62 (61.4%) were at high risk of bias, and only seven (6.9%) had a low risk. Although one- and two-stage clinical study designs are of a higher quality, they are still often highly susceptible to bias.\nThe methodological quality of most ADHD prevalence studies is low. Systematic reviews must include critical appraisal to ensure the reliability of synthesised data. Accurate prevalence estimates are urgently needed in order to improve our understanding of the disease burden and enhance patient management.",

This study evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of the Comprehensive Attention Test (CAT), a computerized tool designed to assess various aspects of attention in children with ADHD, in order to provide the groundwork for clinically applicable interpretation guidelines.\nFactor analysis was performed on the scores of seven CAT subtests (visual and auditory selective attention tasks, sustained attention task, flanker task, divided attention task, and spatial working memory tasks) collected from 5214 subjects aged 4-49 years diagnosed with ADHD at 15 psychiatric clinics in South Korea. Their scores were compared with those of 500 participants with no attention problems.\nCAT subtests were grouped into either three or four factors depending on the age group. Omission error, commission error, and response time variability formed either one or two factors that effectively distinguished ADHD from non-ADHD with high sensitivity and specificity (4-5 years old: areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUROCs] 0.937 and 0.779; 6-8 years old: AUROCs 0.841 and 0.878; 9-18 years old: AUROC 0.864; 19-49 years old: AUROC 0.792). The mean response time and working memory test results formed separate factors. While mean response time was a poor diagnostic indicator of ADHD, it revealed significant differences when psychiatric comorbidities were present.\nCAT results can be categorized into factors reflecting inattentiveness, disinhibition, and working memory. These factors may help diagnose ADHD or detect psychiatric comorbidities.",

Calls often addressed medication management and therapy recommendations for patients with conditions such as anxiety, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, and depression. Consultations were completed on the same day, with one-half of cases managed entirely within the primary care setting. PCPs reported high satisfaction with Be Happy, citing increased confidence in addressing pediatric mental health needs, managing medications, and providing information about therapy resources.\nThe Be Happy program demonstrates the utility of CPAPs in addressing workforce shortages, empowering PCPs, and improving access to mental health care for children and adolescents. Key lessons included the need for targeted outreach to rural areas and the importance of embedding CPAP awareness into health care training programs. Future research should explore patient-level outcomes and strategies to sustain and expand the impact of CPAPs.",

Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (\nPatients with BD\u202f+\u202fADHD demonstrated significant impairments across multiple cognitive domains compared to healthy controls. Regression analyses revealed ADHD severity significantly moderated the relationship between depressive symptoms, and both visual learning performance and overall composite performance. Metabolically, a significant reduction in choline/creatine (Cho/Cr) ratio was observed specifically in the right lentiform nucleus in the BD\u202f+\u202fADHD group, correlating positively with visual learning ability.\nThe findings suggest that BD comorbid with ADHD is characterized by widespread cognitive dysfunction and exhibits a distinct lateralized metabolic abnormality in the basal ganglia, particularly involving the cholinergic system in the right hemisphere, which may constitute the neural substrate underlying cognitive impairments in these patients. Recognizing these comorbidity-specific neurobiological alterations is crucial for refining diagnostic approaches and improving therapeutic outcomes.",

Global prevalence and drug prescription rates are consistently on the rise, particularly in young women. Personal experience in daily psychotherapy practice supports sex differences in how the disorder manifests and how the patients respond to treatment. We review sex differences in therapeutic and adverse responses to the cornerstone ADHD pharmacotherapies methylphenodate and amphetamines, under consideration of preclinical mechanistic insights, clinical studies, and relevance for real-life psychotherapy practice. Overall, many gaps in knowledge remain regarding sex differences on all levels of ADHD disease manifestation, diagnosis, and therapy, and the underlying mechanistic basis.

        "abstract": "When people watch a pre-recorded conversation, they tend to follow the speaker and spend most of the time looking at the faces and eyes of those talking. To test whether these responses reflect realistic social attention, we eye tracked participants in two experiments where the depicted speakers sometimes wore sunglasses which removed fine-grained information from the eye region. We also examined clinically relevant traits which have been shown to have an effect on social attention, by including individuals with high- and low- traits of autism (Experiment 1) and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD; Experiment 2). Those with high levels of autistic traits were less likely to look at key facial features. ADHD symptoms did not have the same effect. When there was a change in speaker, sunglasses disrupted attention such that there were fewer and later looks to the new speaker. Being able to read gaze cues therefore facilitates attention in conversation, and subtle differences in this behaviour may be associated with clinically-relevant traits.",

        "abstract": "In this Personal View, we address key questions to support evidence-based prevention and management of psychotic symptoms that might occur during ADHD pharmacotherapy. We begin by examining evidence showing a significantly increased occurrence of psychotic disorders in individuals with ADHD, independent of ADHD medications (pooled relative risk, odds ratio, or hazard ratio=4\u00b774, 95% CI 4\u00b711-5\u00b746). We then examine whether ADHD medications play a causal role, noting that current evidence does not support such a causal link, at least for methylphenidate. We explore how vulnerability to psychosis varies across individuals with ADHD. Regarding the different steps involved in prescribing ADHD medications, we discuss the importance of balancing potential risks-such as emergence of psychotic symptoms-against the demonstrated benefits of pharmacological treatment for ADHD. Next, we present strategies for screening individuals for vulnerability to psychosis before initiating ADHD medication. We then offer guidance on the clinical management of psychotic symptoms that might arise during ADHD pharmacotherapy, including considerations of dosage and medication type. Finally, we identify key research priorities in this area. Overall, this paper provides an empirical framework, grounded in evidence and clinical practice, to guide the next steps in the field.",

        "abstract": "Board games and gamification - the application of game-like elements to non-game contexts - have emerged as promising strategies in healthcare for enhancing education, promoting behavioral change, and fostering social interaction. While traditionally used for entertainment, these tools are increasingly being investigated as therapeutic and diagnostic interventions across the lifespan. This narrative review synthesizes current evidence on the use of board games in patient education, diagnosis, and treatment among pediatric, adult, elderly, and mixed-age populations. Literature was examined across preventive, diagnostic, and therapeutic domains. The results reveal that in elderly populations, board games have demonstrated potential in maintaining cognitive health, aiding early diagnosis of cognitive impairment, and supporting individuals with mild cognitive decline, as well as increasing physical activity in nursing home residents. In adults, evidence supports benefits in preventive health education (e.g., osteoporosis, palliative care), chronic disease management, psychiatric symptom reduction, and post-surgical rehabilitation. In pediatric populations, board games have been used to improve knowledge and behaviors related to viral disease prevention, nutrition, chronic disease self-management, emotional competency, and pre-operative anxiety, with emerging evidence for attention-deficit hyperactivity disease (ADHD) symptom management. Mixed-age group interventions include risk factor modification for sexually transmitted infections, alcohol and tobacco use reduction. Across studies, board games often enhanced engagement, knowledge retention, motivation, and psychosocial well-being, though effects on long-term clinical outcomes were less consistent. In conclusion. board games represent safe, versatile, and culturally adaptable tools for health promotion, diagnosis, and therapy. While short-term benefits in knowledge, engagement, and psychosocial outcomes are well documented, evidence for sustained clinical impact is limited. Further large-scale, methodologically rigorous studies are warranted to optimize game design for specific health objectives and evaluate long-term efficacy.",

        "abstract": "Microdosing psychedelics has been widely reported to enhance focus and problem-solving, sparking interest in its potential to treat attentional disorders such as ADHD. However, existing studies largely rely on anecdotal evidence and lack adequate placebo control.\nThis study contributes to the literature by examining the longitudinal effects of microdosing psilocybin truffles in two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials conducted in semi-naturalistic settings. We assessed multiple domains, including cognitive control, memory, social cognition, subjective well-being and subjective experiences using mix of quantitative and qualitative methods.\nContrary to expectations, microdosing did not significantly affect behavioral or subjective measures compared to placebo. While some initial effects were observed in social cognition, mood, and self-reported cognitive flexibility, these did not remain significant after correcting for multiple comparisons. Regardless of condition, participants predominantly reported their subjective experiences as positive yet negative bodily feelings were enhanced in the active condition. Notably, participants remained effectively blinded throughout the trials.\nIn conclusion, our findings do not support the idea that microdosing psilocybin reliably enhances cognitive or emotional functioning beyond placebo. Future research should explore individual differences in response to microdosing and examine whether specific populations might benefit from targeted microdosing interventions.",

Using Cox proportional hazard regressions, we estimated the associations between clinically diagnosed ADHD and official crime records within individuals and families.\nAnalyses showed that individuals with ADHD had a significantly higher risk of being convicted of any crime-violent or non-violent-compared to those without ADHD, with the risk being significantly higher for women than men. Additionally, individuals with a relative diagnosed with ADHD were at increased risk of criminal convictions, with some gender-based variations.\nADHD and criminal convictions co-aggregate within families, consistent with shared familial liability. Patterns across relatives and sexes suggest genetic contributions, with stronger associations in women. These findings may help inform risk assessment and prevention efforts.",

        "abstract": "Sequence variation in mitochondrial DNA was once considered neutral, but growing evidence indicates it can influence metabolic, physiological and life-history traits. Two hypotheses offer explanations for this non-neutral mtDNA variation: the mitochondrial climatic adaptation hypothesis, which posits that natural selection shapes mtDNA variation to match local environments, and the mother's curse hypothesis, which predicts the accumulation of male-harming variants due to maternal inheritance. We explored these hypotheses using genetic strains of Drosophila melanogaster bearing eight mtDNA haplotypes-nested within two distinct haplogroups (A1 and B1) that segregate along an Australian latitudinal cline. We measured the longevity of flies under cool (18\u202f\u00b0C) and warm (28\u202f\u00b0C) conditions, predicting that the A1 haplogroup-which has been reported to predominate at subtropical latitudes-would confer higher longevity in warm but reduced longevity in cool temperatures relative to the B1 counterpart. We also tested whether effects of mtDNA haplotype on longevity were larger in males, as predicted under the mother's curse hypothesis. We found mtDNA haplogroup and haplotype is associated with longevity, with the magnitude of effects varying with temperature, but not in a pattern consistent with either hypothesis. Haplogroup-by-environment interactions did not align with reported spatial distributions of the haplogroups, and haplotype effects on longevity were similar across sexes. Our findings add to the growing evidence that mtDNA variation contributes to thermal plasticity in longevity, but do not provide clear insight into whether this variation is adaptive or maladaptive.",

        "abstract": "The microdiscectomy procedure has been regarded as the preferred method for the treatment of lumbar disc herniation (LDH). Intraoperatively, the procedure may be further complicated due to underlying anatomical variations in the lumbar spine or nerve root variations. Nerve root anomalies (NRAs), in particular, are relatively underdiscussed within the literature.\u00a0Despite the rarity of these variations to the exiting nerve root, the increased surgical risk that an NRA may add warrants the need for increased awareness and associated complication mitigation. This case describes a rare instance of a symptomatic duplicate L5 nerve root discovered preoperatively and highlights the steps taken to minimize iatrogenic risk. This study is designed as a retrospective case report with formal informed consent provided by the patient. A thorough chart review was performed for this subject, including all prior medical records, imaging studies, imaging reports, operative notes, and communication records. This patient's preoperative lumbar MRI demonstrated severe left foraminal narrowing at L5-S1 with disc encroachment upon the exiting L5 nerve root and traversing S1 nerve root. The patient was described as having a type 1a NRA. Meticulous consideration was made intraoperatively with no known sustained iatrogenic injury. Preoperative awareness of NRAs, careful dissection, and thorough intraoperative visualization of neural structures are paramount to minimizing the risks of surgical complications. Surgeons should be aware of NRA classification systems and have a surgical plan in place to mitigate risk. Improved awareness may increase the likelihood of preoperative diagnosis and prevent iatrogenic injury.",

This study assesses and compares the optical quality of two phakic IOLs - a diffractive IPCL (Care Group) with +2.5D added power and a refractive Artiplus (Ophtec) - in a laboratory setting.\nA custom-made insert contained a -3D phakic IOL and a 23D monofocal (Precizon Monofocal, Ophtec). Two samples of each phakic IOL were tested using OptiSpheric IOL PRO2 under spherical and chromatic-aberration conditions at 3 and 4.5mm apertures at near (40cm), intermediate (67cm) and far distances. Modulation transfer function (MTF) related variables, and the 1951 USAF resolution target images were compared.\nThe MTFs at far distances, 67cm, and 40cm revealed minor differences between the two IOLs for a 3-mm pupil. Simulated visual acuity showed no disparity at distance but improved by 0.01 and 0.05 logMAR with Artiplus at intermediate and near points. Additionally, Artiplus exhibited a plateau in intermediate performance, while the IPCL demonstrated higher optical quality close to 50cm, corresponding to its secondary-focus location. Both lenses showed reduced optical quality with larger apertures. The USAF resolution target results supported these findings.\nArtiplus and IPCL (+2.5D add) showed good optical quality across the focus range, with Artiplus having a flatter simulated defocus curve. While the expected visual acuity differences were minimal, they may become more pronounced in patients with larger pupils, warranting further investigation.",

In this experiment, students watched and took notes on two lectures. Following a short or long delay, students reviewed their notes either individually or in a group and were allowed to update their notes during these sessions. After the reviewing phase, students completed a final test for each lecture. We found that individuals added more idea units to their notes after reviewing notes in a group, and this beneficial effect was greater after a longer delay compared to a shorter delay. However, more new idea units did not translate into better cued recall performance. Our findings suggest that reviewing notes in a group helps individuals add more overlooked idea units in their notes, but more factors should be considered when studying the relationship between reviewing notes in a group and final test performance.",

        "doi": "10.1098/rstb.2024.0220",
        "abstract": "We examine representational effects of Western numerals on mental arithmetic. An analysis of mental addition tasks using a base-10 place-value notation yields a taxonomy of addition types that is anchored in the notion of complements (i.e. additions with round sums). Two experimental studies use a paradigm of serial addition that presents lists of numbers to adult participants, who mentally represent all intermediate steps. In study 1, participants add sequences of single-digit addends in a self-paced fashion. Study 2 extends this paradigm by simultaneously presenting two addends, thus allowing for a modicum of strategic choice. Both studies vary the number of complements within the lists and measure addition accuracy and latency. Beyond decade and carry effects, our results show that lists containing or enabling complements are easier to add. Addition latencies jointly depend on addition type and problem size. When adders have some discretion about the order of choosing addends, they adaptively exploit the difficulty of addition types by tailoring their sequences to decade boundaries. One motivation for seeking complements lies in enabling subsequent post-complements. Reflecting on the dynamic interplay between numeric representations, strategic choices and cognitive adaptations, we discuss implications for psychological explanations, technology and design.This article is part of the theme issue 'A solid base for scaling up: the structure of numeration systems'.",

        "abstract": "Temporary alcohol abstinence campaigns (TAAC), such as Dry January, aim to encourage behavioural change in the general population. Despite its popularity, a comprehensive evaluation of the French version has not yet been conducted. This prospective study aimed to identify characteristics associated with successful completion of the challenge (i.e., remaining alcohol-free throughout January), and to assess improvements in drinking refusal self-efficacy, sleep quality, and mental and physical health.\nA sample of 2123 French adults participating in Dry January 2024 completed both a baseline and a one-month follow-up questionnaire online. A broad range of variables were assessed, including demographic and contextual factors, alcohol use patterns and motives, drinking refusal self-efficacy, and health-related outcomes.\nKey factors positively associated with successful completion included previous participation, registration, and higher baseline self-efficacy in resisting alcohol in social situations. Among registrants, greater engagement with support emails significantly increased the likelihood of abstinence. In contrast, smoking and identifying one's drinking as excessive were linked to lower odds of completion. The campaign was associated with improvements in drinking refusal self-efficacy, mental well-being, sleep quality, and physical health - particularly among participants who completed the full month without alcohol.\nThis study offers the first evaluation of the French version of Dry January, highlighting the factors influencing challenge completion and short-term benefits of participation. The findings add support to the value of TAAC as scalable and impactful public health tools and underscore the importance of tailored support strategies to maximize participant success and behavioural change.",

        "abstract": "Rh immune globulin (RhIG) is used to prevent D alloimmunization and reduce the risk of hemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn (HDFN). Its use has been expanded to include immunoprophylaxis after D-incompatible transfusions. In the United States, a protracted RhIG shortage began in 2023. The AABB (Association for the Advancement of Blood & Biotherapies) Clinical Hemotherapy Subsection created a survey to assess RhIG usage patterns during this shortage.\nA survey was developed and electronically distributed to AABB-accredited institutions. The number of responses was tallied. Frequencies were calculated, and free text comments were categorized.\nA total of 112 responses (13.7%) were received from all regions of the United States. While 6.2% (6/97) of respondents noticed increased RhIG usage, 70.0% (56/80) experienced a shortage of RhIG. The most common indication reported for RhIG use was D-negative pregnant patients carrying a D-unknown or D-positive fetus/neonate. Some respondents also permitted RhIG use in D-negative adult males and females outside of childbearing age following D-incompatible transfusion. The most common institutional responses to the shortage were to: formally monitor RhIG inventory (n\u2009=\u200937), add (n\u2009=\u200934)/switch (n\u2009=\u200924) manufacturers, and redistribute RhIG between facilities (n\u2009=\u200922). Few respondents (n\u2009=\u20097) limited or discontinued RhIG use in non-obstetric patients.\nWhile the majority of survey respondents were affected by the RhIG shortage, transfusion services still allowed RhIG to be issued outside of obstetric care. Given that RhIG is a limited resource and its intended goal is to reduce anti-D HDFN, more effective management of RhIG utilization is needed.",

Knowledge about the contribution of doctorally prepared clinical nurses (DPCNs) is growing, but further exploration is required. This research explored the value that DPCNs provide to nursing practice and healthcare.\nUsing an interpretive descriptive approach, individual interviews were conducted with 18 DPCNs. Data was collected between 2021 and 2022. Reflexive thematic analysis informed the data analysis.\nFive key mechanisms drive DPCNs' value: being a knowledge expert; an enhanced approach to practice; increased credibility/prestige of the doctorate; valuable conversations; and new opportunities and collaborations. Challenges to value contribution were also highlighted, including identity issues; negative external perceptions; fragmented mentorship; no post-doctoral pathway; and little recognition from nursing leaders.\nDoctorally prepared clinical nurses bring significant value to nursing and healthcare through distinct mechanisms that should be nurtured and strengthened.\nDoctorally prepared clinical nurses add important value to healthcare. However, these nurses are under-utilised and require support to enhance their value contribution.\nIdentifying the mechanisms driving value provides a unique opportunity to acknowledge, support and enhance the value provided by DPCNs. The research will be impactful for nurses considering doctoral study, nursing leaders and healthcare managers.\nThis research is reported following SRQR guidelines.\nThis study did not include patient or public involvement in its design, conduct or reporting.",

        "abstract": "People experiencing homelessness often don't have access to the palliative and end-of-life care they may need. To understand how this can be improved, it is important to collaborate with people with lived experience of homelessness when carrying out research. This can add more depth and insight from experience and ultimately create better evidence to improve systems, services and experiences. Since the publication of the TIFFIN recommendations, which support co-production in the field of palliative care and homelessness research, we have implemented these within our research. The current paper describes reflections from team members on a co-produced research project exploring attitudes to death cafes among people with lived experience of homelessness. These learnings could support wider implementation of safe, meaningful co-production in this field, with implications for co-produced research in other fields.\nWe provide a summary of how we implemented the TIFFIN recommendations in the death cafe study, and reflections and learnings from all four team members on this process and on working collaboratively. All team members kept a diary throughout the project. These diaries logged thoughts and reflections pertaining to the research process and involvement. Entries were not scheduled; team members could add to them as they felt necessary. Verbal, group reflections were also gathered at several points during the research.\nThe TIFFIN recommendations helped us co-produce a research project. Aspects which were particularly important were building rapport between team members and facilitating equitable approaches to involvement. For this project, navigating institutional attitudes and resistance was not a major issue, which may be linked to the established relationships between partner organizations.\nPeople experiencing homelessness often don\u2019t have access to the palliative and end-of-life care they may need. Due to many complicated factors, their end-of-life experiences may not be as good as they could be. To understand how this can be improved, it is important to collaborate with people with lived experience of homelessness when carrying out research. This can add more depth and insight from experience and ultimately create better evidence to improve systems, services and experiences. Despite the importance and challenges of doing this, until recently there has been a lack of guidance about how to do this in a safe and constructive way. In 2024, we published a set of recommendations called \u201cthe TIFFIN recommendations\u201d \u2013 which sets out things to think about when planning and doing palliative and end of life care research alongside with people with lived experience of homelessness. In this paper, we report our reflections on using the TIFFIN recommendations, and on co-producing research in this field. All members of the research team kept a diary throughout the project containing reflections on what they felt was important to the work they had done that week. As well as diaries, conversations were held at regular intervals to reflect upon the work done recently. These discussions were mainly between the lead researcher and co-researcher with lived experience but were sometimes attended by the wider research team. The paper includes a summary of how we implemented the TIFFIN recommendations, and reflections and learning from these experiences. Each TIFFIN recommendation was relevant and useful to the development of the project upon which reflections in this paper are based. The importance of engagement and rapport and facilitating equitable engagement were particularly important considerations. For this project, navigating institutional attitudes and resistance was not a major issue, which may reflect the ongoing relationships between the partners involved in this research.",

        "abstract": "Fibromyalgia (FM) is a chronic pain disorder that is marked by psychological distress. While previous research has predominantly focused on negative outcomes such as anxiety and depression, this study investigates the role of positive psychological constructs-hope, optimism, and emotional regulation-in relation to pain perception among individuals with FM.\nThe study aims to find the relationship between hope, optimism, emotional regulation, and pain in patients with fibromyalgia.\nA total of 270 patients with FM were included in the study. The present study used the Adult Hope Scale, Life Orientation Test-Revised, Emotional Regulation Questionnaire, and Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire Revised to measure hope, optimism, emotional regulation, and pain, respectively. Spearman's correlations were used to explore the relationship between psychological variables and pain severity.\nHope showed a moderate negative correlation with pain, r\u2009=\u2009\u2009-\u2009.34, 95% CI [-\u2009.44,\u2009-\u2009.23], p\u2009<\u2009.001, indicating that individuals with higher levels of hope experienced lower pain. The study found a weak negative correlation of optimism with pain, r\u2009=\u2009\u2009-\u2009.12, 95% CI [-\u2009.15,\u2009-\u2009.09], p\u2009=\u2009.042.\nThese findings suggest that hope plays a pivotal role in modulating pain experiences in FM and should be considered in treatment planning. The study emphasizes the need for multidisciplinary care that integrates cognitive-behavioral techniques, emotion regulation training, and resilience-building exercises for symptom management and overall wellbeing of the patient with chronic pain. The study accounted for age and gender in the analysis; however, other confounding variables such as socioeconomic status, education, disease duration, and comorbidities like depression, anxiety, and social and relational factors were not measured. These factors may influence both psychological outcomes and pain perception.\nThe trial was registered in the clinical trial registry in India.

This review maps the 30-year evolution of PGT-A, from single-cell fluorescence in situ hybridization at the cleavage stage to blastocyst trophectoderm biopsy with comprehensive chromosome sequencing. Each advancement is evaluated against a framework for responsible development requiring analytical validation, predictive-value studies, and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) before clinical use. Repeated deviations from this pathway are documented: early iterations were introduced without validation, and modern versions entered routine practice before robust trials were completed. This premature adoption led to the discarding of potentially viable embryos. Critical appraisal of 6 contemporary RCTs reveals methodological shortcomings in the evidence base for PGT-A. These shortcomings include under-powered designs, enrolment of only good-prognosis patients, absence of cumulative live-birth outcomes, and exclusion of low- and medium-grade mosaic embryo transfers. Consequently, the current evidence does not justify the widespread use of PGT-A we see today.",

The value of the vascular surgery service line within a health care system has been well-described, however, few studies have reported the role of vascular surgeons in supporting regional hospitals lacking vascular surgical coverage. In the present study, we report our institutional experience leveraging the transfer center to improve access to vascular surgical care.\nWe retrospectively queried electronic medical records for all transfer center requests and external consultations to a vascular surgery service at our tertiary-care academic medical center. Data were collected on request status, transfer type, reason for transfer, timing, location of referring hospital, and total number of communications.\nFrom 2021-2023, a total of 16,340 transfer center requests were made to surgical specialties at our institution, of which 1,033 (6.3%) requested vascular surgery service. Over this three-year period, the median number of transfer center requests were 28 per month (interquartile range [IQR], 23-34), with five communications (IQR 4-7) accompanying each transfer request. The most common reasons for transfer included higher level of care (n=695, 67.3%) and lack of on-call vascular surgeons (n=78, 7.6%). Requests originated from a total of 104 referring hospitals across 13 states, including a total of 211 (20.4%) requests from out-of-state. Of all transfer requests, 556 (53.8%) were received after-hours (n=296), on a weekend (n=156), or both (n=104). Half of all requests were ultimately accepted for transfer (n=488, 47.2%). Of these 488 cases, 359 (73.6%) underwent operative intervention within thirty days.\nModern vascular surgical practice at a tertiary referral center necessitates continuous, around-the-clock surgeon availability to meet both institutional needs and external coverage. The transfer center serves as one mechanism for extending vascular surgical care to hospitals without on-site vascular coverage. These findings add to the expanding body of literature aimed at accurately capturing and quantifying the value of the vascular surgeon in contemporary practice.",

        "abstract": "Candidemia is a severe complication in critically ill and immunocompromised patients, and is associated with high morbidity and mortality. While early fungal clearance may improve outcomes, the association between follow-up blood culture (FUBCs) results and clinical outcomes remains insufficiently explored. This sub-analysis of the ECMM Candida III study investigates predictors of persistent candidemia and the impact of positive FUBC results on clinical outcomes.\nThe multicenter ECMM Candida III study enrolled adults with culture-proven candidemia from 60 European centers (2018-2019). This sub-analysis included patients with at least one FUBC result reported (n = 258; 40.8%). Statistical analysis used SPSS 29 and R. Binary logistic regression was used to identify predictors of persistent candidemia. To assess mortality risk factors, Cox proportional hazards regression models were constructed.\nOf 258 patients, 52 (20.2%) had persistent candidemia based on positive FUBCs (median duration of candidemia 6 days). Utilization of echinocandins as first line treatment was less frequent (61.5% vs. 78.2%; p=0.014) in those with positive FUBCs. Mortality was significantly higher in the FUBC-positive group (50% vs. 32%; p=0.016). In the multivariable logistic regression model, lower EQUAL Candida Scores, reflecting reduced adherence to guideline-recommended management, were independently associated with persistent candidemia (OR 0.003, 95% CI 0.0002 - 0.07; p<0.001). Univariable Cox regression identified persistent candidemia \u22655 days (HR 2.16; 95% CI 1.33 - 3.53; p= 0.002) as a significant predictor of mortality. In the multivariable Cox regression model, intensive care unit (ICU) admission (HR 1.59, 95% CI 1.02 - 2.50; p= 0.039) and persistent candidemia \u22655 days (HR 2.06, 95% CI 1.26 - 3.37; p= 0.004) remained independent predictors of mortality.\nPersistent candidemia was predicted by poor adherence to treatment guidelines, as shown by low EQUAL Candida Scores, particularly due to the lack of initial echinocandin use. After controlling immortal time bias, persistent candidemia \u22655 days and ICU admission remained independent predictors of mortality in the multivariable model.\nInvestigator Initiated Research Grant from Scynexis and Mundipharma were obtained to support the study.",

Data pertaining to children with epilepsy aged <18 years in the ADD-ON study were evaluated. Seizure freedom rates at 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after starting CLB were analyzed. Seizure diaries and personal interviews were used to assess seizure control and side effects.\nOf the 475 eligible participants from the ADD-ON study, 107 (22.5%) children were included. The median age was 13.0 (range, 3-17) years and 62.6% were boys. The median epilepsy duration was 2.0 years (range, 0.1-16). Majority of the children (n=43, 40.2%) had tonic-clonic seizures. The major reason for adding CLB to the existing therapy was inadequate control of seizures with current treatment (n=105, 98.1%). Of the 107 children, 92 completed one year of follow-up and were receiving CLB (retention rate: 85.9%) and at one-year, 74 (69.2%) children were seizure-free. Seizure freedom rates were similar for all seizure types. No major adverse effects related to clobazam were recorded during the study period.\nThis subanalysis of the ADD-ON study suggests that clobazam is effective and well-tolerated as an add-on therapy for children after the failure of the first ASM monotherapy. Our preliminary results from this one-year follow-up study need to be substantiated by randomized controlled studies.\nCTRI/2017/12/010906.",

TorchANI 2.0 builds upon the foundation of its predecessor, while addressing its limitations and introducing new features. These changes greatly enhance its extensibility, performance, and suitability as a framework for developing models ready for molecular dynamics applications. These improvements include the introduction of a modular system to add arbitrary pairwise potentials to models, CUDA-accelerated optimization for faster and more memory-efficient calculation of local atomic features, and a batched system for better performance of network ensembles, among others. Our benchmarks demonstrate that TorchANI 2.0 achieves significant speedup over previous versions in both training and inference, and the library enhancements allow users to train physically constrained models that better represent important qualities of chemical systems. We demonstrate this by introducing three new ANI models that incorporate these features and evaluating their capabilities.",

        "abstract": "Infection prevention and control (IPC) and antibiotic stewardship (ABS) represent promising approaches for reducing the prevalence of healthcare-associated infections (HAI) and antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in different healthcare settings. However, the combined use of IPC and ABS measures and ways to optimize their integrated implementation have been insufficiently considered and assessed. The REVERSE trial, funded by the European Union's Horizon 2020 program, involves 24 acute care hospitals from four European countries, all with high rates of AMR and HAI. REVERSE aims to investigate whether the sequential implementation of an IPC and an ABS practice bundle is feasible and sustainable and whether externally guided tailoring as an enhanced implementation strategy leads to superior clinical and implementation outcomes compared to a basic implementation condition.\nREVERSE will be designed as a stepped wedge cluster randomized, hybrid type 2 trial, including an embedded implementation trial. Four cohorts of six acute care hospitals will sequentially enter the trial over 38\u00a0months and work to implement first IPC, and, after 1\u00a0year, add the ABS practice bundle. Simultaneously, hospitals will be provided basic implementation training and instructed to tailor their implementation, with half of the hospitals being self-guided in their tailoring, whereas hospitals in the enhanced implementation condition will receive time-limited external facilitation in practicing tailoring. Qualitative data will be collected longitudinally to investigate contextual conditions for implementing IPC and ABS locally and how they contribute to tailoring results. IPC and ABS feasibility, fidelity, and sustainability will be assessed together with tailoring fidelity using repeated measures. Retrospective, in-depth, explanatory case studies will be conducted to interpret hospital outcomes.\nREVERSE is an extensive and complex effectiveness-implementation trial aimed at investigating tailoring effectiveness. It will contribute to the still scarce evidence base for this adaptive approach to integrating research-supported interventions into routine healthcare settings. By identifying pathways toward strengthening the integration of IPC and ABS practices at European acute care hospitals, REVERSE also has the potential to inform much-needed concerted efforts to combat the growing challenge of antimicrobial resistance in the region.\nIn November 2021, the REVERSE study was registered with the \"International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial Number\" (ISRCTN) register under nr.12956554.",

        "doi": "10.1186/s12967-025-06976-4",
        "abstract": "In the realm of cellular biochemistry, mitochondria have been increasingly recognized for their critical role in both cellular metabolism and the etiology of various diseases. Mitochondrial transporters (MTs) are essential for maintaining cellular energy dynamics and metabolic fluxes by facilitating the bidirectional transfer of metabolites across mitochondrial membranes. Dysregulation of these transporters, such as the mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC), citrate carrier (SLC25A1), and voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC), disrupts energy metabolism, redox balance, and cellular signaling, contributing to the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs), cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), type 2 diabetes (T2D), and cancer. In NDDs, impaired transporters exacerbate oxidative stress and neuronal death, while in CVDs, they lead to energy deficits and heart failure. In T2D, dysfunctional transporters like MPC and carnitine palmitoyltransferase (CPT) systems drive insulin resistance and metabolic dysregulation. In cancer, upregulated transporters such as citrate carrier (SLC25A1), and dicarboxylate carrier (SLC25A10) as well as metabolic shifts like the Warburg effect support tumor growth and survival. Targeting MTs and metabolic reprogramming (MR) offers significant therapeutic potential. Preclinical studies have demonstrated the efficacy of mitochondrial-targeted therapies (MTT), such as adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activators and antioxidants, in restoring metabolic homeostasis and reducing disease pathology. In cancer, inhibitors of glutamine transporters and VDAC1 are being explored to disrupt tumor metabolism. Several therapies are advancing to clinical trials, including mitochondrial-targeted drugs for NDDs and metabolic modulators for T2D and cancer, highlighting their translational potential. Despite notable individual achievements and isolated reviews in this field, there remains a lack of comprehensive syntheses that integrate these advancements. This review seeks to combine the prevailing scientific evidence and outline prospective research trajectories. The gathered data robustly support the significant potential of targeting MTs as a groundbreaking approach in the treatment of complex diseases, with the potential to significantly improve health outcomes and mitigate disease progression.",

        "doi": "10.1007/s40122-025-00776-w",
        "abstract": "Lumbar disc herniation (LDH) is characterized by the displacement of intervertebral disc material with compression of adjacent nerve roots, leading to nociceptive and neuropathic pain in the lower limbs and lower back. The Miro-Hers study explored the efficacy and safety of mirogabalin add-on treatment in combination with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) compared with NSAIDs alone. We hypothesized that mirogabalin added on to NSAID therapy may reduce neuropathic pain due to LDH more than NSAIDs alone.\nThis was a multicenter, 8-week, randomized (1:1), open-label, parallel-group study conducted in Japan between March 2023 and September 2024. The study included participants with LDH diagnosed by magnetic resonance imaging who had inadequately controlled lower limb pain [numerical rating scale (NRS) score\u00a0\u2265\u00a04] despite NSAID treatment. The primary endpoint was the change in the NRS score for lower limb pain from baseline to Week 8. The secondary endpoints included quality of life, as assessed by the EuroQol 5 dimensions 5-level score (EQ-5D-5L), and NRS score for sleep disturbance. Safety endpoints included treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) and adverse drug reactions (ADRs).\nOf the 182 participants screened and randomized, 90 in the mirogabalin add-on group and 89 in the NSAIDs alone group were included in the efficacy analysis. The reduction in NRS score for lower limb pain from baseline to Week 8 was significantly greater in the mirogabalin add-on group than in the NSAIDs alone group, with least squares mean changes of\u00a0-\u00a03.8 [95% confidence interval (CI):\u00a0-\u00a04.4,\u00a0-\u00a03.3] and\u00a0-\u00a02.2 (-\u00a02.8,\u00a0-\u00a01.7), respectively [intergroup difference\u00a0-\u00a01.6 (-\u00a02.4,\u00a0-\u00a00.8); P\u00a0<\u00a00.001]. EQ-5D-5L and NRS score for sleep disturbance both significantly improved over the study period with mirogabalin add-on treatment compared with NSAIDs alone [intergroup difference: 0.0653 (95% CI 0.0235, 0.1071); P\u00a0=\u00a00.002 and\u00a0-\u00a01.3 (-\u00a01.9,\u00a0-\u00a00.7); P\u00a0<\u00a00.001, respectively]. No severe or serious TEAEs were observed. In the mirogabalin add-on group, ADRs were observed in 48.9% of participants, with somnolence (31.1%) and dizziness (18.9%) being the most common.\nThe addition of mirogabalin to NSAIDs treatment significantly improved pain, quality of life, and sleep disturbance in patients with LDH, with no previously undocumented safety concerns identified.\nJapan Registry of Clinical Trials (jRCTs061220102, registered 27/February/2023, https://jrct.mhlw.go.jp/en-latest-detail/jRCTs061220102 ).",

        "abstract": "New disease-modifying therapies, such as teplizumab, offer opportunities to delay the clinical onset of type 1 diabetes but require islet autoantibody screening to identify individuals at increased risk of progression to diabetes. As type 1 diabetes screening programmes expand, clinicians will increasingly encounter a new group of people: adults who test positive for islet autoantibodies but have not yet been diagnosed with diabetes. Although international guidelines outline management for both children and adults, considerable uncertainties remain, particularly for adults. In adults with islet autoantibody positivity, the lower risk of progression to type 1 diabetes compared with children, combined with the high background prevalence of mild non-autoimmune dysglycaemia, presents substantial challenges for clinical management. This Personal View aims to add clarity to international consensus guidelines, proposing a pragmatic framework for managing adults with islet autoantibody positivity. Although fitting within a UK National Health Service setting, we feel this framework is also relevant to other health systems.",

        "abstract": "Fear of Falling (FOF) is a common and natural behavior experienced by most of the elderly population during aging. It is thought to be caused by previous falls, dizziness, depression, and neuromotor impairments. However, the association between FOF and salivary biomarkers such as Cortisol (COR), Testosterone (TT), Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), and alpha-amylase activities has not been consistently explored.\nTo explore the association between FOF and general health status, Functional Fitness (FF), and salivary-related stress biomarkers in institutionalized older women.\nA total of 278 older women were assessed and grouped as having Higher (n = 176) or Lower FOF (n = 102), according to the Falls Efficacy Scale. Saliva samples were collected.\nThe Higher FOF group had superior scores in the depressive state and comorbidity scale (p \u2264 0.05). Participants with Lower FOF showed better FF scores. Salivary levels of cortisol were higher, and DHEA levels were lower in the High FOF group (p \u2264 0.05). Spearman's Rank test showed that FOF was inversely correlated with DHEA, alpha-amylase, and FF, whereas COR was directly associated with the FOF scale. Regression analysis indicated that functional fitness indicators were significantly associated with variations in FOF. However, after adjusting for covariates, the influence of physical-functional fitness was reduced, while depressive symptoms and DHEA levels remained statistically significant in the model, suggesting their stronger association with FOF. The observed associations between FOF and biomarkers, especially DHEA, add important evidence to the growing body of literature exploring the multifactorial nature of FOF. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the biological components involved and may help inform fall-risk monitoring strategies in institutionalized older populations.",

In 2021, 15.2% had at least one mental disorder. Anxiety disorders were most prevalent (4.9%), followed by conduct disorder (2.7%), ADHD (2.6%), and depressive disorders (2.4%), with major depressive disorder affecting 2.0%.

Schizophrenia (0.04%) and other disorders (0.2%) contributed smaller fractions. Substance use disorders affected 0.8%, mainly drug use (0.5%) and alcohol (0.3%), with cannabis use disorders at 0.4%. Prevalence varied by sex, region, and socio-demographic development: females showed higher internalizing conditions, males higher externalizing disorders. High-SDI regions had highest prevalence (20.7%) versus low-SDI (13.4%); High-Income North America recorded 22.8%, South Asia 9.7%, and Sub-Saharan Africa 11.6%, likely reflecting under-recognition, stigma, and limited diagnostic capacity.

In particular, formulations that release methylphenidate slowly into the bloodstream (\u2018prolonged-release\u2019 [PR] formulations) are more effective at controlling symptoms over the course of each day than those that release methylphenidate more quickly (\u2018immediate-release\u2019 [IR] formulations).

In total, 24 healthy adults participated in each study. The studies were divided into two parts\u2014initially, participants received either the PR formulation or the IR formulation; 7 days later, they received whichever formulation they had not received in the first part of the study. Over the 24 h, after each treatment was received, blood samples were taken to determine methylphenidate concentrations, and adverse effects were assessed. Exposure to methylphenidate was similar with each PR formulation versus the IR formulation. Further, the PR formulations were well-tolerated by participants, having adverse effects similar to those previously reported for methylphenidate. Therefore, the methylphenidate PR oral suspension and chewable tablet formulations can be considered important additions to the treatment options available for ADHD.",

The AI intervention employed a process that captured children's drawings, converted them into keywords, generated AI responses based on those keywords, and provided feedback to the children, while the control group received therapist-guided verbal feedback. SNAP-IV-26(Swanson, Nolan and Pelham-IV rating scales) and WFIRS-P(Weiss Functional Impairment Rating Scales-Parent) scales assessed at baseline (T1) and post-intervention (T2) at a 24-week interval, with data analyzed using independent t-tests (p\u202f<\u202f0.05).\nBoth AI-assisted and traditional drawing therapies significantly reduced core ADHD symptoms. In the before-and-after comparison within the group, the AI group showed targeted improvements in attention (p\u202f=\u202f0.039) and oppositional defiant behaviour (p\u202f=\u202f0.025), while traditional therapy produced broader symptom reductions across all domains (p\u202f<\u202f0.05). Between-group comparisons showed that the AI-assisted group achieved greater improvement in inattention (\u0394 = -1.09, p\u202f=\u202f0.035), whereas the traditional drawing group improved more on oppositional defiant behavior (\u0394=+1.706, p\u202f=\u202f0.010) and the SNAP-IV total score (\u0394=+4.777, p\u202f=\u202f0.041). On the WFIRS-P, the AI group showed advantages for the Family domain (p\u202f=\u202f0.041) and the total score (p\u202f=\u202f0.047), while Self-Concept favored the traditional drawing group (p\u202f=\u202f0.036).\nAI-assisted, drawing-based art therapy produced greater improvement in the pre-specified primary outcome (SNAP-IV inattention) and select WFIRS-P domains (e.g., Family, total score), whereas conventional drawing therapy yielded broader reductions in oppositional defiant symptoms and the overall SNAP-IV severity. Effects were modest and domain-specific; larger, multi-center trials are needed to confirm efficacy and identify which children benefit most.",

        "doi": "10.1016/S0140-6736(25)01917-8",
        "abstract": "Timely and comprehensive analyses of causes of death stratified by age, sex, and location are essential for shaping effective health policies aimed at reducing global mortality. The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2023 provides cause-specific mortality estimates measured in counts, rates, and years of life lost (YLLs). GBD 2023 aimed to enhance our understanding of the relationship between age and cause of death by quantifying the probability of dying before age 70 years (70q0) and the mean age at death by cause and sex. This study enables comparisons of the impact of causes of death over time, offering a deeper understanding of how these causes affect global populations.\nGBD 2023 produced estimates for 292 causes of death disaggregated by age-sex-location-year in 204 countries and territories and 660 subnational locations for each year from 1990 until 2023. We used a modelling tool developed for GBD, the Cause of Death Ensemble model (CODEm), to estimate cause-specific death rates for most causes. We computed YLLs as the product of the number of deaths for each cause-age-sex-location-year and the standard life expectancy at each age. Probability of death was calculated as the chance of dying from a given cause in a specific age period, for a specific population. Mean age at death was calculated by first assigning the midpoint age of each age group for every death, followed by computing the mean of all midpoint ages across all deaths attributed to a given cause. We used GBD death estimates to calculate the observed mean age at death and to model the expected mean age across causes, sexes, years, and locations. The expected mean age reflects the expected mean age at death for individuals within a population, based on global mortality rates and the population's age structure. Comparatively, the observed mean age represents the actual mean age at death, influenced by all factors unique to a location-specific population, including its age structure. As part of the modelling process, uncertainty intervals (UIs) were generated using the 2\u00b75th and 97\u00b75th percentiles from a 250-draw distribution for each metric. Findings are reported as counts and age-standardised rates. Methodological improvements for cause-of-death estimates in GBD 2023 include a correction for the misclassification of deaths due to COVID-19, updates to the method used to estimate COVID-19, and updates to the CODEm modelling framework. This analysis used 55\u2008761 data sources, including vital registration and verbal autopsy data as well as data from surveys, censuses, surveillance systems, and cancer registries, among others. For GBD 2023, there were 312 new country-years of vital registration cause-of-death data, 3 country-years of surveillance data, 51 country-years of verbal autopsy data, and 144 country-years of other data types that were added to those used in previous GBD rounds.\nThe initial years of the COVID-19 pandemic caused shifts in long-standing rankings of the leading causes of global deaths: it ranked as the number one age-standardised cause of death at Level 3 of the GBD cause classification hierarchy in 2021. By 2023, COVID-19 dropped to the 20th place among the leading global causes, returning the rankings of the leading two causes to those typical across the time series (ie, ischaemic heart disease and stroke). While ischaemic heart disease and stroke persist as leading causes of death, there has been progress in reducing their age-standardised mortality rates globally. Four other leading causes have also shown large declines in global age-standardised mortality rates across the study period: diarrhoeal diseases, tuberculosis, stomach cancer, and measles. Other causes of death showed disparate patterns between sexes, notably for deaths from conflict and terrorism in some locations. A large reduction in age-standardised rates of YLLs occurred for neonatal disorders. Despite this, neonatal disorders remained the leading cause of global YLLs over the period studied, except in 2021, when COVID-19 was temporarily the leading cause. Compared to 1990, there has been a considerable reduction in total YLLs in many vaccine-preventable diseases, most notably diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus, and measles. In addition, this study quantified the mean age at death for all-cause mortality and cause-specific mortality and found noticeable variation by sex and location. The global all-cause mean age at death increased from 46\u00b78 years (95% UI 46\u00b76-47\u00b70) in 1990 to 63\u00b74 years (63\u00b71-63\u00b77) in 2023. For males, mean age increased from 45\u00b74 years (45\u00b71-45\u00b77) to 61\u00b72 years (60\u00b77-61\u00b76), and for females it increased from 48\u00b75 years (48\u00b71-48\u00b78) to 65\u00b79 years (65\u00b75-66\u00b73), from 1990 to 2023. The highest all-cause mean age at death in 2023 was found in the high-income super-region, where the mean age for females reached 80\u00b79 years (80\u00b79-81\u00b70) and for males 74\u00b78 years (74\u00b78-74\u00b79). By comparison, the lowest all-cause mean age at death occurred in sub-Saharan Africa, where it was 38\u00b70 years (37\u00b75-38\u00b74) for females and 35\u00b76 years (35\u00b72-35\u00b79) for males in 2023. Lastly, our study found that all-cause 70q0 decreased across each GBD super-region and region from 2000 to 2023, although with large variability between them. For females, we found that 70q0 notably increased from drug use disorders and conflict and terrorism. Leading causes that increased 70q0 for males also included drug use disorders, as well as diabetes. In sub-Saharan Africa, there was an increase in 70q0 for many non-communicable diseases (NCDs). Additionally, the mean age at death from NCDs was lower than the expected mean age at death for this super-region. By comparison, there was an increase in 70q0 for drug use disorders in the high-income super-region, which also had an observed mean age at death lower than the expected value.\nWe examined global mortality patterns over the past three decades, highlighting-with enhanced estimation methods-the impacts of major events such as the COVID-19 pandemic, in addition to broader trends such as increasing NCDs in low-income regions that reflect ongoing shifts in the global epidemiological transition. This study also delves into premature mortality patterns, exploring the interplay between age and causes of death and deepening our understanding of where targeted resources could be applied to further reduce preventable sources of mortality. We provide essential insights into global and regional health disparities, identifying locations in need of targeted interventions to address both communicable and non-communicable diseases. There is an ever-present need for strengthened health-care systems that are resilient to future pandemics and the shifting burden of disease, particularly among ageing populations in regions with high mortality rates. Robust estimates of causes of death are increasingly essential to inform health priorities and guide efforts toward achieving global health equity. The need for global collaboration to reduce preventable mortality is more important than ever, as shifting burdens of disease are affecting all nations, albeit at different paces and scales.\nGates Foundation.",

        "abstract": "For more than three decades, the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) has provided a framework to quantify health loss due to diseases, injuries, and associated risk factors. This paper presents GBD 2023 findings on disease and injury burden and risk-attributable health loss, offering a global audit of the state of world health to inform public health priorities. This work captures the evolving landscape of health metrics across age groups, sexes, and locations, while reflecting on the remaining post-COVID-19 challenges to achieving our collective global health ambitions.\nThe GBD 2023 combined analysis estimated years lived with disability (YLDs), years of life lost (YLLs), and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) for 375 diseases and injuries, and risk-attributable burden associated with 88 modifiable risk factors. Of the more than 310\u2008000 total data sources used for all GBD 2023 (about 30% of which were new to this estimation round), more than 120\u2008000 sources were used for estimation of disease and injury burden and 59\u2008000 for risk factor estimation, and included vital registration systems, surveys, disease registries, and published scientific literature. Data were analysed using previously established modelling approaches, such as disease modelling meta-regression version 2.1 (DisMod-MR 2.1) and comparative risk assessment methods. Diseases and injuries were categorised into four levels on the basis of the established GBD cause hierarchy, as were risk factors using the GBD risk hierarchy. Estimates stratified by age, sex, location, and year from 1990 to 2023 were focused on disease-specific time trends over the 2010-23 period and presented as counts (to three significant figures) and age-standardised rates per 100\u2008000 person-years (to one decimal place). For each measure, 95% uncertainty intervals [UIs] were calculated with the 2\u00b75th and 97\u00b75th percentile ordered values from a 250-draw distribution.\nTotal numbers of global DALYs grew 6\u00b71% (95% UI 4\u00b70-8\u00b71), from 2\u00b764 billion (2\u00b746-2\u00b786) in 2010 to 2\u00b780 billion (2\u00b757-3\u00b708) in 2023, but age-standardised DALY rates, which account for population growth and ageing, decreased by 12\u00b76% (11\u00b70-14\u00b71), revealing large long-term health improvements. Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) contributed 1\u00b745 billion (1\u00b731-1\u00b761) global DALYs in 2010, increasing to 1\u00b780 billion (1\u00b763-2\u00b703) in 2023, alongside a concurrent 4\u00b71% (1\u00b79-6\u00b73) reduction in age-standardised rates. Based on DALY counts, the leading level 3 NCDs in 2023 were ischaemic heart disease (193 million [176-209] DALYs), stroke (157 million [141-172]), and diabetes (90\u00b72 million [75\u00b72-107]), with the largest increases in age-standardised rates since 2010 occurring for anxiety disorders (62\u00b78% [34\u00b70-107\u00b75]), depressive disorders (26\u00b73% [11\u00b76-42\u00b79]), and diabetes (14\u00b79% [7\u00b75-25\u00b76]). Remarkable health gains were made for communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional (CMNN) diseases, with DALYs falling from 874 million (837-917) in 2010 to 681 million (642-736) in 2023, and a 25\u00b78% (22\u00b76-28\u00b77) reduction in age-standardised DALY rates. During the COVID-19 pandemic, DALYs due to CMNN diseases rose but returned to pre-pandemic levels by 2023. From 2010 to 2023, decreases in age-standardised rates for CMNN diseases were led by rate decreases of 49\u00b71% (32\u00b77-61\u00b70) for diarrhoeal diseases, 42\u00b79% (38\u00b70-48\u00b70) for HIV/AIDS, and 42\u00b72% (23\u00b76-56\u00b76) for tuberculosis. Neonatal disorders and lower respiratory infections remained the leading level 3 CMNN causes globally in 2023, although both showed notable rate decreases from 2010, declining by 16\u00b75% (10\u00b76-22\u00b70) and 24\u00b78% (7\u00b74-36\u00b77), respectively. Injury-related age-standardised DALY rates decreased by 15\u00b76% (10\u00b77-19\u00b78) over the same period. Differences in burden due to NCDs, CMNN diseases, and injuries persisted across age, sex, time, and location. Based on our risk analysis, nearly 50% (1\u00b727 billion [1\u00b718-1\u00b738]) of the roughly 2\u00b780 billion total global DALYs in 2023 were attributable to the 88 risk factors analysed in GBD. Globally, the five level 3 risk factors contributing the highest proportion of risk-attributable DALYs were high systolic blood pressure (SBP), particulate matter pollution, high fasting plasma glucose (FPG), smoking, and low birthweight and short gestation-with high SBP accounting for 8\u00b74% (6\u00b79-10\u00b70) of total DALYs. Of the three overarching level 1 GBD risk factor categories-behavioural, metabolic, and environmental and occupational-risk-attributable DALYs rose between 2010 and 2023 only for metabolic risks, increasing by 30\u00b77% (24\u00b78-37\u00b73); however, age-standardised DALY rates attributable to metabolic risks decreased by 6\u00b77% (2\u00b70-11\u00b70) over the same period. For all but three of the 25 leading level 3 risk factors, age-standardised rates dropped between 2010 and 2023-eg, declining by 54\u00b74% (38\u00b77-65\u00b73) for unsafe sanitation, 50\u00b75% (33\u00b73-63\u00b71) for unsafe water source, and 45\u00b72% (25\u00b76-72\u00b70) for no access to handwashing facility, and by 44\u00b79% (37\u00b73-53\u00b75) for child growth failure. The three leading level 3 risk factors for which age-standardised attributable DALY rates rose were high BMI (10\u00b75% [0\u00b71 to 20\u00b79]), drug use (8\u00b74% [2\u00b76 to 15\u00b73]), and high FPG (6\u00b72% [-2\u00b77 to 15\u00b76]; non-significant).\nOur findings underscore the complex and dynamic nature of global health challenges. Since 2010, there have been large decreases in burden due to CMNN diseases and many environmental and behavioural risk factors, juxtaposed with sizeable increases in DALYs attributable to metabolic risk factors and NCDs in growing and ageing populations. This long-observed consequence of the global epidemiological transition was only temporarily interrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic. The substantially decreasing CMNN disease burden, despite the 2008 global financial crisis and pandemic-related disruptions, is one of the greatest collective public health successes known. However, these achievements are at risk of being reversed due to major cuts to development assistance for health globally, the effects of which will hit low-income countries with high burden the hardest. Without sustained investment in evidence-based interventions and policies, progress could stall or reverse, leading to widespread human costs and geopolitical instability. Moreover, the rising NCD burden necessitates intensified efforts to mitigate exposure to leading risk factors-eg, air pollution, smoking, and metabolic risks, such as high SBP, BMI, and FPG-including policies that promote food security, healthier diets, physical activity, and equitable and expanded access to potential treatments, such as GLP-1 receptor agonists. Decisive, coordinated action is needed to address long-standing yet growing health challenges, including depressive and anxiety disorders. Yet this can be only part of the solution. Our response to the NCD syndemic-the complex interaction of multiple health risks, social determinants, and systemic challenges-will define the future landscape of global health. To ensure human wellbeing, economic stability, and social equity, global action to sustain and advance health gains must prioritise reducing disparities by addressing socioeconomic and demographic determinants, ensuring equitable health-care access, tackling malnutrition, strengthening health systems, and improving vaccination coverage. We live in times of great opportunity.\nGates Foundation and Bloomberg Philanthropies.",

Bivariate testing and logistic regression modeling were used to establish the relationships between baseline factors and recurrence of interpersonal trauma over the subsequent six months. Variables of interest included baseline psychiatric symptoms, risk for substance abuse, depressive symptom severity, perceived social support, and psychiatric treatment status.\nA history of multiple types of interpersonal trauma was present in 62.6% of the sample at baseline, and 28.5% of participants experiencing trauma recurrence within six months. Baseline features associated with recurrence included a history of 1) sexual assault, cyberbullying, and/or serious verbal threat; 2) >1 type of interpersonal trauma; 3) attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD); 4) moderate (but not high) depressive symptom levels; 5) high substance abuse risk; and 6) current psychiatric treatment.

        "abstract": "There has been a national increase in fatal and nonfatal overdoses involving stimulants, and 4.5 million US individuals meet criteria for stimulant use disorder (UD), with the highest prevalence in young adults. However, limited information exists on trends in diagnosed stimulant UD.\nTo estimate trends in the proportion of adolescent and young adult Medicaid enrollees diagnosed with a stimulant UD from 2001 to 2020.\nA repeated cross-sectional study (2001-2020) was conducted using administrative health care claims data from Medicaid (public insurance program in US). Publicly insured adolescents (aged 13-17 years) and young adults (aged 18-24 or 25-29 years) from 42 US states were included. Data were analyzed from January 2025 to July 2025.\nStimulant UD was defined as an inpatient or outpatient International Classification of Diseases diagnosis code in the year, with cocaine UD and noncocaine psychostimulant UD evaluated separately. The annual proportion with stimulant UD diagnoses was stratified by age group, sex, race and ethnicity, and presence of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) diagnosis or stimulant prescription in the year. Differences comparing 2001 with 2020 were summarized. Characteristics of those diagnosed with stimulant UD in 2020 were described.\nThe sample included 5.7 million (2001) to 16.1 million Medicaid enrollees (2020) per year; in 2020, 54.2% were female, and 7.1 million were adolescents. From 2001 to 2020, the proportion diagnosed with noncocaine psychostimulant UD increased from 0.09% to 0.49% (prevalence ratio [PR],\u20095.47 [95% CI, 5.20-5.75]) in those aged 18 to 24 years, from 0.13% to 1.63% (PR,\u200912.55 [95% CI, 11.83-13.31]) for ages 25 to 29 years, and from 0.10% to 0.91% among young adults aged 18 to 29 years. Among adolescents, the proportion diagnosed with noncocaine psychostimulant UD varied between 0.03% and 0.07%. The proportion diagnosed with cocaine UD was stable in young adults (range, 0.17%-0.34% [18-24 years] and 0.53%-0.79% [25-29 years]) and declined in adolescents (from 0.04% to 0.01%). Cocaine and noncocaine psychostimulant UD diagnoses were 2 to 4 times more common in patients with an ADHD diagnosis or stimulant prescription. Most patients diagnosed with a stimulant UD in 2020 were also diagnosed with a mental health disorder (68%-82%) or other substance UD (72%-78%).\nThe prevalence of noncocaine psychostimulant UD diagnoses in young adult Medicaid patients increased over the last 2 decades, potentially associated with an increasing use of prescription and illicit stimulants along with increased clinical detection. These trends raise concerns given recent rises in stimulant-involved overdose fatalities and stress the need for evidence-based stimulant UD treatments for young people.",

        "doi": "10.1007/s12640-025-00763-1",
        "abstract": "Novelty-seeking (NS) refers to the tendency of humans and animals to explore novel and unfamiliar stimuli and environments. It is a core feature of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and associated with multiple psychiatric disorders. Recent researches indicated that NS behavior has an effect on reward-related learning. The hippocampus is a core brain region linked to reward-related learning and memory. However, how the hippocampal proteome modulates NS behavior remain largely elusive. In current study, we identified 165 differentially expressed proteins in the hippocampus between high and low novelty response mice with mass-spectrometry-based proteomics. Among these proteins, the over-expression of Tenascin-R (TNR) in high novelty response mice was verified with Western Blot and Immunofluorescence imaging. Moreover, systematic genetic analysis based on the BXD strains showed the expression of TNR is genetically cis-regulation. Further, gene co-expression analysis revealed that TNR has a negative connection with the expression of dopamine receptor D2 (DRD2) (P\u2009=\u20090.003, r = -0.298). And the knockdown of TNR enhanced the expression of DRD2 in vitro. Finally, we constructed a correlation network to exhibit the links among TNR gene variant, expression of TNR and DRD2, and NS related behaviors. Our study provides a novel hippocampal biomarker with preliminary insights into its association with the dopaminergic synaptic pathway. ROC analysis further confirms TNR's robust discriminatory power for distinguishing novel open field behavior, a key NS - related phenotype, which may be a new strategy for diagnosis of NS-related traits.",

        "abstract": "The use of antipsychotics (APs) in children and adolescents has increased notably worldwide, often beyond approved indications. However, most real-world studies lack direct information on the clinical reasons for prescribing. In this population-based study conducted in the region of Valencia, Spain, we analysed 128,057 AP treatments, comprising 741,213 prescriptions, issued to 30,383 individuals aged 0-19 years between 2015 and 2023, using real-world data that uniquely includes prescriber-recorded indications. We described the distribution and temporal evolution of the number of AP treatments by indication, age, sex, and active substance. The most frequent indications were disorders of personality and behaviour (20.2% of treatments), attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (14.2%), autism spectrum disorders (13.9%), anxiety-related disorders (11.4%), and psychotic disorders (5.8%). Among the most frequent indications, depression treatments showed the steepest increase (5.7-fold). Sharp rises also were observed for suicidal ideation (30.7-fold), psychoactive drug use (2.8-fold), eating disorders (2.3-fold), and autism-related conditions (2.2-fold). Changes were more pronounced in females and older adolescents, particularly after 2020. The number of ADHD treatments declined substantially over time. Sulpiride was almost exclusively prescribed for dizziness, a non-psychiatric but approved indication in adults in Spain. Our findings align with international trends but provide greater specificity thanks to the direct link between prescriptions and indications. This study highlights an increase in the volume of AP treatments in paediatric populations, mostly in non-approved, and potentially high-risk indications, some of which have not been previously documented. Our results underscore the need for close monitoring and further evaluation of the appropriateness and safety of antipsychotic prescription in the youth.",

        "abstract": "Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) frequently persists into adulthood and leads to significant impairment across multiple domains. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) has been proposed as a promising adjunctive treatment. We aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of a structured group-based CBT program for adults with ADHD and examine whether cognitive ability and treatment adherence moderate treatment response.\nA retrospective analysis was conducted on 24 adults who completed a 10-session group CBT program. ADHD symptoms were assessed pre and postintervention using the Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale (ASRS) and Korean Adult ADHD Rating Scale (K-AARS). Subgroup analyses were performed based on full-scale intelligence quotient (FSIQ), session attendance, and presence of comorbid depression.\nA significant improvement in symptoms was observed across most ASRS and K-AARS domains. Functional impairment, as measured using the K-AARS impairment subscale, also improved significantly. Participants with an average FSIQ (90-109) showed the most consistent improvements, whereas those with below-average and high FSIQ also benefited to varying degrees. Higher attendance rates were associated with greater reduction in symptoms. The presence of comorbid depression did not significantly affect the treatment outcomes.\nGroup-based CBT is an effective adjunct intervention for managing adult ADHD symptoms. Notably, the intervention led to significant improvements in functional impairment, highlighting its potential to enhance daily functioning in adults with ADHD. Tailoring interventions based on cognitive profiles and emphasizing treatment adherence may enhance therapeutic outcomes. Future studies should employ larger sample sizes, randomized controlled designs, and longitudinal follow-up assessments to validate and extend these findings.",

        "abstract": "Psychoeducational group programs have shown promising results for people with attention-deficit/hyperactive disorders (ADHD). This pilot study aimed to investigate the impact of a new co-produced psychoeducational group intervention on quality of life (QoL), ADHD-related symptoms, and patient satisfaction.\nThis pragmatic pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) had two parallel arms. Outpatients were recruited in two community mental health centers (CMHCs) in the Central Norway Regional Health Authority. Patients eligible for inclusion were diagnosed with ADHD. The psychoeducation group (PG) received a 10-session psychoeducational group program as a supplement to treatment as usual (TAU), while the control group (CG) received TAU only. The program was developed in collaboration between user representatives and health professionals. While the primary aim of this pilot study was to assess the preliminary impact of the intervention, we conducted exploratory between-group comparisons to identify potential effects on patient-centered outcomes. The primary outcome was QoL measured with the Adult ADHD Quality of Life Scale (AAQoL). Secondary outcomes were ADHD symptom severity (Adult Self-Report Scale, 6-Item) and patient satisfaction (Satisfaction with Information on ADHD and Treatment Scale). We collected data at baseline, pre-, and post-intervention (T0, T1, and T2 respectively).\nOf 49 patients, 27 were allocated to the PG and 22 to the CG. Between-group comparisons using linear mixed models indicated a statistically significant improvement in QoL (mean difference\u2009=\u20096.90; p\u2009=\u20090.04; 95% CI [0.20-13.60]; Cohen's d\u2009=\u20090.49). Outpatients in the PG reported significantly higher satisfaction with information as compared to the CG (mean difference\u2009=\u20092.14; p\u2009=\u20090.02; 95% CI [0.33-3.95]; Cohen's d\u2009=\u20090.78). However, there were no significant differences in ADHD symptoms between the groups.\nThis psychoeducational group intervention significantly improved QoL and patient satisfaction but not symptom burden in adult patients with ADHD. Future studies should explore the long-term effects of psychoeducational group programs and examine ways to optimize treatment outcomes.\nClinicalTrials.gov NCT03337425, 06/11/2017.",

        "abstract": "Irritability is one of the most frequent concerns in pediatric mental health and a predictor of long-term psychopathology and burden. This article aims to provide a comprehensive review of non-episodic irritability along with evidence-based clinical recommendations for pediatric care professionals.\nA narrative review was conducted based on the literature from the last 10 years and additional key studies. Observational studies, randomized controlled trials, systematic reviews, and meta-analyses were considered.\nNon-episodic irritability is a transdiagnostic construct associated with several mental disorders. Research on etiological pathways suggests that irritability may involve distinct mechanisms, moderate heritability, and genetic associations with attention-deficit and hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and depression. Clinical manifestations vary across different developmental stages, and distinguishing pathological from normative irritability may be challenging. Although there is no gold-standard measure, validated instruments are available. Despite recent advances, evidence-based treatment remains limited. Evidence supports psychosocial interventions that integrate parent- and child-focused components, as well as the use of stimulants for patients with comorbid ADHD. Antipsychotics are effective in reducing irritability in children with autism spectrum disorder. However, its use requires caution in non-autistic youth with irritability without a diagnosable disorder or with oppositional defiant disorder due to inconclusive efficacy and potential adverse effects.\nAlthough publications on non-episodic irritability have increased, the evidence remains relatively nascent. Further research is needed to advance the knowledge on underlying mechanisms, enhance clinical recognition, identify effective interventions, and support the development of new treatments, ensuring that irritability is adequately addressed in clinical practice.",

        "abstract": "Insomnia and psychiatric disorders exhibit frequent comorbidity and heritability, yet their shared genetic architecture and neurobiological mechanisms remain unclear. This study investigated genetic overlap, pathways, and brain cell types linking insomnia with 12 psychiatric disorders using genome-wide association study (GWAS) data (insomnia: Neff = 314,149; psychiatric disorders: Neff = 12,783 - 449,855). Significant genetic correlations were identified between insomnia and seven psychiatric conditions: attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), anorexia nervosa (AN), anxiety (ANX), autism spectrum disorder (ASD), bipolar disorder (BD), major depression (MD), and schizophrenia (SCZ). Cross-trait analyses revealed 70 shared loci (97 candidate SNPs), including novel associations: 7 with ADHD, 6 with AN, 3 with ANX, 3 with ASD, 5 with BD, 15 with MD, and 19 with SCZ. Pathway enrichment highlighted GABAergic synapse signaling as a key mechanism underlying these comorbidities. Single-cell RNA sequencing analysis of 36 brain cell types implicated eight cortical neuron subtypes: four GABAergic interneurons and four glutamatergic neurons. Among 71 genes mapped to shared loci, 33 exhibited significant expression in these cell types, with 12 prioritized as potential therapeutic targets. These findings underscore shared genetic foundations between insomnia and psychiatric disorders, centered on cortical GABA-glutamate circuitry, and identify candidate pathways for mitigating comorbid conditions. This integrative approach bridges genetic epidemiology with neurobiology, offering insights into transdiagnostic mechanisms and precision treatment strategies.",

A rodent model for studying ADHD should demonstrate similarities to the disorder by mimicking its three core symptoms (face validity), should align with a theoretically justified pathophysiological basis (construct validity), and should provide insights into unknown aspects of ADHD neurobiology while offering potential new treatments (predictive validity). This review provides an overview of rodent research models, which vary in their pathophysiological alterations, ability to replicate behavioural symptoms, and response to pharmacological treatments. Given this heterogeneity, it remains challenging to determine which rodent model best represents ADHD or its different subtypes. Consequently, validating these models against contemporary medication therapies and testing candidate natural compounds as potential adjuvant treatments is essential. Additionally, combining models induced by neurotoxins, environmental substances, and genetic modifications may help evaluate potential interactions and their impact on ADHD development.",

It also emphasizes the possible management of the disorder. This knowledge will be essential for developing therapeutic interventions and prevention measures.\nADHD is a neurodevelopmental psychiatric disorder, characterized by pervasive patterns of inattention, hyperactivity, or impulsivity. Globally, it affects up to 7-10% of elementary school children, and symptoms frequently persist into adulthood. Among adults, 2-5% experience ADHD symptoms worldwide. The aetiology and developmental trajectory of the disorder remain unknown. ADHD is caused by a combination of genetic, psychological, physiological, biochemical, and environmental factors. All of these factors are thought to permanently change the development of the dopaminergic and noradrenergic system, which is a fundamental neurobiological mechanism behind the disorder.\nUntreated ADHD can have long-term effects on individuals throughout their lifetime and cause adverse life trajectories such as poor educational and occupational outcomes, substance addiction, accidents, suicide, criminal activity, and co-occurring mental and physical health disorders. Principal management options include psychopharmacological treatments such as group cognitive behavioural therapy and social skills training, parent education programmes, and school-based initiatives, as well as medication employing stimulants and non-stimulants.",

        "abstract": "Sensory over-responsivity (SOR), characterized by strong negative reactions to typically innocuous stimuli, is considered a symptom of autism spectrum disorder. However, SOR also affects 15-20% of children overall, including a majority of children with common psychiatric conditions. Despite its prevalence, the clinical specificity and neurobiological bases of SOR remain poorly understood. Our study aims to determine the specific clinical significance of SOR across diverse child samples and establish whether SOR is associated with distinct patterns of functional connectivity (FC).\nWe analyzed data from 15,728 children (ages 6-17.9 years) across five datasets: three community samples, including the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development [ABCD] and Healthy Brain Network [HBN] studies, and two autism-enriched samples. Bivariate and multivariate models examined associations between SOR and symptoms of anxiety, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, depression, conduct disorder, and oppositional defiant disorder, as well as autistic traits. Analysis of resting-state functional MRI (fMRI) data from the ABCD study tested brain-wide and circuit-specific FC correlates of mild SOR, replication of effects in an independent ABCD subsample, as well as extension to severe SOR in ABCD.\nMultivariate analyses revealed that SOR is associated with a remarkably consistent transdiagnostic profile: greater levels of both autistic traits and anxiety symptoms and, in community samples, lower levels of conduct disorder symptoms. Across samples, SOR is not reliably associated with symptoms of any other analyzed psychiatric conditions. SOR is associated with both brain-wide and circuit-specific resting-state functional connectivity (FC) patterns that replicate across independent subsamples and highlight FC differences between cingulo-parietal network and bilateral caudate nucleus.\nOur results demonstrate that SOR may constitute a transdiagnostic latent trait with both specific clinical risk and protection, and with replicable neural correlates that implicate specific cortico-subcortical circuits. These findings advance our understanding of the neurobiology and clinical relevance of SOR. They may also inform clinical practice and future research aimed at understanding and supporting individuals with sensory challenges.",

        "abstract": "Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) was once thought to be solely a childhood condition. Now it is well established that it can persist into adulthood, with an estimated worldwide prevalence of around 2.5%. Additionally, up to 70% of individuals with childhood-onset ADHD continue to experience impairing symptoms as adults, even if they no longer meet the criteria for a formal diagnosis. The validity of adult ADHD initially faced strong criticism. Today, empirical research supports its descriptive validity (identifying characteristic signs and symptoms), predictive validity (concerning specific outcomes, courses, and responses to treatment), and concurrent validity (evidence related to its underlying causes and biological mechanisms). Despite this progress, unresolved questions and ongoing debates about adult ADHD persist. This paper summarizes current empirical evidence, alongside uncertainties and controversies, regarding the definition, epidemiology, diagnosis, etiology, neurobiology, and management of ADHD in adults. Crucially, we also include perspectives from individuals with lived experience of this condition, highlighting their views on unmet needs and priorities for improving care. Key uncertainties and controversies on adult ADHD include: a) the possibility of late-onset ADHD; b) the significance of emotional dysregulation as a core symptom; c) the definition and characterization of functional impairment; d) the persistence of comorbid psychiatric and somatic conditions after accounting for confounders; e) the relevance of executive dysfunction in the definition of the condition; f) the use of objective diagnostic measures; g) the long-term effects of treatments; and h) the role of non-pharmacological interventions. Further research on adult ADHD is urgently needed. Funding for studies on this condition lags behind that for childhood ADHD and other mental disorders in adulthood. Hopefully, efforts by clinicians, researchers and other stakeholders will ultimately help ensure that adults with ADHD are better understood, supported, and empowered to thrive.",

Roles for dopamine and norepinephrine are widely recognized; however, the role of serotonergic neurotransmission is less clear. This systematic literature review aimed to determine if changes in serotonin transmission are implicated in the neurobiology of ADHD.\nA search of published literature was conducted. Eligible publications addressing the role of serotonin, its receptor family, and/or its transporter in the neurobiology of ADHD were selected according to prespecified criteria. The quality of evidence was graded.\nOf 95 publications meeting our criteria, many (\nSubstantial evidence implicates serotonin in the neurobiology of ADHD and in the regulation of the catecholaminergic systems believed to be dysregulated by the disorder. Yet this evidence is incomplete and, at times, conflicting. It does suggest, however, that medications that engage the serotonin system should be tested for their efficacy in the treatment of ADHD.\nAttention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common disorder. Individuals with ADHD can have symptoms of inattention, impulsivity, and hyperactivity, and often need medication to help with behavior, address deficits at school or work, and avoid the many life impairments associated with the disorder. ADHD can occur from genetic alterations or environmental factors which can cause changes in the brain. Chemicals in the brain called neurotransmitters carry messages, and one neurotransmitter, called serotonin, may be an important factor in ADHD. To address this issue, we (1) searched published scientific articles about the role of serotonin in ADHD, (2) cataloged the types of evidence (for example, did it come from humans with ADHD or from animal models), and (3) identified how strong the evidence was. This search found 95 articles that looked at the potential link between serotonin and ADHD, of which 77 (81%) supported a role for serotonin. A full understanding of all processes involved in ADHD is not yet known, but overall, this study confirms that serotonin is likely to be involved in ADHD, making it a good target for future medications to help manage the symptoms.",

Current treatments are moderately effective, partly due to the large heterogeneity in SUDs, including co-occurring psychopathology. A better understanding of the mechanisms underlying these frequently co-occurring psychiatric conditions is required to develop individualized treatments to increase treatment success rates. We systematically reviewed case-control studies investigating neurobiological differences measured using neuroimaging between participants with SUD only and participants with SUD and co-occurring psychiatric disorders. We searched articles in four databases. Inclusion criteria further existed of an ICD and/or DSM diagnoses based on interview assessment or Fagerstr\u00f6m test for Nicotine Dependence scores \u2265\u202f5. We hypothesised that co-occurring psychopathology could (1) amplify the neurobiological effects of SUD, (2) attenuate it, (3) have unique neurobiological effects, or (4) have no additional neurobiological effects. From 10,076 unique records screened, we included a total of 26 articles investigating the effect of personality disorder cluster B and/or C (6), depression (4), PTSD (4), ADHD (4), schizophrenia (8), bipolar disorder (1) or anxiety disorders (1) on SUD. We found amplifying effects of co-occurring schizophrenia and personality disorder, unique effects of schizophrenia, ADHD and personality disorder, and attenuating or no effect of depression on SUD. Findings on PTSD were contradictory. In conclusion, different co-occurring psychiatric disorder have distinct effects on the neurobiology of SUD.",

        "abstract": "Psychiatric conditions share common genes, but mechanisms that differentiate diagnoses remain unclear. We present a multidimensional framework for functional analysis of rare copy number variants (CNVs) across 6 diagnostic categories, including schizophrenia (SCZ), autism (ASD), bipolar disorder (BD), depression (MDD), PTSD, and ADHD (N = 574,965). Using gene-set burden analysis (GSBA), we tested duplication (DUP) and deletion (DEL) burden across 2,645 functional gene sets defined by the intersections of pathways, cell types, and cortical regions. While diagnoses converge on shared pathways, mixed-effects modeling revealed divergence of pathway effects by cell type, brain region, and gene dosage. Factor analysis identified latent dimensions aligned with clinical axes. A primary factor (F1) captured reciprocal dose-dependent effects of DUP and DEL in SCZ reflecting positive and negative effects in excitatory versus inhibitory neurons and association versus sensory cortex. SCZ and ASD were both strongly aligned with F1 but with opposing directionalities. Orthogonal factors highlighted neuronal versus non-neuronal effects in mood disorders (F2) and differential spatial distributions of DEL effects in ADHD and MDD (F3). High-impact CNVs at 16p11.2 and 22q11.2 were enriched for combinations of cell-type-specific genes involved in pathways consistent with our broader findings. These results reveal molecular and cellular mechanisms that are broadly shared across psychiatric traits but differ between diagnostic categories in context and directionality.",

        "abstract": "The prevalence of mental disorders is increasing across the European Union, with at least one in four individuals expected to experience a psychiatric condition at some point in their lifetime. Notably, men and women often present with distinct symptomatology. Among neuropsychiatric disorders, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is the most common and functionally impairing condition in childhood, affecting approximately 5% of minors. Its persistence into adulthood is substantial, with prevalence estimates reaching up to 3% in adult populations. ADHD is characterized by dysregulated dopaminergic signaling, which disrupts reward processing and motivation. Additionally, disturbances in circadian rhythms contribute to sleep dysregulation and metabolic dysfunction, further exacerbating symptom severity. While both mechanisms have been well-documented, their interaction remains insufficiently explored, particularly regarding its implications for diagnosis and treatment optimization. Future research should systematically examine the interplay between dopaminergic and noradrenergic dysfunction and circadian disruptions in ADHD, particularly in relation to symptom expression and comorbid conditions. Experimental paradigms assessing reward processing may provide valuable insights into dopamine and norepinephrine system alterations, while chronotherapeutic interventions-such as light therapy, sleep regulation, and behavioral adjustments-hold promise as potential therapeutic strategies. By integrating perspectives from neurobiology, chronobiology, and psychopharmacology, a more refined and individualized approach to ADHD management can be developed. Advancing this understanding may not only enhance ADHD treatment strategies but also yield novel therapeutic avenues for addressing its frequently co-occurring conditions.",

        "abstract": "Academic underachievement is often reported in children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Research shows working memory (WM), and processing speed (PS) have a predictive role in their academic difficulties. Recent evidence suggests both cognitive functions are related, where slower PS underlies WM deficits. This relationship is not accounted for in the current literature on academic underachievement in children with ADHD. In the current study, the role of PS and WM in the association between ADHD symptom severity and academic achievement is investigated in a sample of 504, 6 to 12 years old children diagnosed with ADHD. Academic achievement is assessed across three subjects (mathematics, reading and spelling), by three measurement methods (standardized tests, parent, and teacher ratings). In addition, the role of PS is investigated in the relationship between ADHD symptom severity and WM. Findings show the association between inattention symptom severity and achievement on all three academic subjects is statistically mediated by PS and WM sequentially. For mathematics and spelling performance, PS was a single mediator in this association. Further, PS statistically mediated the relation between inattention symptom severity and WM performance. Hyperactivity/impulsivity symptom severity predicted mathematics performance directly, but none of the indirect effects were significant. The current results show that PS plays an important role in the academic achievement of children with increased inattention symptoms, as well as the WM deficits often reported in this population. These findings have important implications for theoretical accounts of ADHD, as well as academic interventions, currently focusing primarily on WM deficits.",

        "doi": "10.1002/jdn.70028",
        "abstract": "In developmental-age kids with specific-learning-disabilities (SLD), functional illiteracy entails poor logical reasoning; in those with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), a deficit in prospective memory results in difficulty executing previously planned actions. We model this SLD and/or ADHD construct in the rat via the signalled-licking/avoidance-of-punishment protocol (SLAP): We aim to study to assess rats' ability to merge two independently learned notions (one Pavlovian and one instrumental) and their deliberate exploitation. Rats were tested in Skinner boxes with a water-dispenser and lickometer. The 'Flash' paradigm consists of 30-min daily sessions, in which 5-min safe phases (i.e., sound and light off, signalled free-drinking) are intertwined by 1-min unsafe phases (i.e., sound and light on). If subjects drink during unsafe phases, a mild footshock is released: Rats learn to withhold drinking. The 'Allow' paradigm starts and stays in the unsafe phase. Rats can shift to a 2-min safe phase through a single nose poke in the active-hole. The possibility to exert control over the environment, via seeking dark-and-silence (the predictive contingencies) as deliberate goal, is an unexplored construct in rats. In data from the 'Flash' paradigm, a greater number of licks/h during safe phases is confirming that rats easily understand classical passive-avoidance contingencies. Findings from the 'Allow' paradigm indicate increased inefficacious nose pokes/h during safe phases, compared to unsafe ones. This is clearly suggesting that rats associate the change of phase with an outcome of their own input into the active nose-poking device. However, rats do not understand the 'potential' for instrumental exploitation of their nose pokes. As such, no significant inferences were drawn across the two independent associative notions. Neurobiology of this putative 'insight' capability may rely on limbic-striatal-cortical networks. Impairments in the latter may be involved in deficits of prospective memory (in ADHD), and/or impairments in logic skills (in SLD). The SLAP protocol may offer insights on basic neurobiology as well as modulatory effects thereon of pharmacological molecules.",

The average grade of serotonergic evidence was calculated and plotted alongside the volume of publications for each identified comorbidity. The date of the last search was 7 March 2024.\nOne hundred eighty-two individual comorbidities commonly occurring in ADHD populations were identified; 135 (74.2\u202f%) had evidence for serotonergic pathophysiology, including 91 psychiatric and 44 somatic conditions. The grade of evidence for a serotonergic role in the pathophysiology of a given comorbidity was generally medium to high or high.\nFindings indicate that serotonin plays a key role, alongside dopamine and norepinephrine, in ADHD neurobiology. Serotonin involvement in physiological functioning suggests that dysregulation is likely to generate a broad spectrum of clinical manifestations, which may account for the unique presentation of neuropsychiatric behaviors and comorbidities found in patients with ADHD.",

        "abstract": "Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by impairments in executive functions, including behavioral inhibition and working memory. The most widely accepted neurobiological explanation for ADHD is related to dopaminergic hypofunction. The dopaminergic system is modulated by endocannabinoid ligands, primarily through the action of cannabinoid receptors type 1 and 2 (CB1R and CB2R) within frontostriatal circuits. Spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) are a widely used animal model for studying the neurobiology of ADHD. Our recent study demonstrated that acute treatment with synthetic CB1R and CB2R ligands increased hyperactivity and risk-taking behavior in SHR. We now investigate how chronic modulation of these receptors affects hyperactivity, risk-taking behavior, and working memory assessment in SHR. As expected, the SHR exhibited hyperactivity, difficulties in risk assessment, impaired working memory, and increased risk-taking behavior. Notably, females SHR displayed higher levels of locomotion and risk-taking behavior than their male counterparts, regardless of treatment. Chronic modulation of CB1R and CB2R did not lead to significant changes in any of the evaluated behavioral parameters. Further research is needed to understand both the acute and chronic effects of manipulating cannabinoid receptors and endocannabinoids in the context of ADHD.",

        "abstract": "ADHD, or Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder, is a neurodevelopmental disorder that is known for its high degree of heterogeneity. It often coexists with other psychiatric diseases, especially anxiety and depression. This article reviews recent studies to explore the etiology of comorbid anxiety and depressive disorders in adults with ADHD, analyzing the factors contributing to this elevated comorbidity rate from several perspectives. Additionally, we explore potential directions for future research in this field.\nADHD exhibits a high comorbidity rate with anxiety and depressive disorders, due to overlapping and interacting symptoms. Individuals with two or more comorbid conditions often experience increased disease burden, prolonged illness duration, and diminished treatment efficacy. The underlying causes of comorbid anxiety and depression in ADHD patients are highly complex and can be understood from multiple dimensions, including genetics, neurobiology, neurocognition, and neuroimaging. This complexity poses significant challenges for clinical diagnosis and treatment. Currently, the management of ADHD patients with concurrent depression or anxiety may involve pharmaceutical interventions combined with non-pharmacological strategies, including psychotherapy (e.g., cognitive-behavioral therapy, CBT) and digital therapeutics. For patients with comorbid illnesses, these intergrated approaches have demonstrated significant improvements in symptom relief and quality of life enhancement.\nADHD is a highly heterogeneous disorder with a significant comorbidity rate. Recent research has elucidated the pathogenetic mechanisms of ADHD comorbid with depression and anxiety disorders from multiple perspectives. To improve patient functioning, enhance their quality of life, and guide more effective treatments, Further studies are needed to investigate the underlying causes of these comorbid conditions.",

Recent studies have proposed that gene expression involved in regulating synaptic transmission in the striatum may play a role in ADHD pathogenesis. To explore the molecular basis\u00a0of ADHD, we utilized proteomic analysis using whole striatal tissues from early adult thyroid hormone-responsive protein-overexpressing (THRSP-OE) mice, which displayed defining characteristics of predominantly inattentive ADHD (ADHD-PI). We focused on the striatal brain region due to its critical role in the regulation of attention, motivation, and reward processing. Moreover, the striatum modulates dopaminergic pathways that are known to be impaired in ADHD. Our analysis revealed an innate overexpression of Snap25 protein in THRSP-OE mice,\u00a0indicating\u00a0possible alterations in the SNARE protein complex and potential neurotransmitter dysregulation. Furthermore, a binding affinity study showed reduced dopamine D1 receptor binding concentrations and pronounced low dopamine levels in THRSP-OE mice. Repeated seven-day injections of methylphenidate improved the low dopamine levels, reducing the EEG theta/beta ratio in this animal model. These findings suggest new markers specific to the ADHD-PI presentation and further support the role of Snap25 dysregulation and possible SNARE protein complex alterations in ADHD-PI.",

Imaging studies have yielded varied results, and it is now clear that there is unlikely to be one characteristic neuroanatomical profile of either condition. Parsing this heterogeneity could allow us to identify more homogeneous subgroups, either within or across conditions, which may be more clinically informative. This has been a pivotal goal for neurodevelopmental research using both clinical and neuroanatomical features, though results thus far have again been inconsistent with regards to the number and characteristics of subgroups.\nHere, we use population modelling to cluster a multi-site dataset based on global and regional centile scores of cortical thickness, surface area and grey matter volume. We use HYDRA, a novel semi-supervised machine learning algorithm which clusters based on differences to controls and compare its performance to a traditional clustering approach.\nWe identified distinct subgroups within autism and ADHD, as well as across diagnosis, often with opposite neuroanatomical alterations relatively to controls. These subgroups were characterised by different combinations of increased or decreased patterns of morphometrics. We did not find significant clinical differences across subgroups.\nCrucially, however, the number of subgroups and their membership differed vastly depending on chosen features and the algorithm used, highlighting the impact and importance of careful method selection.\nWe highlight the importance of examining heterogeneity in autism and ADHD and demonstrate that population modelling is a useful tool to study subgrouping in autism and ADHD. We identified subgroups with distinct patterns of alterations relative to controls but note that these results rely heavily on the algorithm used and encourage detailed reporting of methods and features used in future studies.",

        "abstract": "Attention Deficit-Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder with a prevalence around 5% in children and adolescents and 2.5% in adults. Recent reports using GWAS approaches have identified several genetic risk loci for this disorder. However, the epigenetic influence of extrinsic factors during pregnancy or the exposure to environmental factors during childhood, on the onset of the disorder remains unclear. This question has been addressed by analyzing blood or saliva samples from ADHD patients or by postmortem analysis. The aim of this study was to determine differential patterns in DNA methylation in fresh hippocampal samples using a murine model of ADHD. We analyzed the genome-wide pattern of differentially methylated CpG sites using the Illumina Infinium Mouse Methylation BeadChip in fresh hippocampal samples from the prenatal nicotine exposure (PNE) mouse model of ADHD and control animals. Our analysis revealed 218 DMPs including genes associated with growth factors signaling, such as adhesion G protein-coupled receptor B2 (ADGRB2), leukemia inhibitory factor receptor (LIFR) and erb-b2 receptor tyrosine kinase 3 (ERBB3) involved in synaptogenesis, proliferation, and differentiation of neural stem cells. The functional gene enrichment analysis of differentially methylated positions (DMPs) revealed the nervous system development as the biological process with highest enrichment factor. In addition, the GO and KEEG enrichment analysis of 113 differentially methylated regions (DMR) revealed several loci associated with the positive regulation of Hippo signaling (involved in neuronal development) in PNE samples. In addition, our results revealed a DMP previously associated to ADHD patients supporting the PNE murine model of ADHD. These results are relevant in terms of the validation of PNE model of ADHD and for the identification of epigenetic markers of the disorder in humans. In addition, our results are relevant for the characterization of the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the ADHD, currently unknown.",

        "doi": "10.1093/brain/awaf203",
        "abstract": "Fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) is a late-onset neurodegenerative disorder caused by a preCGG repeat expansion in FMR1. Individuals with the FMR1 premutation often exhibit neuropsychiatric symptoms before FXTAS onset, leading to the identification of fragile X-associated neuropsychiatric disorders. Rodent models of FXTAS show motor impairments, pathological intranuclear inclusions and heightened anxiety. However, the early onset of neuropsychiatric features and underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. To address the above issues, we used the doxycycline-inducible 90CGG mouse model, with transgene activation at two developmental stages: adolescence and young adulthood. Mice were evaluated in a behavioural battery to assess anxiety-like behaviour, exploration, and motor coordination and learning. Next, we conducted a combination of ex vivo extracellular local field potential recordings to measure synaptic physiology and oscillatory activity in the limbic system, particularly in the basolateral amygdala (BLA) and ventral hippocampus (vH) regions. Parvalbumin interneurons and intranuclear inclusions in the amygdala and hippocampus were investigated by immunofluorescence, and mass spectrometry and gene set enrichment were used to identify differentially expressed protein molecular pathways. Adolescent 90CGG mice displayed early-onset hyperactivity, transitioning to heightened anxiety in young adulthood, coinciding with the accumulation of intranuclear inclusions in the BLA and vH. Electrophysiological analysis revealed augmented gamma oscillations in the vH, emerging during adolescence and persisting in young adulthood. These changes were correlated with a reduction in parvalbumin interneurons in these regions, and together probably contribute to enhanced BLA excitability and impaired vH plasticity. Finally, proteomic analysis of the vH revealed altered proteins linked to attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in adolescence and anxiety/depression in adulthood, aligning well with behavioural findings. Importantly, these behavioural, electrophysiological and cellular alterations were reversible upon transgene inactivation. This study reveals a temporal progression of CGG premutation effects on behaviour, from hyperactivity to heightened anxiety to late-onset motor dysfunction. Moreover, these findings provide altered network activity in the limbic system as a putative mechanism in neuropsychiatric features of premutation carriers.",

        "abstract": "Aberrant dopamine (DA) signaling is implicated in schizophrenia, bipolar disorder (BPD), autism spectrum disorder (ASD), substance use disorder, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Treatment of these disorders remains inadequate, as exemplified by the therapeutic use of d-amphetamine and methylphenidate for the treatment of ADHD, agents with high abuse liability. In search for an improved and non-addictive therapeutic approach for the treatment of DA-linked disorders, we utilized a preclinical mouse model expressing the human DA transporter (DAT) coding variant DAT Val559, previously identified in individuals with ADHD, ASD, or BPD. DAT Val559, like several other disease-associated variants of DAT, exhibits anomalous DA efflux (ADE) that can be blocked by d-amphetamine and methylphenidate. Kappa opioid receptors (KORs) are expressed by DA neurons and modulate DA release and clearance, suggesting that targeting KORs might also provide an alternative approach to normalizing DA-signaling disrupted by perturbed DAT function. Here we demonstrate that KOR stimulation leads to enhanced surface trafficking and phosphorylation of Thr53 in wildtype DAT, effects achieved constitutively by the Val559 mutant. Moreover, these effects can be rescued by KOR antagonism of DAT Val559 in ex vivo preparations. Importantly, KOR antagonism also corrected in vivo DA release as well as sex-dependent behavioral abnormalities observed in DAT Val559 mice. Given their low abuse liability, our studies with a construct valid model of human DA associated disorders reinforce considerations of KOR antagonism as a pharmacological strategy to treat DA associated brain disorders.",

        "abstract": "Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), the most prevalent neurodevelopmental disorder, is characterized by inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity, manifesting in distinct symptoms and varying degrees of severity among patients. While the cellular processes underlying the neurobiology of ADHD are still being explored, in vitro studies suggest the involvement of certain cellular pathways in its clinical manifestations. Neurodevelopmental disorders such as ADHD are caused by malfunctions in numerous cells in the central nervous system (CNS) throughout development; nevertheless, most of the research focuses on neuronal dysfunction. In the last decade, it has become evident that glia and astrocytes play a crucial role in neurodevelopmental processes, which, if deficient, may result in neurodevelopmental disorders. Besides contributing to homeostatic maintenance of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and other glial cell types, astrocytes provide neurons with structural, trophic, and metabolic support, which is indispensable for their proper functionality. Emerging evidence implicates that astrocytes are involved in processes associated with the etiopathology of ADHD, including oxidative stress, aberrant synaptic formation, neuroinflammation, and excitatory/inhibitory imbalance. This review will summarize the current knowledge addressing astrocyte dysfunction in ADHD, the remaining caveats in clinical data, and the possibilities for drug therapy. Findings substantiated by in vivo, in vitro, and genetic data will be provided, along with the impact of methylphenidate on astrocyte condition.",

        "abstract": "The clinical efficacy of psychostimulant drugs, which target monoamine transporters, in treating attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorders (ADHDs) has stimulated interest on the role of transporter proteins like the dopamine\u00a0(DA) transporter (DAT) in neurotransmission as well as the potential utility of DAT knockout organisms as models for neuropsychiatric disorders. Indeed, the study of DAT-deficient worms, flies, fish, mice, and rats has revealed a conserved role for DAT in the control of motor behavior as well as repetitive behavior, threat aversion, social behavior, and cognition in mammals. However, the disconnect between phenotypes observed in DAT-deficient model organisms and humans, which exhibit an early-onset syndrome characterized by Parkinsonism/dystonia and premature death, challenges the construct validity of DAT knockout models with respect to modeling neurobehavioral disorders. As an alternate approach, several groups have utilized coding variants in the SLC6A3 gene\u00a0linked to psychiatric conditions, which display divergent molecular phenotypes. This chapter reviews the development and characterization of models of DAT gene deletion and mutation with a particular emphasis on comparing/contrasting the functional impact of DAT deficiency to DAT dysregulation triggered by neuropsychiatric disorder-linked DAT mutants in vivo. Ultimately, the study of DAT knockout and mutant models has revealed novel functions for DA in the mammalian brain, uncovered a dynamic interplay between the monoaminergic systems, highlighted sex differences in the DA system that determine the behavioral trajectory of DAT deregulation, and allowed for the screening of potential leads for therapeutics to treat disorders linked to aberrant dopaminergic neurotransmission.",

        "abstract": "Drosophila melanogaster, commonly referred to as the \"fruit fly,\" has been a long-utilized animal model in multiple areas of biological research. It is estimated that 75% of human genes, which are associated with disease, have homologues in Drosophila. The conservation of biological systems, the genetic tractability, short generation time, and a broad array of available behavioral assessments make Drosophila an especially robust model organism for neuroscience investigations. The dopamine (DA) system, in particular, is highly conserved between mammals and Drosophila. Mutations of the DA transporter (DAT), a negative regulator of DA neurotransmission, have been associated with multiple different neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders, including autism spectrum disorders (ASDs), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and Parkinson's disease (PD). Utilization of Drosophila models demonstrates specific structural and functional alterations in mutated DAT that manifest as unique behavioral phenotypes. Ultimately, combining techniques ranging from biochemistry, electrochemistry, and complex behavioral analyses facilitated a deeper understanding of how transporter function and dysfunction can translate to neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders.",

        "abstract": "A growing body of research indicates that paternal exposure to adverse environments can result in genetic toxicity in the offspring. Nevertheless, the consequences of paternal preconception exposure to reserpine or antidepressant medications (venlafaxine alone, crocin alone, or a combination of venlafaxine and crocin) on offspring health remain uninvestigated. The present study elucidates the effects of paternal preconception in a depressed state or exposure to antidepressants on offspring development and motor behavior. In this study, a deep learning Twin Network was employed to accurately stage F1 generation embryos and objectively quantify the developmental tempo. EmbryoNet was employed to predict developmental abnormalities signals (shh, nodal, bmp) in the F1 generation embryos, those associated with the dopamine pathway. Furthermore, dopamine is linked to motor behavior. The behavioral results suggest the presence of ADHD-like behaviors in the F1 generation of paternally exposed reserpine. It is generally accepted that genotoxicity is usually accompanied by ROS production. In conclusion, the deep learning approach employed in this study allows for the early prediction of abnormal signals and early screening and diagnosis. This study makes a valuable contribution to the safety assessment of antidepressant drugs, providing a cautionary role for the intake of antidepressants and paternal inheritance.",

        "abstract": "Lisdexamfetamine (LDX), a prodrug of d-amphetamine, is widely used in the pharmacological treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders such as attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and binge eating disorder (BED). Chemically, it consists of the amino acid lysine linked to d-amphetamine. Its enzymatic conversion to d-amphetamine sets the stage for a prolonged and controlled release, influencing its clinical profile and differentiating it from other stimulant medications. As a central nervous system stimulant, LDX primarily acts by increasing the release of neurotransmitters, particularly dopamine and noradrenaline, in the brain. Clinically, this enhanced availability of neurotransmitters is believed to contribute to improvements in attention, focus and impulse control in individuals with ADHD. The side effects of LDX include insomnia, decreased appetite, weight loss and xerostomia. This work reviews the pharmacological mechanisms, clinical applications and forensic considerations associated with its use. It is expected that clinicians, researchers and policymakers have a comprehensive understanding of the pharmacological and toxicological aspects of LDX.",

        "abstract": "Dopamine (DA) plays a vital role in mood, alertness, and behavior, with dysregulation linked to disorders such as Parkinson's disease, ADHD, depression, and addiction. In this study, we develop and analyze a reduced mathematical model of dopamine synthesis, release, and reuptake to investigate how daily rhythms influence dopamine dynamics and the efficacy of dopamine reuptake inhibitors (DRIs) used in the treatment of various neuropsychiatric conditions. We simplify a detailed mathematical model of dopamine synthesis, release, and reuptake and demonstrate that our reduced system maintains key dynamical features including homeostatic regulation via autoreceptors. Our model captures core autoregulatory mechanisms and reveals that DRIs can exert substantial time-of-day effects, allowing for dopamine levels to be sustained at elevated levels when administered at circadian troughs. These fluctuations depend sensitively on the timing of DRI administration relative to circadian variations in enzyme activity. We further extend the model to incorporate feedback from local dopaminergic tone, which generates ultradian oscillations in the model independent of circadian regulation. Administration of DRIs lengthens the ultradian periodicity. Our findings provide strong evidence that intrinsic fluctuations in DA should be considered in the clinical use of DRIs, offering a mechanistic framework for improving chronotherapeutic strategies targeting dopaminergic dysfunction.",

        "abstract": "Stimulant medications, such as methylphenidate and amphetamine derivatives, and non-stimulant medications, such as atomoxetine, guanfacine, clonidine, and viloxazine, are considered the cornerstones of pharmacological treatment for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). However, a significant number of individuals respond partially to these treatments or are concerned about side effects. This creates a need for new treatment strategies that target alternative neurobiological mechanisms and offer improved tolerability and efficacy profiles.\nThis review examines pharmacological agents currently in phase III clinical development or recently completed trials for the treatment of ADHD. We highlight four promising candidates: centanafadine, solriamfetol, CTx-1301, and NRCT-101SR. We discuss their pharmacological mechanisms, clinical efficacy, safety profiles, and regulatory status, with an emphasis on how these agents may address existing therapeutic gaps and the potential clinical implications. A literature search was conducted using PubMed and ClinicalTrials.gov databases for articles published between January 2018-July 2025.\nRecent advances in ADHD pharmacotherapy suggest that approaches targeting monoaminergic systems beyond dopamine and noradrenaline reuptake inhibition may provide therapeutic benefits. Additionally, multi-phase extended-release formulations may improve adherence and enhance symptom control throughout the day. As phase III data become available, these agents have the potential to redefine ADHD treatment paradigms.",

        "abstract": "Movement and behavioral disturbances occur due to imbalances in neurotransmitter receptor/ligand activities and manifest in the form of basal ganglia- and limbic-related diseases. Diseases in the two systems are all characterized, but there are still complexities and controversies regarding the implication of neural circuits in the pathophysiology of neurological diseases. Thus, we aimed to illustrate the mechanistic backbone of neurotransmitter activities in neural circuits for the sake of better clarification of such diseases and their possible application as a map for the development of new drugs or novel treatment modalities, particularly considering the overlapping circuits for some disorders. The neural circuits unveil hypoactivity of the mesostriatal pathway as a key characteristic of Parkinson's disease (PD), while disturbances in mesocortical and mesolimbic circuits define schizophrenia pathophysiology. Medium spiny neurons (MSNs) within the striatum take direct and indirect neuronal pathways and express D1 and D2 receptors to finally stimulate the cortical activity. Selective neuronal loss in the striatal indirect pathway defines Huntington's disease (HD). HD and hemiballismus (HB) display subthalamus nucleus (STN) deactivation and the subsequent removal of the subthalamus stimulatory effect on the pallidum. Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) evolves due to dysregulations in prefrontal cortex (PFC)-related dopaminergic, norepinephrine (NE), and acetylcholine (Ach) neurons and in the PFC control over amygdala (misery-feeling; low serotonin and imbalanced gamma-aminobutyric acid [GABA]-glutamate [Glu]), with the latter also accountng for increasing fear response in chronic stress and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and evolving depression phase in bipolar disorder (BD).

Key sphingolipid metabolic enzymes were assessed by RT-qPCR and Western blot, while sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) levels were quantified via ELISA. ADHD model rats received intraperitoneal administration of SPHK inhibitor SKI II (15 mg/kg, 16 days). Behavioral tests evaluated hyperactivity, impulsivity, and anxiety-like phenotypes. Western blot analyzed expression of dopamine synthesis rate-limiting enzyme.\nThe ADHD model group exhibited significantly elevated ganglioside and lysophospholipid levels. taVNS intervention specifically reduced sphingomyelin content. SPHK1 and SPHK2 mRNA and protein expression were markedly upregulated in ADHD models, concomitant with increased S1P levels. taVNS selectively decreased \nThe SPHK-S1P signaling axis is a core pathway driving sphingolipid metabolic dysregulation in the prefrontal cortex in ADHD. Targeted inhibition of this pathway synergistically modulates the expression levels of proteins associated with dopaminergic neurotransmission. The limited regulatory effect of taVNS on sphingolipid metabolism suggests its clinical benefits may stem from multi-pathway synergistic mechanisms.",

Characterized by an irresistible urge to move the legs, it is typically more pronounced in the evening and at rest. Growing Pains (GP), common in childhood and associated with migraine, present apparently overlapping symptoms with RLS, making it sometimes difficult to distinguish between the two. Understanding their relationship is important to make correct diagnosis and treatment.\nWe performed a literature review on PubMed using combinations of terms such as \"Restless Legs Syndrome,\" \"Growing Pains,\" and \"children\" to explore diagnostic criteria and the relationship between RLS and GP. Studies included those from 2000 to 2024 that involved individuals under 18 with diagnosis of RLS or GP, written in English language.\nThe 24 studies we included in our analysis showed that RLS and GP share common physiological factors, including serotonin dysfunction, iron deficiency, and low vitamin D levels. Evidence from genetic studies suggests a familial link in the development of both conditions. These findings suggest that GP might be an early form of RLS. Both conditions are linked with headaches, sleep disorders, and neuropsychiatric conditions like ADHD. Treatment for both conditions includes iron supplements, dopamine agonists, and non-medical approaches such as stretching or physical exercise. Our narrative review shows that, though distinct, RLS and GP might share common underlying causes.\nRLS and GP are common in pediatric populations, but diagnosis can be challenging due to symptom overlap. This review offers an updated and integrative framework for understanding RLS and GP, highlighting the need for more specific, evidence-based diagnostic criteria. Further research is needed in order to clarify their relationship, refine diagnostic criteria, and explore their genetic and neurobiological mechanisms.",

        "abstract": "Treatment-resistant mental health concerns significantly contribute to society in terms of financial costs and individually by creating emotional and functional costs. An important yet little-recognized cause of treatment-resistant mental health conditions is tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) deficiency. BH4 is an essential cofactor for producing serotonin, dopamine, norepinephrine, and nitric oxide-molecules critical to mood and focus. The enzyme GTP Cyclohydrolase 1 (GCH1), produced by a gene of the same name, catalyzes the first step in synthesizing BH4. Variants in this gene have been associated with low BH4 levels, as well as depression and ADHD. The case reports presented in this article illustrate that a partial BH4 deficiency, as conveyed by the ",

These disorders are frequently comorbid with disruptions in sleep rhythms, and sleep-related indicators are often used to assess disease severity and treatment efficacy. Recent evidence has highlighted the crucial roles of circadian rhythm disturbances and circadian clock gene mutations in the pathogenesis of NDDs. This review focuses on the mechanisms by which circadian rhythm disruptions and circadian clock gene mutations contribute to cognitive, behavioral, and emotional disorders associated with NDDs, particularly through the dysregulation of dopamine system. Additionally, we discussed the potential of targeting the circadian system as novel therapeutic strategies for the treatment of NDDs.",

        "abstract": "Fenvalerate (FEN) is a typical pyrethroid pesticide known for its developmental toxicity. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of gestational FEN exposure on attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)-like behaviors in weaning offspring. Pregnant mice were administered FEN daily via oral gavage throughout pregnancy. ADHD-like behaviors were assessed in weaning offspring of FEN-exposed mothers using the open-field test (OFT) and L\u00e0t maze test (LMT). Gestational FEN exposure reduced dopamine (DA) content in the striatum of weaning offspring. Further analyses revealed decreased tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), the rate-limiting enzyme in DA synthesis, in the midbrains of both fetal and weaning pups. Mechanistically, FEN exposure reduced 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) content in CpG-rich regions and specific sites within the TH gene in the fetal midbrain. Moreover, the activity of ten-eleven translocation (TET) enzymes was diminished in the fetal midbrain following FEN exposure. Supplementation with ascorbic acid (AA), a cofactor for TET enzymes, alleviated the FEN-induced reduction in 5hmC content in CpG-rich regions of TH gene in the fetal midbrain. AA supplementation also reversed the FEN-induced downregulation of midbrain TH expression and striatal DA levels in weaning offspring. Furthermore, AA supplementation rescued the FEN-induced ADHD-like behaviors in weaning offspring. These findings indicate that gestational FEN exposure induces ADHD-like behaviors in weaning offspring, partly by modifying the epigenetic regulation of DA synthesis.",

We investigated the effects of early-life exposure to polystyrene microplastics (PS-MPs; 0.1 \u03bcm and 5 \u03bcm) in zebrafish larvae (from 8\u202fh post-fertilization to 5 days post-fertilization) across a range of concentrations (0, 0.1, 10, and 100\u202f\u03bcg/mL). Larvae in most exposure groups exhibited ADHD-like behavioral phenotypes, characterized by increased locomotor activity and prolonged episodes of high-velocity movement bursts, indicative of hyperactivity and impulsivity. TH immunostaining showed a \u223c30\u202f% increase in dopaminergic neurons in larvae exposed to 0.1 \u03bcm PS-MPs (1 and 10\u202f\u03bcg/mL) compared to controls.Transcriptomic analysis further identified dysregulation of multiple dopamine-associated signaling genes. Notably, pharmacological blockade of dopamine receptors ameliorated the behavioral abnormalities. These findings demonstrate that early-life exposure to PS-MPs can perturb dopaminergic neurodevelopment and elicit ADHD-like behaviors in zebrafish, highlighting microplastics as potential environmental risk factors for neurodevelopmental disorders during critical developmental windows.",

Additionally, correlation and mediation analyses were conducted to explore the relationships between dopamine-related genes, regional brain function, and neurocognitive alterations.\nThere was a significant genetic epistasis between DRD4 and MAOA variants affecting both sReHo and dReHo in the right orbital part of the middle frontal gyrus (MFG.R), belonging to prefrontal cortex (PFC). Post-hoc pairwise analysis revealed the altered intrinsic brain connectivity related to DRD4 varied according to MAOA genotype. Furthermore, the sReHo value in MFG.R was negatively correlated with the Hyperactivity index of the Conners scale in ADHD group. Mediation analysis suggested that the relationship between the DRD4\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0MAOA gene interaction and the Hyperactivity index was mediated by the regional coherence of MFG.R in the PFC.\nThese results suggest that alterations in the dopamine system in ADHD may contribute to abnormalities in both static and dynamic local functional connectivity. Disruptions in DA homeostasis within the synaptic cleft of the prefrontal cortex could lead to changes in intrinsic regional neural coherence. Our findings may help clarify the genetic basis of dopaminergic mechanisms underlying prefrontal dysfunction in ADHD.",

        "abstract": "We used the chemogenetic tools for the activation of norepinephrine (NE) release in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) of dopamine transporter knockout (DAT-KO) rats. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of chemogenetic activation of NE release in the PFC on the performance of a spatial behavior task by DAT-KO rats. The rats DAT-KO rats with deletion of DAT gene were created as a valuable model for persistently elevated extracellular DA levels. The DAT-KO rats show marked behavioral abnormalities: impulsivity, stereotypy and reduced learning ability. Such hyperdopaminergia is thought to be one of the causes of disorders such as schizophrenia, mania and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The Locus Coeruleus (LC) is a critical area in the brain that plays an important role in control of several physiological and behavioral processes due to the existence of extensive connections to cortical and subcortical structures. Its activity can modulate both norepinephrine and dopamine neurotransmission, particularly in the PFC.\nWe used canine adenovirus type 2 (CAV2) to selectively activate LC-NA neurons in DAT-KO rats. The chemogenetic modulation of spatial learning in knockout and wild-type (WT) rats was tested in the Hebb-Williams maze. Variables such as the distance traveled, time taken to reach the goal box, number of errors and the perseverative patterns of activity were analyzed.\nNorepinephrine release from the LC to the PFC reduced hyperactive behavioral patterns in rats lacking the dopamine transporter (DAT-KO rats) with spontaneously elevated dopamine transmission. These manipulations in hyperdopaminergic mutants also caused amelioration of cognitive abnormalities in spatial learning task by decrease the perseverative activity and the number of visits to the error zones. Furthermore, chemogenetic activation of NE neurotransmission in these animals significantly improved their performance.\nThe results obtained in this study highlight an important modulatory role of NE transmission from LC to PFC on hyperactivity and cognitive dysfunctions of hyperdopaminergic DAT-KO rats lacking the dopamine transporter.",

In male SHR, 2'-FL intervention increased time spent and distance moved in Morris water maze, and upregulated mRNA expression related to \u03b3-aminobutyric acidergic, serotonergic, and noradrenergic systems in hippocampus. Increased Romboutsia, Clostridium_sensu_stricto_1, and decreased Muribaculaceae after 2'-FL intervention were associated with improved learning and spatial memory. In female SHR, synbiotic intervention reduced hyperactivity in the open field test and increased expression of tyrosine hydroxylase and dopamine transporter in striatum. Synbiotic also promoted gut microbiota diversity and suppressed the growth of Bacillus and Turicibacter. Overall, early-life 2'-FL and synbiotic interventions offered sex-specific benefits for SHR by regulating gut microbiota and mediating MGB pathways, providing new insights for prebiotics and psychobiotics in early ADHD prevention.",

Previous studies have shown that acute amphetamine has a paradoxical calming effect in DAT KO rats, but the effects of repeated amphetamine treatment are unknown.\nWe studied the effect of subchronic amphetamine on hyperdopaminergia-related disease symptoms and underlying mechanisms using male and female DAT KO rats. We measured locomotor activity, anxiety-like behaviour, social behaviour, anhedonia and problem-solving behaviour at baseline and after 10 days of amphetamine treatment and assessed protein expression changes in the glutamate system in the prefrontal cortex.\nBoth female and male DAT KO rats exhibited hyperlocomotion compared to control rats. Subchronic amphetamine treatment significantly dampened this effect in female, but not in male DAT KO rats. Additionally, amphetamine increased sociability in female, but not in male DAT KO rats. From a molecular point of view, we observed differences in the modulation of glutamatergic transmission between males and females mainly at the level of the infralimbic, but not prelimbic, prefrontal cortex, suggesting that the glutamatergic synapse may contribute to the behavioral response to amphetamine between the two sexes.\nSubchronic amphetamine treatment decreased the hyperactivity, anxiety-like, anti-social and anhedonic phenotypes of female DAT KO rats, potentially by modulating glutamate transmission in the prefrontal cortex.

        "abstract": "Lead (Pb) exposure in children and adolescents poses a significant public health risk due to its potential neurotoxic effects. While high-level Pb exposure is known to impair learning and cognition, the behavioral and molecular consequences of low-level Pb exposure during developmental periods remain poorly understood. This study examined behavioral and neurochemical changes in mice exposed to Pb acetate exposure via drinking water from 4 to 8 weeks of age, corresponding to the juvenile through early adult developmental stages in mice. Mice exposed to 30\u202fmg/L resulting in blood lead levels (BLLs) of 1.26\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.089\u202f\u00b5g/dL, while the 300\u202fmg/L group, included as a neurotoxic reference, displayed BLLs exceeding 10\u202f\u03bcg/dL. Behaviorally, exposure to 30\u202fmg/L Pb did not affect locomotor activity, however, mice exposed to 300\u202fmg/L exhibited hyperactivity and impaired nesting. Notably, impulsive and compulsive behaviors were significantly altered even at 30\u202fmg/L. Neurochemically, qPCR and Western blotting analysis revealed downregulation of DOPA decarboxylase (Ddc), an enzyme crucial for dopamine synthesis, alongside decreased dopamine levels in the striatum. Pb exposure also disrupted striatal dopaminergic signals, including tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and dopamine D2 receptors (D2R). These findings suggest that even low-level Pb exposure can lead to behavioral dysfunctions by disrupting striatal dopaminergic signaling, highlighting a previously underexplored mechanism of Pb neurotoxicity.",

        "doi": "10.1007/s43440-025-00763-0",
        "abstract": "Methylphenidate (MPH) is a central nervous system stimulant that is approved and widely used for the treatment of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and narcolepsy. It acts primarily by inhibiting the reuptake of dopamine and norepinephrine, thereby enhancing synaptic concentrations of these neurotransmitters and improving attention, impulse control, and wakefulness. Despite its well-established therapeutic efficacy, MPH is associated with a complex safety profile that necessitates careful consideration, particularly in long-term use and in populations with preexisting health conditions. Cardiovascular risks, including increased heart rate, elevated blood pressure, and, in rare cases, serious adverse events such as myocardial infarction, arrhythmias, and sudden cardiac death, have been reported. Psychiatric adverse effects, including anxiety, agitation, psychotic symptoms, and exacerbation of preexisting mood disorders, also warrant close monitoring. Additionally, MPH has the potential for misuse, abuse, and dependence, particularly due to its dopaminergic effects, which can contribute to reinforcement and addiction-related behaviors. This review synthesizes current evidence on the safety of MPH, with a focus on its impact on cardiovascular and psychiatric health, and addiction potential. Special attention is given to vulnerable populations, including children, adolescents, individuals with comorbid psychiatric or cardiovascular conditions, and those with a history of substance use disorders. Furthermore, sex and gender influence health outcomes, for MPH healthcare strategies have been addressed. Given these concerns, the necessity for rigorous patient monitoring, individualized risk assessment, and adherence to prescribing guidelines is emphasized to optimize therapeutic outcomes while minimizing risks.

        "abstract": "Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a highly heterogenous neurodevelopmental disorder with numerous genetic risk factors. Notably, a disproportionate number of risk genes encode transcription regulators including transcription factors and proteins that regulate chromatin. Here, we test the function of nine such ASD-linked transcription regulators by depleting them in primary cultured neurons. We then define the resulting gene expression disruptions using RNA sequencing and test effects on neuronal firing using multielectrode array recordings. We identify shared gene expression signatures across many ASD-risk genes that converge on the disruption of critical synaptic genes. Fitting with this, we detect robust disruptions to neuronal firing throughout neuronal maturation. Together, these findings provide evidence that the loss of multiple ASD-linked transcriptional regulators disrupts transcription of synaptic genes and has convergent effects on neuronal firing that may contribute to enhanced ASD risk.",

There is no established protocol for the neuropsychiatric evaluation of individuals with this syndrome. This study aims to define a protocol incorporating gold standard assessments.\nSix individuals with Dup15q underwent assessment of cognitive and adaptive functioning (Leiter-3, Adaptive Behavior Assessment System-Second Edition), autistic traits (Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule-2 [ADOS-2], Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised [ADI-R], Social Communication Questionnaire, Social Responsiveness Scale, Repetitive Behaviors Scale-R), co-occurring psychopathology (Kiddie Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia, Child Behavior Checklist, Swanson, Nolan, and Pelham-Forth Edition, Sleep Disturbance Scale for Children), and family functioning (Parenting Stress Index-Short Form, PedsQL). Parents were required to fill the Symptom Checklist 90 (SCL-90) and Autism-Spectrum Quotient (AQ) to gather information about their psychiatric co-occurrences and autistic traits. A molecular analysis was performed to confirm the genetic alteration.\nTwo siblings inherited the duplication through maternal transmission, whereas 4 individuals had a de novo maternal duplication. No participant exhibited preserved cognitive abilities; 4 of 5 showed below average adaptive functioning and 2 of 6 received a diagnosis of ASD. ADOS-2 revealed greater difficulties in the Social Affect domain compared with the Repetitive and Restricted Behaviors domain (p < 0.05), findings confirmed by ADI-R (p < 0.05). K-SADS indicated clinical scores in 5 individuals, with anxiety disorder in 3 participants. High levels of parental stress and a poor quality of life were reported. The mother carrier of the duplication showed clinical scores on the \"Positive Symptom Total\" of the SCL-90 and on the AQ.\nIndividuals with an in tandem 15q-11q13 duplication seems to exhibit cognitive and adaptive difficulties along with psychiatric co-occurrences and autistic traits. Parents, with or without the duplication, may experience psychopathological difficulties and impaired family functioning.",

The objective was to develop intuitive control methods that enable healthcare professionals to easily integrate the robot into clinical practice.\nTwo control modes were designed: Puppet mode, where clinicians manually operate the robot via a graphical console, and Assistant mode, where a Large Language Model translates clinicians' spoken requests into robot actions and dialogue. Twenty-three doctors evaluated both modes through video demonstrations and completed questionnaires assessing usability, usefulness, and ethical acceptability.\nBoth modes were considered effective and user-friendly. Assistant mode was perceived as more intuitive and adaptable, facilitating seamless interaction, whereas Puppet mode was judged slightly more reassuring for patients and somewhat more appropriate in terms of robot actions.\nOverall, both approaches were positively received, with Assistant mode emerging as the preferred option for integration into clinical workflows due to its perceived simplicity and flexibility. These findings highlight clinicians' positive perceptions of two novel control modes and emphasize NAO's potential to enhance patient engagement and reduce stress. Further empirical validation with children in real clinical trials is warranted to confirm these benefits and optimize robot-assisted interventions in ASD care.",

        "abstract": "Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is associated with complex neurocognitive alterations that impact social cognition, executive function, and sensory processing. Understanding these mechanisms is essential for advancing diagnosis and treatment strategies.\nWe conducted an integrative review of recent findings from structural neuroimaging, functional connectivity, molecular biology, cognitive studies, genetics, and epigenetics. Interdisciplinary approaches were summarized to examine regulatory mechanisms involved in neural development and function, as well as their impact on ASD pathophysiology.\nEvidence from brain imaging studies demonstrates notable structural changes and disrupted neural circuit connectivity, affecting both local and global communication within the brain. Neurotransmitter system dysregulation, particularly involving glutamatergic and GABAergic pathways, contributes to excitation-inhibition imbalance, a hallmark of ASD. Genetic and epigenetic research highlights familial inheritance patterns and gene-environment interactions regulating neurodevelopment. Advancements in neuroimaging biomarkers have improved early diagnosis, while customized treatment approaches targeting specific neurobiological elements are associated with better clinical outcomes.\nThis review underscores the importance of a multidimensional framework that integrates imaging, molecular biology, and genetics in understanding ASD. The findings emphasize the heterogeneity of ASD and point to the necessity of individualized treatment strategies. Future research should prioritize early biomarker identification and the development of personalized therapies responsive to neural system complexity and diverse treatment outcomes.",

Evidence from neuroimaging and clinical studies suggests that music-based interventions may engage distributed neural networks-including fronto-striatal, temporo-parietal, limbic, and brainstem circuits-through predictive timing, cross-modal synchronization, and adaptive plasticity. However, clinical translation has been hindered by methodological heterogeneity, insufficient standardization, and reduced reproducibility, together with limited integration of clinical, functional, and neurophysiological indicators, absence of unified protocols combining individualized and orchestral modules with explicit transfer mechanisms, and insufficient monitoring of fidelity and multisite feasibility. This perspective proposes the IncluSive Orchestral mUsic therapy accordiNg to the euterpe methoD (I-SOUND), a clinically adapted orchestral framework structured to integrate three complementary modules: Individual Music Therapy (IMT), an Orchestral Music Therapy module (OMT), and a Multidirectional and Iterative Transfer Process (MIT-P). Developed from the progressive refinement of the Euterpe Method and the pediatric EM Active algorithm, the model is intended to target specific neurofunctional domains and to explore generalization to everyday contexts. A two-phase evaluation-comprising an observational study followed by a randomized controlled trial-is planned to assess feasibility, fidelity, sustainability, and clinical applicability in heterogeneous NDD populations. Particular attention is given to the methodological challenge of balancing ethical inclusion with internal validity.

        "abstract": "Rates of depression among individuals with autism are notably high. Mental health services are often inaccessible, and very few interventions are adapted to their needs. Interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT) can be relevant to treating autistic individuals' depression but needs to be adapted. This article presents an adapted IPT framework for treating autistic individuals who have depressive symptoms (IPT-Au). The framework integrates a neurodiversity-informed approach with the classic IPT model along with several key adaptations. IPT-Au accounts for the tridirectional dynamics of interpersonal interactions, depressive symptoms, and autistic lived experience. This model provides a framework for implementing IPT with autistic individuals who have verbal skills suitable for brief psychotherapy.",

        "abstract": "Neurodevelopmental disorders, particularly autism spectrum disorder (ASD), are increasingly linked to prenatal exposure to environmental heavy metal mixtures. This study aimed to evaluate the neurodevelopmental risks of such mixtures by integrating human cohort data, zebrafish behavioral assays, and omics analyses, thereby advancing mechanistic and mixture-based risk assessment frameworks.\nWe applied a multi-level design: (i) a prospective population-based cohort (Shanghai Birth Cohort, n = 941) assessing prenatal exposure to lead (Pb), cadmium (Cd), mercury (Hg), and arsenic (As) measured in cord blood, with neurodevelopmental outcomes evaluated at ages 2 and 4; (ii) embryonic zebrafish models (0-5 dpf) exposed to a human-relevant mixture (Mix N) to assess locomotor and social behaviors, as well as dose-response relationships; (iii) zebrafish transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses to uncover molecular mechanisms, with emphasis on lipid and steroid metabolism; and (iv) the Similar Mixture Approach (SMACH) integrating evidence across species for risk assessment.\nMean cord blood concentrations of Pb, Cd, Hg, and As were 13.560, 0.051, 2.237, and 2.478 \u03bcg/L, respectively. Prenatal exposure to the mixture significantly impaired motor and social functions, with Pb contributing most to motor deficits and Cd to social dysfunction. Zebrafish assays confirmed dose-dependent decreases in locomotor activity and social preference. Integrated omics analyses identified substantial disruption of lipid and steroid metabolic pathways, particularly involving the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) signaling cascade. SMACH-based risk estimation suggested that over 51.7% of children in the cohort may have experienced prenatal exposure levels associated with measurable neurodevelopmental risk.\nPrenatal exposure to heavy metal mixtures may compromise early neurodevelopment via PPAR-mediated lipid metabolic dysregulation. These findings provide mechanistic evidence, highlight the vulnerability of early life to combined exposures, and support translational, mixture-informed frameworks for risk assessment and prevention.",

        "abstract": "Sleep problems are highly prevalent in children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), negatively impacting core symptoms, daytime functioning, and family well-being. While behavioral interventions are the first-line treatment, access is often limited. Digital and telehealth delivery models offer a promising approach to increase accessibility. This review systematically evaluates the effectiveness of these technology-based behavioral sleep interventions for youth with ASD.\nFollowing PRISMA guidelines, we systematically searched five databases for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and non-randomized studies (NRCTs) of digital or telehealth behavioral sleep interventions for youth (2-18 years) with ASD. The primary outcome was child sleep. Two reviewers independently screened studies, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias. We conducted random-effects meta-analyses and sensitivity analyses.\n12 studies met inclusion criteria: 6 RCTs (N\u00a0=\u00a0349) and 6 NRCTs (N\u00a0=\u00a057). Across RCTs, digital and telehealth interventions significantly improved parent-reported sleep problems compared with controls (pooled SMD\u00a0=\u00a0-0.57, 95\u00a0% CI -1.10 to -0.03; I\nEvidence from randomized trials supports that digital and telehealth-delivered behavioral sleep interventions can yield small-to-moderate improvements in caregiver-reported sleep outcomes among autistic youth-particularly in reducing time to sleep onset. Non-randomized findings are encouraging but methodologically uncertain. Future research should prioritize adequately powered RCTs using objective sleep measures, standardized intervention frameworks, and longer follow-up to strengthen causal inference and inform scalable best-practice models.",

Two researchers extracted information from publications after independent screening. According to the Evidence-Based Practice report by the National Center for Professional Development of Autism Spectrum Disorder in the United States, the interventions used in included studies were divided into three categories: evidence-based interventions, interventions with a certain evidence base, and interventions not included in the manual.\nThe review included 134 articles containing 19 different types of interventions, and the characteristics and assessment tools were summarized. Fourteen evidence-based interventions and 2 interventions with a certain evidence base were extracted. There are also 3 interventions not included in the manual but summarized due to their widespread use.\nThis scoping review summarizes the characteristics and trends of autism intervention research in China over the past decade. We summarize 14 common types of interventions, including implementation methods, measurement tools, and efficacy. More evidence-based interventions should be implemented in the future, with a greater focus on female and remote children with autism.",

        "abstract": "Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC) is a rare, multisystem genetic disorder with highly variable clinical manifestations. While international registries such as TOSCA have provided large-scale data, national-level studies remain limited. This study represents the first national cohort analysis of TSC patients in Greece, providing comprehensive insights into clinical characteristics, genotype-phenotype correlations, and previously underreported rare manifestations.\nA descriptive analysis was conducted on 115 TSC patients diagnosed based on the latest criteria. Clinical, genetic, and treatment-related data were analysed, with a particular focus on neurological, renal, cardiac, dermatological, and pulmonary manifestations, as well as rare or atypical disease presentations.\nThe median age at diagnosis was 1.2 years (range: 0-43 years). Epilepsy was the most frequent initial symptom (70.4\u00a0%), with drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE) affecting 39.5\u00a0% of cases. Intellectual disability, autism spectrum disorder, and behavioral issues correlated significantly with early seizure onset and TSC2 variants. Common manifestations include cortical tubers (93.9\u00a0%), subependymal nodules (92.2\u00a0%), angiomyolipomas (48.7\u00a0%), and cardiac rhabdomyoma (33\u00a0%). Notably, we report several rare manifestations, including high-grade glioma in a pediatric patient, diffuse lipomatosis, pancreatic neuroendocrine tumours, rectal polyps, and erythema nodosum presented in a patient on everolimus therapy, further highlighting the systemic complexity and malignancy risks in TSC.\nOur study provides novel epidemiological and clinical data on TSC in Greece, reinforcing genotype-phenotype correlations and expanding the spectrum of rare manifestations. These findings emphasise the need for lifelong surveillance, multidisciplinary management, and early detection strategies to mitigate long-term complications. This study also contributes to the broader understanding of TSC by documenting atypical presentations that may inform future clinical guidelines and patient care strategies.",

The present study reviews evidence of one such potential marker - nonverbal synchrony. Nonverbal synchrony reflects the correlation between individuals' movements during an interaction and can be measured objectively using motion energy analysis. In our review, we found studies on nonverbal synchrony among individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), schizophrenia, major depressive disorder (MDD), social anxiety disorder (SAD), and borderline personality disorder (BPD). As nonverbal synchrony was associated with diverse variables among individuals with diverse disorders, we systematically reviewed the findings for each disorder separately to describe the state of the evidence in the field. We found that nonverbal synchrony was lower among individuals with psychopathology. We also found unique patterns associated with specific disorders: low nonverbal synchrony and normal levels of movement were associated with ASD, low nonverbal synchrony and low levels of movement were associated with schizophrenia, patterns of over- and under-synchrony depending on context were associated with SAD. Implication for diagnosis and treatment of psychiatric disorders are discussed.",

In vivo positron emission tomography (PET) with radioligands [11\u00a0C]raclopride (D2R) and [11\u00a0C]carfentanil (MOR) was carried out in 16 adult males with high functioning ASD and 24 age and sex matched controls. A whole brain voxel-wise analysis was tested with Student\u00b4s t-test and regional group differences in D2R and MOR receptor availabilities as total and separate were tested with linear mixed models also examining the associations between regional receptor availabilities with correlations.\nThere were no group differences in whole-brain voxel-wise analysis of D2R, but ROI analysis revealed a lower overall mean availability in striatum of the ASD compared to controls. Post hoc regional analysis revealed reduced D2R availability in nucleus accumbens and globus pallidus of the ASD group. The whole-brain voxel-wise analysis of MOR revealed cuneal/precuneal up-regulation in the ASD group, but there was no overall group difference in the ROI analysis for MOR. MOR down-regulation was observed in the hippocampi of the ASD group in a post hoc analysis. Regional correlations between D2R and MOR availabilities were weaker in the ASD group versus control group in the amygdala and nucleus accumbens.\nThese alterations may translate to disrupted modulation of social motivation and reward in ASD.",

        "abstract": "The potential benefits of music in prenatal and early childhood education are widely acknowledged, yet the neurobiological mechanisms underlying its effects on social behavior, particularly during early development, remain underexplored. This study investigated the impact of musical intervention on social behavior and neurodevelopment in mice, focusing on mechanisms at various developmental stages. Pregnant mice were exposed to music starting at embryonic day 13 (E13) and continuing until postnatal weeks 1, 3, or 5. Behavioral tests, including three-chamber social task and social interaction assays, revealed that musical exposure significantly enhanced social interaction in adult mice. mRNA sequencing revealed notable changes in the expression of genes associated with social behavior in both the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and the amygdala. Additionally, Golgi staining demonstrated increased dendritic complexity, spine density, and dendritic length in these regions following music exposure. Elevated MAP2 expression was observed in the mPFC and amygdala, whereas GFAP expression was reduced in the amygdala. These findings provide valuable insights into the neurobiological mechanisms by which music affects early development and underscore its potential as a noninvasive tool to promote social and emotional well-being. This research has implications for therapeutic interventions in individuals with neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism spectrum disorder (ASD).",

        "abstract": "Mitochondrial dysfunction is increasingly implicated in autism spectrum disorder (ASD), yet its causal genetic basis remains unclear. Mitochondria are maternally inherited organelles essential for neurodevelopment and cellular energy homeostasis, while most mitochondrial proteins are nuclear-encoded and follow Mendelian inheritance. Clarifying how genetically regulated mitochondrial gene activity relates to ASD risk may provide new mechanistic insight.\nWe applied a multi-omics Mendelian randomization (MR) framework integrating methylation (mQTL), expression (eQTL; blood and 12 GTEx brain regions), and protein (pQTL) datasets. We used summary-data-based MR (SMR) with HEIDI to exclude LD-driven signals and Bayesian colocalization (PPH4\u202f>\u202f0.70) to require a shared causal variant. Where independent cis instruments were available, two-sample MR estimated effects and assessed robustness. ASD outcomes came from IEU-802, IEU-806, and FinnGen GWAS.\nConvergent evidence highlighted three mitochondria-related genes. CRAT and PRDX6 showed cross-layer support in specific datasets (mQTL/eQTL/pQTL) with overall protective associations. TMEM177 was supported across mQTL and eQTL and exhibited tissue-specific divergence-risk-increasing associations in cerebellar/cortical regions but protective associations in peripheral blood. TMEM177's biology is consistent with a role in complex IV (COX2) assembly, CRAT regulates acetyl-CoA buffering and metabolic flexibility, and PRDX6 contributes to redox homeostasis and membrane repair. Locus-specific CpG variation was directionally aligned with gene expression and ASD risk.\nOur findings support a structure-metabolism-redox axis-TMEM177, CRAT, and PRDX6-linking mitochondrial regulation to ASD susceptibility.",

        "abstract": "Limosilactobacillus reuteri has attracted attention for its potential to modulate the gut-brain axis. This study investigates whether L. reuteri administration mitigates autism-related abnormalities in a maternal separation rat model of autism. Male Wistar rats were divided into maternal-separated L. reuteri-treated (MS+LR), maternal-separated placebo-treated (MS), and non-separated control groups. Behavioral assessments evaluated autism-related behaviors, including social interaction, repetitive behavior, anxiety, and hyperactivity. Immunohistochemical analysis of the hypothalamus assessed oxytocin expression, while 3D stereological analysis of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) examined brain structure in the infralimbic (IL) and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). Absolute quantification of fecal L. reuteri was performed using quantitative real-time PCR. The MS+LR group showed significantly higher L. reuteri colonization, improved social behaviors, and reduced repetitive behaviors. Immunohistochemical findings revealed normalized oxytocin expression in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the MS+LR group, suggesting a neurobiological mechanism. The IL volume and neuron number in the MS group were significantly increased compared to the control and MS+LR groups, while the ACC volume and neuron number were significantly decreased. These findings suggest that L. reuteri ameliorates autism-like symptoms induced by maternal separation by modulating brain structure through oxytocin-dependent pathways.",

        "abstract": "The efficacy of acupuncture as a nonpharmacological therapy for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) has been increasingly studied. To evaluate the current research methodologies and outcome measures in randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of acupuncture for ASD, we systematically searched eight major databases for relevant Chinese and English language literature published between 1 January 2015 and 31 December 2024. A total of 31 relevant studies were included in the literature review. Studies on acupuncture interventions for ASD were categorised into two- or three-arm designs, primarily employing indirect controls. Interventions predominantly utilised head acupoints for 12 weeks, and the acupuncture techniques were mainly tonifying and reducing techniques with moderate stimulation. Outcome indicators (n = 37) were categorised into six domains, selected a total of 111 times: symptoms and signs (59.46 %), physical and chemical test indicators (20.72 %), quality of life (8.11 %), safety events (7.21 %), functional status (2.70 %), and Chinese medical symptoms/syndrome (2.70 %). The Childhood Autism Rating Scale had the highest reporting rate among the indicators (23.24 %). Measurements were predominantly performed before treatment, post-treatment, and at the 12-week follow-up visit. Current evidence from RCTs on acupuncture for ASD is limited, restricting the clinical implementation of acupuncture protocols. Future high-quality studies should focus on standardising clinical trial designs, minimising bias, establishing consensus-driven outcome measurement selection, and developing a core outcome set for acupuncture in patients with ASD. These steps are essential for enhancing the methodological rigor and clinical relevance of acupuncture research in ASD.",

Autistic people and those with high autistic traits who were not diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) used social functions less frequently than those without autism. Thus, this study seeks to answer the question of whether autistic people and those with high levels of autistic traits who were not diagnosed with ASD and who use the social function of autobiographical memory less frequently do so because they have diminished open-air memory. To achieve this, university students who were not diagnosed with ASD were divided into high and low groups based on the number of autistic traits; open-air and laboratory encoding were conducted. Furthermore, we examined the correlation between memory performance and the social functions of autobiographical memory. The results showed that the performance of open-air encoding was better than that of laboratory encoding, regardless of the group. There was no significant correlation between performance in open-air encoding and the social function of the autobiographical memory. These findings emphasise the importance of actual experience in memory formation, even in an increasingly digitalised world.",

        "abstract": "The present study examined caregivers' utilization of and experience with genetic counseling services for their children diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD).\nWe surveyed 1063 caregivers from the Simons Foundation Powering Autism Research for Knowledge (SPARK). A logistic regression analysis was conducted in SPSS 29.0 to examine the factors associated with caregivers' utilization of genetic counseling for ASD. Caregivers' self-reported experience with the counseling services they received were analyzed using NVivo 14.0.\nOnly 7.4% of the caregivers reported having received the genetic counseling services from genetic counselors, and most of the caregivers had limited awareness of genetic counseling services and knowledge of genetic testing. Caregivers' utilization of genetic counseling services was associated with several factors, including whether they had pursued genetic testing, the caregivers' awareness of genetic counseling services, their knowledge of genetic testing, and the presence of co-occurring intellectual disabilities.\nThese findings underscore the critical role of improving awareness and access to genetic counseling services for families of children with ASD. Additionally, there is a critical need to support caregivers with clear, accessible information about genetic services for ASD. Healthcare providers - particularly pediatricians, developmental specialists, and genetic professionals are encouraged to take a more proactive role in initiating conversations with families about genetic counseling and testing, helping families make informed decisions. Enhancing communication and support around genetic services can better prepare caregivers to navigate the complexities of genetic testing.",

Previous research has shown a significant relationship between SPD and a wide range of disorders, from the autism spectrum to affective and anxiety disorders and schizophrenia. Assessing SPD according to Winnie Dunn's Four Quadrant Model, identifies 4 types of sensory processing: Low Registration, Sensation Seeking, Sensory Sensitivity, and Sensation Avoiding. The model allows analysis of the functioning of people with psychiatric disorders, highlighting the importance of diagnosis and sensory therapy as an important component of support in psychiatric treatment. Understanding these relationships is essential for developing more effective therapeutic strategies that take into account the specificity of sensory processing in people with psychiatric disorders. The article highlights the potential benefits of using sensory therapy as an adjunct to traditional treatments and also underscores the need for further research to better understand the complexity of the relationship between SPD and psychiatric disorders, which could help improve patients' quality of life.",

The population sample included 822 children (94% with ASD, along with paired neurotypical children) from 8 countries, and most studies applied standardized scales to define and/or confirm the diagnoses. The main benefits of playfulness in the stimulation of these children were: improvement of social and socio-emotional aspects, social engagement, development of symbolic and narrative play skills, engagement in pretend play, as well as improvement of motor skills and executive functions, which reflect in autonomy for daily activities. The importance of playful interventions in promoting the cognitive, social, and emotional development of children with ASD is highlighted.",

This study investigated the association between ASD after lumbar interbody fusion and lumbosacral transitional vertebrae (LSTV).\nWe retrospectively reviewed the perioperative data for 132 patients undergoing first-time L4-5 spinal interbody fusion without decompression outside the index level for degenerative spinal disease between April 2005 and December 2022. ASD was defined as a degenerative disease at adjacent levels requiring reoperation; LSTV was classified using the Castellvi classification (types II, III, and IV).\nA total of 33 patients (26\u202f%) had an LSTV (type IIa: n\u202f=\u202f24, type IIb: n\u202f=\u202f9). Postoperatively, 18 (13.6\u202f%) patients developed ASD, of which six had LSTV (4 of type IIa, 2 of type IIb). Among the 114 non-ASD patients, 27 had an LSTV (20 of type IIa, 7 of type IIb). The difference regarding ASD occurrence between patients with and without LSTV was statistically insignificant (p\u202f=\u202f0.27); however, the duration to reoperation for ASD was significantly shorter for Castellvi type IIb patients (mean = 21.5 months) than non-LSTV patients (mean = 90.9 months) (p\u202f=\u202f0.036).

        "abstract": "Accurately outlining (\"segmenting\") pelvic organs from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans is crucial for studying pelvic organ prolapse. The labor-intensive process of segmentation that identifies which pixels correspond to a particular organ in MRI datasets imposes a significant bottleneck on training AI to do automated segmentation techniques, underscoring a need for methods that can operate effectively with minimal pre-labeled data.\nThe aim of this study is to introduce a novel semi-supervised learning process that uses limited data annotation in pelvic MRI to improve automated segmentation. By effectively using both labeled and unlabeled MRI data, our approach seeks to improve the accuracy and efficiency of pelvic organ segmentation, thereby reducing the reliance on extensive labeled datasets for AI model training.\nThe study used a semi-supervised deep learning framework for uterus and bladder segmentation, in which a model is trained using both a small number of expert-outlined structures and a large number of unlabeled scans, leveraging the information from the labeled data to guide the model and improve its predictions on the unlabeled data. It involved 4,103 MR images from 48 female subjects. This approach included self-supervised learning of image restoration tasks for feature extraction and pseudo-label generation, followed by combined supervised learning on labeled images and unsupervised training on unlabeled images. The method's performance was evaluated quantitatively using the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC), Average Surface Distance (ASD), and 95% Hausdorff Distance (HD95). For statistical analysis, two-tailed paired t-tests were conducted for comparison.\nThis framework demonstrated the capacity to achieve segmentation accuracy comparable to traditional methods while requiring only about 60% of the typically necessary labeled data. Specifically, the semi-supervised approach achieved DSCs of 0.84\u00b10.04, ASDs of 13.98\u00b10.93, HD95s of 2.15\u00b10.40 for the uterus, and 0.92\u00b10.05, 2.51\u00b10.83, 2.88\u00b10.17 for the bladder respectively (P-value<0.001 for all), outperforming both the baseline supervised learning and transfer learning models. Additionally, 3D reconstructions using the semi-supervised method exhibited superior details in the visualized organs.\nThis study's semi-supervised learning framework wherein the full use of unlabeled data markedly reduces the necessity for extensive manual annotations, achieving high segmentation accuracy with substantially fewer labeled images that can enhance clinical evaluation and advance medical image analysis by reducing the dependency on large-scale labeled pelvic MRI datasets for training.",

Eligible participants lived with and provided daily care for the child. Data was collected through structured interviews covering three domains: (A) demographic and socioeconomic characteristics, (B) observed visual problems in children, and (C) knowledge of visual impairment and its impact.\nA total of 123 parents and caregivers participated, 65% of whom were recruited from three major centers: the National Center for Autism, Al Safa Institute, and Baghdad Governmental Center for Autism. Biological parents comprised 97.6% of the sample; 2.4% were kinship caregivers. Parents/caregivers reported that 49.6% of children had been diagnosed with visual impairments, while 20 out of 62 (16.3%) of undiagnosed children exhibited behavioral signs of vision issues, including close screen proximity. Refractive errors (43.9%) and ocular misalignments (26.8%) were most common, with myopia (33.3%) being the leading diagnosis. Awareness scores indicated that 35 (28.5%) had poor awareness, 65(52.8%) moderate, and 23 (18.7%) good. Caregivers had significantly higher awareness than biological parents (P\u2009=\u20090.006), while employed respondents showed lower awareness levels (P\u2009=\u20090.015).\nChildren with ASD are prone to undiagnosed visual impairments; however, a considerable proportion of parents were completely unaware of this issue. Enhancing parental awareness and integrating interdisciplinary vision screening into publicly funded ASD services are vital for early detection, prevention, and long-term management.",

        "abstract": "To evaluate longitudinal trends in postoperative pain following long-segment thoracolumbar fusion for adult spinal deformity (ASD) and assess the influence of patient-specific factors on pain outcomes.\u00a0Adult patients who underwent long-segment thoracolumbar fusion (\u2265\u20094 segments) for ASD between 2016 and 2021 were included. Visual Analog Scale (VAS) scores were collected preoperatively and at postoperative 6-month increments, up to 36 months. Linear mixed models (LMM) evaluated longitudinal trends and the impact of age, gender, BMI, and levels fused on pain outcomes.\u00a0Final analysis included 138 patients. Preoperatively, median VAS was 8.0 for back and 6.5 for leg. At six months, back pain improved by -3.6 (p\u2009<\u20090.001), and leg pain by -2.9 (p\u2009<\u20090.001). Improvements persisted through 36 months, with back pain reduced by -4.0 and leg pain by -3.8 (p\u2009<\u20090.001 for both). Leg pain improved between six and 12 months (mean difference: -2.2, p\u2009<\u20090.001), however, no other inter-time point analyses were significant for any VAS category. Higher BMI was associated with worse back and leg pain (p\u2009=\u20090.017 and p\u2009<\u20090.001), while older age correlated with significantly lower pain scores.\u00a0Long-segment thoracolumbar fusion provides significant, sustained pain relief, with the most improvement within six to 12 months and plateauing thereafter. These findings emphasize the need for realistic expectations regarding the extent and timeline of pain relief for patients. The role of BMI and age in pain trends highlights the importance of personalized counseling.",

        "abstract": "Osteoporosis is considered one of the important factors influencing the biomechanics of the lumbar spine. Oblique lumbar interbody fusion (OLIF) is an emerging lumbar interbody fusion technique. Adjacent segment degeneration (ASD) is a common complication after lumbar interbody fusion surgery. This study primarily discusses the impact of OLIF on ASD in patients with osteoporosis.\nAn intact three-dimensional finite element model of the lumbar spine from L1 to S1 was established. An osteoporosis model was established based on the intact model. The OLIF with osteoporosis model was established based on the osteoporosis model, with L4-L5 as the surgical segment. The range of motion (ROM), intervertebral disc pressure, intervertebral disc Tresca stress, and endplate stress of the cranial adjacent segment (L3-L4) were compared between the OLIF with osteoporosis model and osteoporosis model.\nThe ROM, intervertebral disc pressure, intervertebral disc Tresca stress, and endplate stress at the L3-L4 level in the osteoporosis model were all higher than in the intact model. These biomechanical parameters at the cranial adjacent segment (L3-L4) in the OLIF with osteoporosis model were significantly higher than in the osteoporosis model. Compared to the osteoporosis model, the OLIF with osteoporosis model showed the greatest increase in biomechanical parameters at the cranial adjacent segment during flexion and lateral bending.\nOLIF carries the risk of accelerating adjacent segment degeneration at the cranial level after surgery in patients with osteoporosis.",

        "abstract": "This study examined the morphological and morpho-syntactic abilities of Hebrew-speaking adolescents with and without ASD. The participants consisted of 59 adolescents, divided into two groups: 29 with ASD (5 girls, 24 boys, ages 14-18) and 30 typically developing (TD) peers (9 girls, 21 boys, ages 14-18). Assessments included measures of non-verbal intelligence, vocabulary, and the production of morphological and morpho-syntactic structures. Group comparisons and correlations between background variables and performance on morphological and morpho-syntactic tasks were conducted. Additionally, individual analyses were performed to identify language profiles within the ASD group. The results revealed significant differences favoring TD adolescents in tasks related to past tense verb inflection, as well as mixed-tense verb inflection. Both groups found tasks involving regular components to be easier. In both groups, vocabulary was correlated with performance on various morphological and morpho-syntactic tasks. Alongside some similarities in the hierarchy of task difficulty across the two groups, notable differences in this hierarchy were also observed. Two distinct language profiles were identified among the adolescents with ASD. The study underscores the importance of tailored language assessments and targeted interventions and recommends longitudinal studies to determine whether these challenges are the result of developmental delays or persistent deficits.",

        "abstract": "Promoting thermogenesis in adipose tissue to enhance energy expenditure is widely regarded as a promising strategy for obesity treatment. However, the development of effective thermogenic drugs remains challenging. Our screenings identified the natural compound Akebia Saponin D (ASD) as a potent brown fat thermogenesis activator in mice, showing effects through mitochondrial brown fat uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1)-dependent pathways. ASD was found to significantly mitigate high-fat diet-induced obesity and enhance the mitochondrial quality of brown adipocytes to promote thermogenesis. Utilizing human protein microarrays, cellular thermal shift assay, and drug affinity responsive target stability, along with microscale thermophoresis and molecular docking analysis, we identified ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase 4 (USP4) as a direct target of ASD. ASD interacts with USP4 and promotes the deubiquitination of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma, thus inhibiting its proteasomal degradation and enhancing the transcriptional activation of UCP1 in brown adipocytes. Additionally, USP4 knockdown was shown to attenuate brown fat thermogenesis induced by ASD. In summary, our findings demonstrate that ASD promotes brown fat thermogenesis by targeting USP4, highlighting its potential as a promising natural small molecule for obesity treatment.",

The European Reference Network ERN-ITHACA (Intellectual disability, TeleHealth, Autism and Congenital Anomalies) on Rare Congenital Malformations and Rare Intellectual Disability aims to improve this transition through the development of a guideline.\nPopulation-specific recommendations for the optimal transition to adult healthcare were developed by an interdisciplinary consortium, representing clinical, scientific and lived experience experts from nine European countries. Recommendations of the 2016 National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guideline 'Transition From Children's to Adults' Services for Young People Using Health or Social Care Services' (NG43) were adapted, based on a literature review, expert opinion and lived experiences gathered through a survey, focus groups and discussions with self-advocates. A consensus meeting was held in Gda\u0144sk, Poland, in October 2024.\nNICE guideline recommendations were adopted or adapted to the target population where necessary. New recommendations were formulated regarding the involvement of and assistance for young people and their families/caregivers, the coordination of interdisciplinary care, the role of centres of expertise, recommended interventions and psychosocial support.\nPlanned, coordinated, specialised, individualised and interdisciplinary healthcare is required to support young people with (genetic) intellectual disabilities. Active collaboration between healthcare providers, researchers and individuals with lived experience is essential both to improve current healthcare and to build a stronger evidence base for successful transition interventions going forward.",

Across a range of adulthood markers, including romantic relationships, independent living, full-time employment, and financial self-sufficiency, autistic young adults were less likely to achieve traditional adult milestones.\nThe transition to adulthood remains a period of heightened vulnerability for autistic youth.

        "abstract": "Whilst research in multilingualism and autism is increasing, there is still a gap when it comes to understanding how multilingual autistic individuals use their multiple languages. The aim of this research was to survey these linguistic behaviours from a self-report perspective and compare them to non-autistic multilingual individuals.\nWe collected data from 364 participants of which 177 (autistic\u2009=\u200998; mean age\u2009=\u200944.5, non-autistic\u2009=\u200979; mean age\u2009=\u200942.2) were included in the final analysis. Multilingual usage and switching behaviour were measured through an online questionnaire made available on Qualtrics, developed for the purpose of this research.\nThe questionnaire revealed that autistic participants rated themselves as more multilingual, based on number of languages known, and used their respective languages more than non-autistic participants, although they reported switching between their languages as more effortful than non-autistic participants. A large portion of autistic individuals also reported using a non-native language daily and a similar number of autistic and non-autistic participants reported having lived in a country where their first or second language was spoken. Overall, autistic participants reported comparable or more multilingual language usage than non-autistic participants.\nThe results of this research demonstrate that speaking autistic adults are, as one might intuitively expect, living active multilingual lives comparable to their typical peers. Future research should further investigate the rapport autistic multilingual individuals have with their linguistic communities via their language usage and the cognitive flexibility that may be associated with living multilingual and cross-national lives.",

        "abstract": "This paper re-examines phenomenological accounts of autism in light of the double empathy theory. I fully endorse the compelling critique by contemporary phenomenologists such as Gallagher, Fuchs, and Zahavi of the Theory of Mind framework, as they ground autistic social difficulties in impairments of primary and secondary intersubjectivity. However, their analyses tend to underemphasize or overlook the reciprocal structure of empathy, an aspect that is crucial for a comprehensive understanding of autistic-allistic social interactions. This omission has been rightly criticized by proponents of the double empathy theory, such as Rizzo and Ekdahl, who emphasize that social breakdowns between autistic and allistic individuals are bidirectional. Drawing on Husserl's classical phenomenology of empathy, I argue that a deeper phenomenological understanding reveals empathy to be inherently reciprocal and co-constituted. Thus, Husserlian phenomenology not only aligns with the core insights of the double empathy theory but also offers a conceptual foundation for rethinking autistic experience beyond unidirectional deficit models.",

Dissecting the interplay between inherited variants and high-impact de novo variants is critical for understanding its etiology. We conducted a family-based study involving 42 families with ASD (139 individuals). Using a targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) panel of 236 genes, we identified and characterized rare inherited and de novo variants in affected probands, parents, and unaffected siblings. Our analysis revealed a complex genetic landscape marked by diverse inheritance patterns. De novo variants were predominantly observed in individuals with atypical autism, while biparental (homozygous) inheritance was more common in Asperger syndrome. Maternally inherited variants showed significant enrichment in intronic regions, pointing to a potential regulatory role. We also detected variants in several high-confidence ASD risk genes, including ",

        "abstract": "Perioperative management of patients with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) often requires premedication and physical restraint. This study examined the characteristics of patients with ASD who required special interventions for general anesthesia, particularly physical restraint during induction.\nThis retrospective study included patients diagnosed with ASD (autism, pervasive developmental disorder, Rett syndrome, Asperger's syndrome, or childhood disintegrative disorder) based on established criteria. All patients underwent general anesthesia at a hospital for patients with disabilities between April 2019 and March 2022. Data collected included clinical and demographic characteristics, perioperative management (premedication and anesthetic methods), surgical indications, physical restraint use, and induction time. A comparative analysis was conducted to identify differences in patient characteristics and induction times between physical restraint and no-restraint groups. Induction times were compared using Kaplan-Meier survival curves and log-rank tests.\nA total of 136 procedures were performed on 102 patients. Median age was 23.3\u00a0years (interquartile range: 12.8-35.2), 79% of participants were male, and approximately 40% exhibited self-injurious or aggressive behaviors. Dental procedures were the most common indication for anesthesia. Midazolam and pentobarbital were the most frequently administered premedications. Patients requiring physical restraint were generally larger and more likely to exhibit self-injurious or aggressive behaviors than those who did not. However, induction times were not prolonged in the physical restraint group compared with the no-restraint group.\nThe characteristics identified in this study, such as large body size, self-injurious behavior, and aggressive behavior, may inform future research aimed at refining physical restraint use for patients with ASD.",

        "doi": "10.25122/jml-2025-0118",
        "abstract": "Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) in adult women without intellectual or language impairments is frequently under-recognized, due to subtler manifestations, greater use of compensatory social strategies, and reliance on diagnostic frameworks developed from male presentations. Diagnostic overshadowing, where autistic traits are misattributed to other psychiatric conditions, further delays accurate identification. This narrative review aims to critically evaluate recent evidence on the diagnostic challenges of ASD in adult women without intellectual or language impairments, assess the performance of widely used screening tools, and present recommendations for improving gender-sensitive diagnostic practices. A structured literature search was applied (PubMed, PsycINFO, Scopus; January 2010-July 2025; English language) targeting studies on females aged \u226518 years without intellectual or language impairment. Diagnostic accuracy, screening tools, camouflaging, misdiagnosis, and psychosocial outcomes were examined. Original research, meta-analyses, and systematic reviews were included, and a narrative synthesis approach was chosen due to study heterogeneity. Female-typical presentations often include subtle social-communication differences, context-specific restricted interests, and higher camouflage levels than males, which decrease the sensitivity of standard screening tools. Women are more likely to receive prior psychiatric diagnoses before ASD is recognized, contributing to mental health burdens and poorer functional outcomes. Current adult ASD screening tools have limited capacity to detect female phenotypes. Integrating camouflaging assessment, nuanced developmental histories, and updated, gender-inclusive screening instruments is essential to improving diagnostic equity.",

        "abstract": "In large public multi-site fMRI datasets, the sample characteristics, data acquisition methods, and MRI scanner models vary across sites and datasets. This non-neural variability obscures neural differences between groups and leads to poor machine learning based diagnostic classification of neurodevelopmental conditions. This could be potentially addressed by domain adaptation, which aims to improve classification performance in a given target domain by utilizing the knowledge learned from a different source domain by making data distributions of the two domains as similar as possible. In order to demonstrate the utility of domain adaptation for multi-site fMRI data, this research developed a variational autoencoder-maximum mean discrepancy (VAE-MMD) deep learning model for three-way diagnostic classification: (i) Autism, (ii) Asperger's syndrome, and (iii) typically developing controls. This study chooses ABIDE-II (Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange) dataset as the target domain and ABIDE-I as the source domain. The results show that domain adaptation from ABIDE-I to ABIDE-II provides superior test accuracy of ABIDE-II compared to just using ABIDE-II for classification. Further, augmenting the source domain with additional healthy control subjects from Healthy Brain Network (HBN) and Amsterdam Open MRI Collection (AOMIC) datasets enables transfer learning and improves ABIDE-II classification performance. Finally, a comparison with statistical data harmonization techniques, such as ComBat, reveals that domain adaptation using VAE-MMD achieves comparable performance, and incorporating transfer learning (TL) with additional healthy control data substantially improves classification accuracy beyond that achieved by statistical methods (such as ComBat) alone. The dataset and the model used in this study are publicly available. The neuroimaging community can explore the possibility of further improving the model by utilizing the ever-increasing amount of healthy control fMRI data in the public domain.",

        "abstract": "World Health Organisation (WHO) in 2024 identified that approximately one in 100 children globally has autism spectrum disorder (ASD). ASD is a collection of neurodevelopmental disorders that impact a person's ability to socially interact and communicate, which can typically be noticed in early childhood. While 'autism' as a term was initially used for schizophrenic patients, later psychiatrists Dr. Kanner and paediatrician Dr. Asperger introduced it as a syndrome in children with behavioural differences in social interaction and communication with restrictive and repetitive interests. In today's time, the umbrella term 'ASDs' is used to describe a clinically heterogeneous group of neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs).\nTo examine the role of traditional approaches and the potential effectiveness of artificial intelligence (AI) methods in dealing with ASDs for improving the accuracy in its diagnosis and treatment.\nThe study adopts a narrative review approach to understand the application of AI in ASD. For this purpose, around a hundred research articles were selected from the years 2010-2024. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were identified. The review is organised and grounded on the medical treatment, occupational remedy, vocational remedy, psychology, family remedy and recuperation engineering.\nThe results show the undisputed role of AI and its ability to identify early indicators of autism, in accordance with the UN Sustainable Development Goal 3 (Good Health and Well-being) and Goal 16 (Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions). Further, healthcare sectors which are using a variety of AI analyses on data sources, genetics, neuroimaging, behavioural patterns and electronic medical records are able to early detect for individualised evaluation of ASD. The significance of timely interventions with the help of machine learning (ML) algorithms demonstrates high accuracy in differentiating ASD from neurotypical development and other developmental disorders.AI-driven therapeutic interventions expand social interactions and communication skills in people with ASD in the form of virtual reality-based training, augmentative communication systems and robot-assisted therapies. Thus, the future of AI in ASD holds promise for improving diagnostic accuracy, implementing telehealth platforms and customising treatment plans, despite obstacles such as data privacy and interpretability.",

The authors aimed to confirm the diagnostic accuracy of the scale in a wider population.\n279 children from 2.5 to 12 yo were recruited, most of them under evaluation for possible ASD in the APAE of Passo Fundo/RS, as well as children with other diagnoses and normal children. Their parents/relatives answered the 48 binary questions (yes/no) of the Mini-TEA scale, divided into 15 items, which resulted in a score from 0 to 15. After that, the children were evaluated regarding the diagnostic criteria of ASD by experienced raters (gold standard) who had previously submitted to a concordance test and remained unaware of the children's scores. Sensitivity and specificity Figs. were obtained. Factor analysis and Item Response Theory approaches were used for validity evidence.\n115 children were diagnosed with ASD. Scores \u22659 had 98.3 % of sensitivity and 62.2 % of specificity for the diagnosis. Two cases with the typical presentation of Asperger's syndrome scored lower than 9. The mean time for screening was about 8.5 min. The validation model presented excellent coefficients of factorability. The analysis showed that the total variance of the scores of the scale through the 15 items was explained only by the set of ASD symptoms (unidimensionality).\nThe Mini-TEA scale is a very sensitive tool to screen for ASD and has high internal consistency for assessing typical autistic symptoms.",

        "abstract": "Siblings of children with chronic disorders are at risk of developing mental health problems. Studies are inconclusive about whether sibling mental health is best predicted by the specific diagnoses of the child with disorder or by transdiagnostic factors. The aims of the present study were (1) to examine if specific diagnoses predicted sibling mental health, and (2) to examine if disorder severity in the child with the chronic disorder predicted sibling mental health. Baseline data from a randomized controlled trial were used. Siblings (aged 8 - 16\u00a0years) of children with chronic disorders and their parents were recruited from eight municipality and hospital clinics (N\u2009=\u2009288). The children with chronic disorders were placed in ICD-10 diagnostic categories based on combined parent report and clinical records. Regression analyses with the most frequent primary diagnoses (ADHD, Asperger syndrome, autism, down syndrome, rare disorders) and a measure of disorder severity as predictors of sibling mental health were run. Father-reported disorder severity predicted sibling-reported internalizing problems and father-reported internalizing and externalizing problems in siblings. Mother-reported disorder severity predicted mother-reported sibling internalizing problems. No single primary diagnosis predicted sibling internalizing or externalizing problems. Disorder severity does to an extent predict sibling mental health, whereas single diagnostic categories do not. Disorder severity may be used to identify siblings at risk and/or in need of interventions. Fathers should be included in assessment and health care for siblings as their reports seem to predict sibling mental health better than the mothers.",

        "abstract": "A 29-year-old Spanish Caucasian man, without relevant family history, was attended in our unit due to an undiagnosed skeletal dysplasia associated with low bone mass and several fragility fractures throughout his childhood and adolescence. DXA exams throughout his life showed very low BMD values; currently, his spinal and femoral neck T-scores were\u2009-\u20094.3 and\u2009-\u20093.5, respectively. Blood and urinary tests were normal. Other relevant features included right hand and foot syndactyly, aplasia cutis, right hemibody hypoplasia, vertebral malformations, abnormal-looking humerii, and Asperger's syndrome among others. Whole exome sequencing retrieved a highly probable pathogenic variant in the PORCN gene p.(Arg296Pro) in mosaicism. PORCN mutations cause focal dermal hypoplasia (FDH), an X-linked ultra-rare ecto-mesodermal disorder characterized by several of the findings the patient presented. However, low BMD has not been classically associated with the disease. Noteworthy, PORCN is key for canonical Wnt signaling. Literature scrutiny has yielded other cases of FDH with skeletal fragility during childhood. In addition, preclinical studies with PORCN inhibitors, currently under development as an antitumoral therapy, have shown rapid detrimental effects on bone mass. Collectively, these findings indicate that FDH is probably an underrecognized monogenic cause of low bone mass due to defective Wnt signaling.",

        "doi": "10.3390/pediatric17010006",
        "abstract": "Level 1 autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental condition characterised by challenges in social and communication skills. Despite these difficulties, individuals with level 1 ASD often exhibit average intelligence and typical language development. Improving socialisation skills in this population requires tailored approaches that address their specific needs and include targeted strategies. This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of a structured social skills training programme for adolescents and young adults with level 1 ASD.\nParticipants diagnosed with level 1 ASD, regardless of gender, were consecutively recruited from an outpatient clinic. The intervention involved activities from the Social Skills, Autonomy, and Awareness Module, specifically designed for adolescents and young adults. Sessions were conducted fortnightly, lasting 1.5 to 3 h each, over 17 months. Adaptive behaviour was assessed using the Vineland Adaptive Behaviour Scales (VABS) at baseline and after completing the programme. Data were analysed with SPSS version 22.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Statistical methods included automatic clustering to identify optimal clusters and Pearson's Chi-square and Fisher's exact tests to evaluate variable distributions among the clusters.\nA total of 31 participants (77.4% female) with a mean age of 20.1 years (SD = 7.0) were included in the study. Two distinct clusters emerged. Cluster 1 (n = 8) had significantly higher mean ages and baseline Vineland II socialisation scores than Cluster 2 (n = 23). Both clusters demonstrated significant improvements in social skills following the intervention.\nThis study highlights distinct profiles within individuals with level 1 ASD, showing a clear link between age and social skill development. The intervention improved social skills for most participants, regardless of the age at which treatment began. For some individuals, alternative or augmented treatment strategies may be necessary to achieve optimal results.",

Significant and consistent associations have been identified between autism characteristics-restricted repetitive behaviors and sensory features-and high levels of stress and anxiety. For a better understanding of the issue, it is necessary to consider the cognitive aspects that can help explain variations in stress and anxiety levels among adults with autism. We therefore aimed to model the contributions of worry and intolerance of uncertainty on the relationship between autism characteristics (sensory sensitivities and repetitive behaviors) and psychological distress (stress and anxiety).\nThe sample comprised 144 autistic individuals with a mean age of 35.15 (SD = 11.44). They participated in the study by completing an online questionnaire to assess the study variables. Most of the participants reported being diagnosed with Asperger syndrome (63.6%) or Level 1 autism spectrum disorder (27.1%).\nThe model fit index values tested through path analysis indicated a good fit (\u03c7\nThese findings highlight the importance of worry and intolerance of uncertainty as specific targets in interventions aimed at improving stress and anxiety problems in autistic adults.",

        "abstract": "This study evaluates the neuropsychological profiles of three adolescent females with suspected Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). The study was conducted at My Blue Side, a support organization in Southern Tenerife. The research included a detailed assessment using standardized neuropsychological tests to identify the neuropsychological characteristics associated with ASD in adolescent females. The primary objective was to delineate the neuropsychological profile of each participant and its relationship with their daily functioning. Three participants underwent a comprehensive neuropsychological assessment incorporating the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised (ADI-R), the Autonomous Scale for the Detection of Asperger Syndrome and High-Functioning Autism, the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC-V), the D2 test, Five-Digit Test (FDT), Spain-Complutense Verbal Learning Test (TAVCI), Rey Complex Figure (RCF) and Executive Functioning Questionnaire (EFECO). The study design aimed to provide a thorough understanding of each participant's neuropsychological profile and its potential impact on their daily functioning. The results indicated significant ASD markers across the participants, with substantial variability in neuropsychological capabilities, particularly in working memory and executive functioning. These deficits impacted daily functioning and emotional regulation. The assessments also highlighted challenges in verbal and visual learning, as well as difficulties with spontaneous recall. These findings underscore the need for interventions to consider these neuropsychological characteristics and their relationship with the daily challenges faced by females with ASD and their families, beyond the core symptoms of the disorder.",

        "abstract": "The etiology of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) has not yet been completely elucidated. Through time, multiple attempts have been made to uncover the causes of ASD. Different theories have been proposed, such as being caused by alterations in the gut-brain axis with an emphasis on gut dysbiosis, post-vaccine complications, and genetic or even autoimmune causes. In this review, we present data covering the main streams that focus on ASD etiology. Data collection occurred in many countries covering ethnically diverse subjects. Moreover, we aimed to show how the progress in genetic techniques influences the explanation of medical White Papers in the ASD area. There is no single evidence-based pathway that results in symptoms of ASD. Patient management has constantly only been symptomatic, and there is no ASD screening apart from symptom-based diagnosis and parent-mediated interventions. Multigene sequencing or epigenetic alterations hold promise in solving the disjointed molecular puzzle. Further research is needed, especially in the field of biogenetics and metabolomic aspects, because young children constitute the patient group most affected by ASD. In summary, to date, molecular research has confirmed multigene dysfunction as the causative factor of ASD, the multigene model with metabolomic influence would explain the heterogeneity in ASD, and it is proposed that ion channel dysfunction could play a core role in ASD pathogenesis.",

        "doi": "10.7759/cureus.67819",
        "abstract": "Background Neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) encompass intricate interactions among genetic, brain, cognitive, emotional, and behavioral processes. These disorders, which are influenced by hereditary and environmental factors, impair personal, social, intellectual, or occupational functioning. Typically emerging early in life, NDDs include conditions such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), intellectual disability, autism spectrum disorders (ASDs), vision and hearing impairments, motor disorders, and specific learning disabilities. Children from impoverished and low-income neighborhoods are particularly vulnerable. The lack of comprehensive health data and public awareness about these conditions results in limited information regarding the prevalence of neurological illnesses in developing countries. India, with its large and ethnically diverse population, exemplifies this gap. Methods It is a prospective study to detect the prevalence and risk factors of neurodevelopmental disorders in children aged six months to nine years at a tertiary care center. Patient details, clinical findings, and relevant history were recorded on a pre-designed pro forma and analyzed statistically. Results Among the 1000 children in the study, 91 (9.1%) tested positive for NDDs. Among the 91 children who tested positive for NDD, the highest frequency is in the three to four years age group (17.6%), males were found to be in a higher ratio with 75.82%, with the male: female ratio being 3:1. Among the 91 children with NDD, intellectual disability was the most common disorder (20.9%), followed by ADHD (17.6%) and vision impairment (14.3%). Autism spectrum disorders, including autism and Asperger syndrome, and communication disorders, including stuttering and speech disorders, accounted for 13.2% each. Hearing loss was seen in 9.9% of children and multiple disorders were seen in 8.8% of the children from among 91 children. Conclusion Neurodevelopmental disorders are common and often coexist with other conditions. Children from low-income backgrounds are more affected. This study provides valuable insights into the prevalence and characteristics of NDDs in a specific population.",

However, children with the condition then known as Asperger syndrome are known to have difficulties in comprehending sarcasm, even if they possess adequate verbal IQs for understanding metaphors. Accordingly, researchers had employed a screening test that assesses metaphor and sarcasm comprehension to distinguish Asperger syndrome from other conditions with similar external behaviors (e.g., attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder). This study employs a standardized test to evaluate recent large language models' (LLMs) understanding of nuanced human communication. The results indicate improved metaphor comprehension with increased model parameters; however, no similar improvement was observed for sarcasm comprehension. Considering that a human's ability to grasp sarcasm has been associated with the amygdala, a pivotal cerebral region for emotional learning, a distinctive strategy for training LLMs would be imperative to imbue them with the ability in a cognitively grounded manner.",

        "abstract": "Mesomelia-Synostoses Syndrome (MSS)(OMIM 600,383) is a rare autosomal dominant disorder characterized by mesomelic limb shortening, acral synostoses and multiple congenital malformations which is described as a contiguous deletion syndrome involving the two genes SULF1 and SLCO5A1. The study of apparently balanced chromosomal rearrangements (BCRs) is a cytogenetic strategy used to identify candidate genes associated with Mendelian diseases or abnormal phenotypes. With the improved development of genomic technologies, new methods refine this search, allowing better delineation of breakpoints as well as more accurate genotype-phenotype correlation.\nWe present a boy with a global development deficit, delayed speech development and an ASD (Asperger) family history, with an apparently balanced \"de novo\" reciprocal translocation [t(1;8)(p32.2;q13)dn]. The cytogenetic molecular study identified a likely pathogenic deletion of 21\u00a0kb in the 15q12 region, while mate pair sequencing identified gene-truncations at both the 1p32.2 and 8q13 translocation breakpoints.\nThe identification of a pathogenic alteration on 15q12 involving GABRA5 was likely the main cause of the ASD-phenotype. Importantly, the chr8 translocation breakpoint truncating SLCO5A1 exclude SLCO5A1 as a candidate for MSS, leaving SULF1 as the primary candidate. However, the deletions observed in MSS remove a topological associated domain (TAD) boundary separating SULF1 and SLCO5A1. Hence, Mesomelia-Synostoses syndrome is either caused by haploinsufficiency of SULF1 or ectopic enhancer effects where skeletal/chrondrogenic SULF1 enhancers drive excopic expression of developmental genes in adjacent TADs including PRDM14, NCOA2 and/or EYA1.",

However, differences in child development related to culture, genetics, and perinatal outcomes may impact tool applicability. This study evaluated the validity, reliability, and accessibility of multidomain developmental screening tools for young children, analyzed the applicability of tools across different contexts, and created a compendium of tools. Employing adapted realist review methods, we searched APA PsycInfo, MEDLINE, CINAHL, ERIC, and Google to identify relevant articles and information. We assessed accessibility, validity, reliability, and contextual applicability (N = 4110 evidence sources) to create tool ratings and make recommendations. Of 33 identified tools, 22 were screening and 11 were assessment tools. Fewer screening tools than assessment tools were rated highly overall. Evidence for use in different cultures was often lacking for both types of tools. The ASQ (screening) and BDI (assessment) tools were rated most favorably and are recommended for use, though other tools may be more applicable in different contexts (e.g., NEPSY among children with Asperger's Syndrome). Future research should focus on assessing the validity and reliability of tools across different demographics to increase accessibility and ensure all children are properly supported.",

        "doi": "10.5014/ajot.2024.050502",
        "abstract": "Since the first descriptions of autism, difficulties with affective contact (e.g., interpersonal exchanges of feelings between individuals) have been considered a common feature of autism spectrum disorder, and these difficulties frequently manifest in occupational therapy interventions.\nTo (1) explore how autistic young adults describe their emotions and (2) suggest ways to improve the affective contact between autistic clients and their therapists.\nVirtual focus group interviews.\nOnline (Qualtrics) survey and Zoom focus groups.\nAutistic adults (N = 24) who met the following inclusion criteria: self-reported diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder or Asperger syndrome, age 18-35 yr, able to understand English, and able to participate in a focus group or individual interview using verbal or written communication.\nTwo themes were noted and are presented in this article: (1) Autistic people experience complex emotions and (2) autistic people's emotions are often (mis)measured and (mis)understood.\nThe findings indicate that autistic people experience diverse, complex, and intense emotions and that these are connected to occupation. This suggests that occupational therapists must be attuned to the emotional dimension of occupation when working with autistic clients and that autistic clients may benefit from the use of embodied language to reference their emotions. Occupational therapists can help autistic clients recognize their bodily changes when experiencing emotions and to better identify and regulate their emotions. The results also show that there were many cases nonautistic people misinterpreted the emotions of autistic people on the basis of their facial expressions or words. Plain-Language Summary: This article provides information about the emotional experiences of autistic people. The study found that autistic people experience complex emotions and that those emotions are often misinterpreted or misunderstood. The author provides information on how occupational therapists can use a neurodiversity-affirming and person-centered approach to support the emotional experiences of people in the autism community. Positionality Statement: In this article, identity-first language is used when referring to autistic adults. This deliberate choice aligns with the principles of the neurodiversity-affirming movement. Autistic self-advocates have indicated a preference for this style of language over person-first language. The author would also like to acknowledge their positionality. As both a neurodivergent researcher and a self-advocate for the disabled community, this style of language aligns with their own experiences of and beliefs about their disability.",

At a time when autism spectrum disorder faces many challenges (e.g. the nature and measurement of autism), this text tells us more about the particular population that Asperger worked with. He describes sensitive, intelligent, creative and rational children, a far cry from the Wing triad. Moreover, 'Asperger's Syndrome' was introduced after he had died, was included in the DSM-IV in 1994 and was omitted from the DSM-5 in 2013. The question posed by this last text, written before his death, is whether Asperger's descriptions of autistic children are really part of the autism spectrum disorder or whether they are outside the pathological field.",

        "doi": "10.3390/cimb46040194",
        "abstract": "Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder that includes autism, Asperger's syndrome, and pervasive developmental disorder. Individuals with ASD may exhibit difficulties in social interactions, communication challenges, repetitive behaviors, and restricted interests. While genetic mutations in individuals with ASD can either activate or inactivate the activities of the gene product, impacting neuronal morphogenesis and causing symptoms, the underlying mechanism remains to be fully established. Herein, for the first time, we report that genetically conserved Rac1 guanine-nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) Dock5 signalosome molecules control process elongation in the N1E-115 cell line, a model line capable of achieving neuronal morphological changes. The increased elongation phenotypes observed in ASD and intellectual disability (ID)-associated Semaphorin-5A (Sema5A) Arg676-to-Cys [p.R676C] were also mediated by Dock5 signalosome molecules. Indeed, knockdown of Dock5 using clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)/CasRx-based guide(g)RNA specifically recovered the mutated Sema5A-induced increase in process elongation in cells. Knockdown of Elmo2, an adaptor molecule of Dock5, also exhibited similar recovery. Comparable results were obtained when transfecting the interaction region of Dock5 with Elmo2. The activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), one of the primary signal transduction molecules underlying process elongation, was ameliorated by either their knockdown or transfection. These results suggest that the Dock5 signalosome comprises abnormal signaling involved in the process elongation induced by ASD- and ID-associated Sema5A. These molecules could be added to the list of potential therapeutic target molecules for abnormal neuronal morphogenesis in ASD at the molecular and cellular levels.",

        "abstract": "Patients with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) experience higher rates of perioperative anxiety and are likely to receive premedication. Little is known about nonpharmaceutical interventions which may decrease anxiety. This study aims to evaluate the use of an adaptive sensory environment (ASE) to reduce ASD patient anxiety during the perioperative process.\nOur feasibility study (ClinicalTrials.govNCT04994613) enrolled 60 patients in two parallel groups randomized to a control (no ASE) or intervention group (ASE). We included all surgical patients aged three to twelve years, with a formal diagnosis of ASD, Asperger's Syndrome, or pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified. Preoperative behaviors were recorded by an unblinded nurse utilizing the validated Modified Yale Preoperative Anxiety Scale (mYPAS). The difference in score on the mYPAS was the primary outcome, and an intention-to-treat analysis was employed. A generalized estimating equations model was used to compare mYPAS scores controlling for significant independent variables.\n58 patients were analyzed after 1:1 randomization of 30 patients to each group. Groups were balanced except the median number of intraoperative pain medications was significantly lower in the ASE group (1 vs. 3, p\u00a0=\u00a00.012). Mean (SD) age for all patients was 7.2 (2.9) years, range 2.6-12.7. 72.4% (42/58) were White and all were Non-Hispanic or Latino. 74% were Male (21/30 ASE and 22/28 Control) and 26% were Female (9/30 ASE and 6/28 Control). No differences were found in mYPAS scores between groups at three time periods (43.5 vs. 42, p\u00a0=\u00a00.88, 47.8 vs. 48.4, p\u00a0=\u00a00.76, and 36.4 vs. 43.8, p\u00a0=\u00a00.15, ASE vs. control group, respectively). The ASE group had a significant within-group decrease in mYPAS scores from nursing intake to transition (p\u00a0=\u00a00.030).\nAn ASE did not significantly reduce perioperative anxiety.

Unrecognized ASD is likely to be mislabeled as a psychotic disorder (PD), as people in the spectrum may show 'pseudopsychotic' symptoms, resembling both negative and positive symptoms. On the other hand, PDs are likely to be overlooked when they arise in people with ASD, due to the 'diagnostic overshadowing' of new-onset conditions by lifelong core autistic symptoms. The three available metanalyses on the occurrence of psychosis in adults with ASD convergently reported a rate of PDs that is at least ten times higher than in the general population. Therefore, the lack of literature addressing risk factors, outcomes, and treatment options for psychosis in the context of ASD is utterly concerning.

The nature of the disorder in the patient is related to the sinking into fantasies, and not typical obsessions as in OCD. The patient was previously treated with drugs from the SSRI group, neuroleptics (without aripiprazole) and methylphenidate. Only methylphenidate showed some improvement; however, it made the patient feel \u201fstiff in thinking\". The patient was hospitalized because of a suicide attempt, which, as it later turned out, was self-harm with no intention of killing himself. During hospitalization, a differential diagnosis was performed and the diagnosis of Asperger's syndrome was made, which was accompanied by immersion in the world of one's fantasies and stereotypical behavior. The patient was administered aripiprazole at a dose of 15 mg/d and after three weeks, a significant improvement in health was achieved, including a reduction in the duration of episodes from several hours to several dozen seconds. The drug is well tolerated by the patient. The patient was discharged from the hospital and continues his school education. In the article, we present single case reports in which similar spectacular results were achieved in similar cases. We also describe a possible physiological explanation for this response to this drug.",

        "abstract": "Autistic adults often report high levels of social anxiety and significant life impacts from this anxiety on well-being and functioning. Although cognitive-behavioural therapy in group settings has been adapted for autistic populations, there is a paucity of research exploring how autistic individuals experience CBT interventions. This qualitative study investigated autistic adults' experiences of a modified cognitive-behavioural therapy group programme for social anxiety. Twenty-seven autistic participants were recruited through clinical services and community outreach. Following the intervention, participants completed semi-structured individual interviews about their experience of the programme. Participants reported both therapeutic benefits and challenges following their participation. Themes included reflections on group dynamics, mental health impacts, social functioning and daily life applications of strategies. Peer connection emerged as a core facilitator of engagement, while structured strategies were credited with bolstering social confidence and self-awareness. However, challenges, such as sensory sensitivities, the role of previous therapeutic experiences and difficulties applying strategies beyond the therapy context, were also highlighted.Lay AbstractAutistic adults often report high levels of social anxiety. To support autistic people with social anxiety, we developed a group therapy programme, the Engage Program, an intervention designed specifically for autistic adults. Our study aimed to better understand what it is like for autistic adults to take part in group therapy and what aspects of the programme were most helpful, or not. The programme aimed to provide a safe space where participants could explore social interactions in a way that felt comfortable and authentic. Rather than encouraging people to hide or 'camouflage' their autistic traits, the programme focused on building confidence, self-understanding and meaningful connections with peers. Sessions included guided discussions, structured activities and shared experiences. We interviewed participants who had completed the group programme to hear directly from them about their experiences. Many said they felt less alone and more socially confident after taking part in the group. They appreciated connecting with others who understood their experiences, and they said this helped them feel more accepted and supported. They also reported that participating in the group helped them understand their social strengths and challenges more clearly. However, not everything worked for everyone. Some participants found aspects of the therapy challenging, especially if they had sensory sensitivities or difficult past experiences with therapy. In the future, we want to explore how to make group therapy more flexible and accessible, especially for those who may struggle in traditional settings. This research shows that group therapy can be a powerful way to support autistic adults, especially when it is designed with their needs and preferences in mind.",

        "doi": "10.3389/fpsyt.2025.1630782",
        "abstract": "There is growing evidence that exosomes play an important role in the pathogenesis of central nervous system diseases, but little is known about the relationship between exosomes and autism spectrum disorder (ASD).\nIn this study, a rat model of ASD was generated via prenatal exposure to valproic acid (VPA). Three-chamber social interaction, self-grooming and marble burying tests were utilized for behavioral assessment. The plasma exosomal microRNA (miRNA) expression profiles of VPA-treated rats and sham rats were analyzed. Interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) and IL-1\u03b2 levels were measured by ELISA. miR-30b-5p in the brains was assessed by qRT-PCR. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), p-p38/p38, and CaMKII were assessed by Western blot. In addition, the regulation of miR-30b-5p/EGFR was examined by lateral ventricle injection with miR-30b-5p agomir in VPA-exposed rats.\nVPA-exposed rats exhibited ASD-like behaviors. The level of miR-30b-5p was significantly lower in the plasma exosomes and brains of VPA-exposed rats than in those of sham rats. In addition, the levels of inflammatory factors, EGFR, p-p38/p38, and CaMKII were increased in the brains of VPA-exposed rats. Moreover, overexpressing miR-30b-5p ameliorated ASD-like behaviors and decreased the expression of inflammatory factors, EGFR, p-p38/p38, and CaMKII in the brains of VPA-exposed rats.\nOur study highlights that plasma exosomal miR-30b-5p attenuates neuroinflammation in a rat model of ASD by modulating EGFR through the MAPK signaling pathway and calcium signaling pathway. This study provides novel perspectives on plasma exosomal miR-30b-5p, which could be considered a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of ASD in the clinic.",

        "doi": "10.1111/scs.70139",
        "abstract": "Nursing care aims to promote health and well-being among patients, but if nurses are to meet this requirement, they need to know the needs of the individual. Among autistic patients, health and well-being may be promoted using factors other than those used among other groups, indicating that their care needs may also differ.\nThe aim of the study was to investigate what autistic adults need if they are to experience health and well-being. The aim was also to evaluate how nurses can use this information in nursing care based on the Fundamentals of Care framework.\nThis was a qualitative-theoretical descriptive study incorporating elements of netnography. Podcasts in which autistic individuals discuss their health and well-being were listened to and qualitatively analyzed to address the first part of the aim. The Fundamentals of Care framework was then used to demonstrate how results from the first part of the aim could be applied in nursing care to meet the care needs of autistic patients.\nThe study reveals that when autistic adults speak freely about their life, they mention interests, pride, being a support to others, satisfying the body's needs, health-promoting places, being alone, experiencing straightforward communication, receiving support from others and having routines as important to their health and well-being. All of these aspects are relevant to consider when trying to meet autistic patients' nursing care needs. For example, minimizing sensory impressions and being able to have routines are important to physical well-being.\nThe study reveals that adult autistic individuals may have partly different nursing care needs compared to most patients. Nurses can meet autistic patients' needs using the Fundamentals of Care framework, adapted to autistic individuals, as a guide.\nThis study only involves public data and has not recruited any participants. However, the researcher has autism herself and is well-versed in the research field and the knowledge development desired by the international autistic community.",

        "abstract": "The dearth of tools to quantify and track growth in social communication ability has been a barrier to understanding and monitoring treatment outcomes for neurodevelopmental disorders. We undertook a multi-staged, multisite study to create the Developmental Assessment of Social Communication Ability (DASCA), a new measure explicitly developed as a clinical outcome assessment for monitoring change-both over the course of development and in response to treatment.\nThe DASCA is a caregiver-report instrument created using a mixed-methods approach. Qualitative components of this approach included focus groups and cognitive debriefing interviews. Quantitative components included dimensionality analysis, differential item functioning, and item response theory modeling. The item bank was iteratively refined to assess social communication skills that are typically acquired by early- to middle- childhood.\nThe final DASCA item bank contains 184 items. Expressive language was a major factor in determining the appropriateness of some items for certain groups of children. Negligible differential item functioning, primarily by age, was observed for some items. However, impact analyses determined that this differential item functioning did not meaningfully impact overall scores.\nGiven that sample size limitations prevented us from using separate samples for exploratory and confirmatory phases of modeling, it will be important to gather additional validity evidence in independent samples, especially as the current data were collected during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe DASCA holds promise as an outcome measure for assessing changes in social communication ability. Ongoing development efforts include creating a computer adaptive test administration to allow for serial assessments using different item sets to yield a consistent score that is sensitive to change.",

Furthermore, we assessed oxidative DNA damage by Single Cell Gel Electrophoresis. The evaluation of oxidative stress markers indicated a mild oxidative stress status and a higher level of DNA damage in nuclei of ASD patients' lymphocytes. We found significant associations between ASD and several polymorphisms of genes involved in the detoxification and the response to oxidative stress.

Five months following the 1998 ice storm in Quebec, we recruited women who had been pregnant during the crisis and assessed their PNMS: objective hardship, subjective distress, and cognitive appraisal. At age 13, their children provided blood samples for DNA. At ages 15, 16 and 19, the youth self-reported their own autistic-like traits using the Broad Autism Phenotype Questionnaire.

        "doi": "10.3390/ijms26199391",
        "abstract": "Neuronutrition to improve brain resilience to stress and human health has received considerable attention. The use of specific nutrients is effective in preventing and slowing neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric disorders. Selective neuronutrients, including polyphenols, short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), tryptophan, tyrosine, and sulfur metabolites, can modulate the dysregulated nuclear factor erythroid 2 (Nrf2) pathway through neuroepigenetic modifications and altered levels of neurotransmitters such as serotonin, melatonin, and dopamine. In particular, abnormal epigenetic alterations in the promoter function of the NFE2L2/Nrf2 gene may contribute to the onset and progression of various diseases by disrupting cellular homeostasis. Recent evidence has documented that polyphenols are capable of modulating Nrf2 signaling; to do this, they must reverse hypermethylation in the CpG islands of the NFE2L2 gene. This process is achieved by modifying the activity of DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) and histone deacetylases (HDACs). Furthermore, a diverse group of polyphenolic metabolites can be identified and quantified using innovative mass spectrometry platforms in both in vitro models and human urine samples to investigate redox metabolic homeostasis under physiological and pathophysiological conditions. This review aims to deepen the current understanding of the role of nutrient-derived secondary metabolites. It highlights innovative strategies to effectively prevent, slow, or potentially reverse neuroinflammation and oxidative stress, key drivers of neuronal damage. The targeted application of these metabolites can be considered a novel, personalized neuronutritional approach to promote brain health and neuronal adaptation.",

The identification of GI problems in individuals with ASD is challenging due to their altered pain perception and irregular behaviors. Importantly, GI symptoms and ASD can potentially aggravate each other. However, it is unclear if GI problems cause ASD symptoms or vice versa. A crosstalk between the digestive system, gut microbiota, and the central and enteric nervous systems (CNS and ENS, respectively) has been repeatedly reported. The ENS regulates the GI tract with the CNS and the autonomic nervous system (ANS), as well as independently through specific neural circuits. Several mechanisms contribute to GI problems in ASD, including genetic mutations that affect the ENS, dysregulation of the ANS, alterations in gut microbiota, unhealthy dietary preferences, and changes in metabolomic profiles. Furthermore, studies have shown molecular and cellular differences in the GI biopsy of children with and without ASD. These findings highlight the unique nature of GI issues in ASD, underscoring the importance of further investigating the changes that occur in the digestive system and ENS in ASD models.",

        "title": "Global age-sex-specific all-cause mortality and life expectancy estimates for 204 countries and territories and 660 subnational locations, 1950-2023: a demographic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2023.",
        "doi": "10.1016/S0140-6736(25)01330-3",
        "abstract": "Comprehensive, comparable, and timely estimates of demographic metrics-including life expectancy and age-specific mortality-are essential for evaluating, understanding, and addressing trends in population health. The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the importance of timely and all-cause mortality estimates for being able to respond to changing trends in health outcomes, showing a strong need for demographic analysis tools that can produce all-cause mortality estimates more rapidly with more readily available all-age vital registration (VR) data. The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) is an ongoing research effort that quantifies human health by estimating a range of epidemiological quantities of interest across time, age, sex, location, cause, and risk. This study-part of the latest GBD release, GBD 2023-aims to provide new and updated estimates of all-cause mortality and life expectancy for 1950 to 2023 using a novel statistical model that accounts for complex correlation structures in demographic data across age and time.\nWe used 24\u2008025 data sources from VR, sample registration, surveys, censuses, and other sources to estimate all-cause mortality for males, females, and all sexes combined across 25 age groups in 204 countries and territories as well as 660 subnational units in 20 countries and territories, for the years 1950-2023. For the first time, we used complete birth history data for ages 5-14 years, age-specific sibling history data for ages 15-49 years, and age-specific mortality data from Health and Demographic Surveillance Systems. We developed a single statistical model that incorporates both parametric and non-parametric methods, referred to as OneMod, to produce estimates of all-cause mortality for each age-sex-location group. OneMod includes two main steps: a detailed regression analysis with a generalised linear modelling tool that accounts for age-specific covariate effects such as the Socio-demographic Index (SDI) and a population attributable fraction (PAF) for all risk factors combined; and a non-parametric analysis of residuals using a multivariate kernel regression model that smooths across age and time to adaptably follow trends in the data without overfitting. We calibrated asymptotic uncertainty estimates using Pearson residuals to produce 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs) and corresponding 1000 draws. Life expectancy was calculated from age-specific mortality rates with standard demographic methods. For each measure, 95% UIs were calculated with the 25th and 975th ordered values from a 1000-draw posterior distribution.\nIn 2023, 60\u00b71 million (95% UI 59\u00b70-61\u00b71) deaths occurred globally, of which 4\u00b767 million (4\u00b759-4\u00b775) were in children younger than 5 years. Due to considerable population growth and ageing since 1950, the number of annual deaths globally increased by 35\u00b72% (32\u00b72-38\u00b74) over the 1950-2023 study period, during which the global age-standardised all-cause mortality rate declined by 66\u00b76% (65\u00b78-67\u00b73). Trends in age-specific mortality rates between 2011 and 2023 varied by age group and location, with the largest decline in under-5 mortality occurring in east Asia (67\u00b77% decrease); the largest increases in mortality for those aged 5-14 years, 25-29 years, and 30-39 years occurring in high-income North America (11\u00b75%, 31\u00b77%, and 49\u00b79%, respectively); and the largest increases in mortality for those aged 15-19 years and 20-24 years occurring in Eastern Europe (53\u00b79% and 40\u00b71%, respectively). We also identified higher than previously estimated mortality rates in sub-Saharan Africa for all sexes combined aged 5-14 years (87\u00b73% higher in GBD 2023 than GBD 2021 on average across countries and territories over the 1950-2021 period) and for females aged 15-29 years (61\u00b72% higher), as well as lower than previously estimated mortality rates in sub-Saharan Africa for all sexes combined aged 50 years and older (13\u00b72% lower), reflecting advances in our modelling approach. Global life expectancy followed three distinct trends over the study period. First, between 1950 and 2019, there were considerable improvements, from 51\u00b72 (50\u00b76-51\u00b77) years for females and 47\u00b79 (47\u00b74-48\u00b74) years for males in 1950 to 76\u00b73 (76\u00b72-76\u00b74) years for females and 71\u00b74 (71\u00b73-71\u00b75) years for males in 2019. Second, this period was followed by a decrease in life expectancy during the COVID-19 pandemic, to 74\u00b77 (74\u00b76-74\u00b78) years for females and 69\u00b73 (69\u00b72-69\u00b74) years for males in 2021. Finally, the world experienced a period of post-pandemic recovery in 2022 and 2023, wherein life expectancy generally returned to pre-pandemic (2019) levels in 2023 (76\u00b73 [76\u00b70-76\u00b76] years for females and 71\u00b75 [71\u00b72-71\u00b78] years for males). 194 (95\u00b71%) of 204 countries and territories experienced at least partial post-pandemic recovery in age-standardised mortality rates by 2023, with 61\u00b78% (126 of 204) recovering to or falling below pre-pandemic levels. There were several mortality trajectories during and following the pandemic across countries and territories. Long-term mortality trends also varied considerably between age groups and locations, demonstrating the diverse landscape of health outcomes globally.\nThis analysis identified several key differences in mortality trends from previous estimates, including higher rates of adolescent mortality, higher rates of young adult mortality in females, and lower rates of mortality in older age groups in much of sub-Saharan Africa. The findings also highlight stark differences across countries and territories in the timing and scale of changes in all-cause mortality trends during and following the COVID-19 pandemic (2020-23). Our estimates of evolving trends in mortality and life expectancy across locations, ages, sexes, and SDI levels in recent years as well as over the entire 1950-2023 study period provide crucial information for governments, policy makers, and the public to ensure that health-care systems, economies, and societies are prepared to address the world's health needs, particularly in populations with higher rates of mortality than previously known. The estimates from this study provide a robust framework for GBD and a valuable foundation for policy development, implementation, and evaluation around the world.\nGates Foundation.",

This systematic review assesses the efficacy of microbiota-based interventions, including probiotics, prebiotics, synbiotics, and fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), in improving ASD-related symptoms, aiming to provide insights into their therapeutic potential and inform future clinical applications.\nA comprehensive systematic review was conducted following PRISMA guidelines and registered in PROSPERO (CRD42024615043). A structured literature search was performed in PubMed, Cochrane Library, and Scopus to identify peer-reviewed English-language studies. Eligible studies included randomized controlled trials (RCTs), non-randomized trials (NRTs), and retrospective studies assessing the impact of microbiota-based interventions on ASD-related behavioral and GI outcomes. Two independent reviewers conducted study selection, data extraction, and quality assessment using standardized risk-of-bias tools.\n33 studies were included, consisting of 16 RCTs, 14 NRTs, and 3 retrospective studies. Among them, 15 assessed probiotics, 4 prebiotics, 5 synbiotics, and 9 FMT. Probiotics showed moderate behavioral improvements in ASD, with multi-strain formulations being more effective than single strains. Prebiotics and synbiotics yielded mixed results, with some studies indicating benefits in behavioral and GI symptoms. FMT demonstrated the most consistent and sustained improvements in both ASD-related behaviors and GI function. Adverse events were minimal, primarily involving transient GI symptoms.\nMicrobiota-targeted interventions, particularly FMT, hold promise for managing ASD symptoms, though probiotics, prebiotics, and synbiotics present variable efficacy. Standardized protocols, larger controlled trials, and personalized microbiome-based approaches are necessary to refine these therapeutic strategies and enhance clinical applicability.\nhttps://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO/view/CRD42024615043, identifier CRD42024615043.",

        "abstract": "The development of good-quality sleep is very important in early life. Sleep promotion programs aim to increase preterm infants' sleep quality because preterm infants in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) have poor sleep. Interestingly, the majority of preterm infants are treated with caffeine, a nervous system stimulant. The primary objective of this systematic review was therefore to appraise the current evidence concerning potentially sleep-disruptive effects of caffeine in preterm infants within the first month of life. We performed a search (PROSPERO protocol CRD42022273596) according to PRISMA guidelines in PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and PsycInfo (as well as CENTRAL). We looked for studies involving preterm infants (<37 weeks of gestational age) treated with caffeine in the NICU, with sleep measures acquired within the first month of life. Eight studies met the eligibility criteria. Underlying effect sizes for main outcomes are represented using albatross plots. Among studies reporting on wakefulness (N = 213), 83.33% detected significant disruptions (P < \u00a0.05). Among studies reporting on sensorimotor functioning (N = 80), 100% detected significant reductions (P < \u00a0.05). Moreover, significant reductions (P < \u00a0.05) in sleep states were detected. Available evidence suggests that caffeine exposure in preterm infants may produce alterations in sleep-wake and sensorimotor functioning, and related processes during the first month of life. The overall evidence is mixed, with some studies reporting no effect of caffeine exposure on neonatal sleep. Additional research is needed to understand how caffeine alters the quality of neonatal sleep in preterm infants and whether the effects may differ among infant subgroups. There is a continued need to investigate and support sleep quality in preterm infants during their NICU stay.",

        "abstract": "Pathogenic variants in the KCNQ2 gene, which encodes a potassium channel subunit, are associated with neonatal seizures, epileptic encephalopathy, intellectual disability, and autism. Although the consequences of disrupted KCNQ2 channel function have been studied in the past, the detailed molecular mechanisms underlying the development of neurological phenotypes remain unclear, and neuronal models of specific patient variants are lacking. We generated patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from fibroblasts from three individuals with distinct KCNQ2 pathogenic variants. We corrected the KCNQ2 variants using CRISPR-Cas9 editing to create isogenic controls and differentiated these iPSCs into glutamatergic neurons to study the effects of each variant on neuronal function. The three KCNQ2 variants were: 1) KCNQ2 c.875_877delTCCinsCCT, L292_L293delinsPF, 2) KCNQ2 c.766G\u00a0>\u00a0T, G256W, and 3) KCNQ2 c.821C\u00a0>\u00a0T, T274M. Our data revealed longer neurite outgrowth in two patient lines (T274M and G256W). Transcriptional profiling showed that all three KCNQ2 lines co-expressed genes enriched in synaptic transmission/signaling, cell adhesion, and GTPase signal transduction. Functional analyses of neuronal networks revealed increased burst duration in all three KCNQ2 lines compared with their isogenic controls. Furthermore, neurons from the L292_L293delinsPF and T274M lines displayed increased network connectivity associated with increased density of synaptic markers. Finally, we detected hyperexcitable neuronal networks in the G256W line with electrical stimulation of the neural networks on a high-density microelectrode array, and this phenotype was rescued with retigabine. These disease-related phenotypes for each of the KCNQ2 pathogenic variants can be used for drug screening to identify treatment options for the patients.",

        "abstract": "Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) has emerged as a valuable tool for investigating neurobiological markers in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). While previous studies have identified abnormal functional connectivity in ASD children compared to typically developing (TD) peers, brain connectivity dynamics and their associations with autism symptoms and cognitive abilities remain underexplored. We analyzed fNIRS data from 44 children (30 boys, 21 ASD/23 TD) aged 2.08-6.67 years while they viewed a silent cartoon. Using sliding window correlation and k-means clustering, we assessed group differences in dynamic connectivity and the correlations with symptom severity and cognitive performance. Our results revealed that children with ASD showed reduced dwell time in a specific brain state and fewer state transitions compared to TD children. These atypical brain state patterns were negatively correlated with autism symptom severity and positively correlated with adaptive behavior and cognitive performance across participants. Mediation analysis revealed that adaptive behavior fully mediated the relationship between brain dynamics and cognitive performance. Furthermore, dynamic connectivity features achieved 74.4% accuracy in distinguishing ASD from TD children. Importantly, the link between brain dynamics and cognitive performance was replicated in an independent TD sample, underscoring the robustness of this finding. Together, these findings highlight altered brain dynamics in young children with ASD and underscore the critical role of adaptive behavior in bridging neural activity and cognitive performance. These insights advance our understanding of neural mechanisms underlying ASD and point to potential pathways for early interventions and clinical applications.",

        "abstract": "Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a developmental condition characterized by difficulties in social interaction, communication, and sensory processing. The ability to orient towards sounds is a key component of social interactions, yet auditory spatial attention remains relatively understudied in ASD, despite prior research indicating differences in this domain. Here, we investigate the neural signatures associated with passive auditory spatial attention in children with ASD (n\u2009=\u200921, ages 6-17) relative to age- and IQ-matched Typically Developing (TD) children (n\u2009=\u200931), using source-localized magnetoencephalography (MEG). Participants listened passively, while watching a silenced movie, to non-social auditory stimuli designed to either remain lateralized to one hemifield (stay trials) or to change in location from one side to the contralateral hemifield (jump trials). Linear mixed effects modeling showed lower cortical activation in the auditory cortex in the ASD group in response to jump trials, relative to the TD group. Additionally, functional connectivity analyses showed higher alpha-band functional connectivity in the ASD group between left auditory cortex seeds and right prefrontal and left parietal regions known to be recruited during auditory spatial attention. Right prefrontal alpha-band connectivity estimates were associated with behaviorally assessed auditory processing scores, whereas left parietal connectivity estimates were associated with ASD symptomatology. Our results align with the hypothesis that auditory spatial attention generally, and specifically orientation to sounds even when experienced passively, differs in ASD versus TD children.",

        "abstract": "Oxytocin (OXT), a neuropeptide hormone essential to a wide range of social functions, has drawn increasing attention as a crucial contributor to the neurobiology of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Central OXT system disruptions have been reported\u00a0in several genetic mouse models of ASD; however, a detailed and systematic characterization of these phenotypes, and cross-model identification of shared and distinct features, are presently lacking. We integrated whole-brain OXT immunolabeling, SHIELD tissue clearing, light-sheet microscopy, and three-dimensional (3D) machine learning-based cell detection to establish a high-throughput, intact-tissue pipeline and quantified OXT immunopositive (OXT+) neurons across subregions of the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN) in two genetic mouse models of ASD: Cntnap2 and Fmr1 knockout (KO) mice. We validated this pipeline alongside conventional immunohistochemistry using tissue sections. We show subregion- and sex-specific differences in PVN OXT+ cell counts in the two KO models. Notably, whole-PVN analysis revealed additional subregion- and sex-specific differences that were not evident in section-based quantification. These results identify subregion- and sex-specific differences in PVN OXT+ neuronal distribution as a shared phenotype in two genetic mouse models of ASD. This work highlights the importance of region-specific, high-resolution 3D approaches in intact tissue for quantifying cell populations within anatomically complex brain regions.",

        "abstract": "The thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN) is a critical inhibitory structure in the thalamocortical network, playing key roles in sensory processing, attention, cognitive flexibility, and sleep rhythms; importantly these functions are altered in autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The TRN consists mainly of two neuronal subpopulations: first order (FO) neurons, which modulate sensory relay nuclei, and higher-order (HO) neurons, which control associative thalamic circuits. TRN-FO neurons are located in the core region, show a high expression of repetitive burst firing, and are known to contribute to slow-wave oscillations. In contrast, neurons innervating HO thalamic nuclei are in the anterior and peripheral regions of the TRN and have fewer burst firing. These subpopulations provide specialized inhibition to thalamus, but their alterations in ASD have rarely been explored. We evaluated the reticular inhibitory system in thalamic nuclei (FO and HO) in Shank3 KO mice, a well-established monogenic model of ASD. We analyzed electrophysiological properties of targeted TRN neurons, our results show that TRN neurons projecting to FO and HO nuclei exhibit differential changes in Shank3 KO mice, including decreased burst firing in FO projecting neurons, which is crucial for maintaining sleep architecture. Additionally, we examined spontaneous and miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs), in ventroposteromedial (VPM-FO) and posteromedial (POm-HO) thalamic nuclei. We show a reduction in frequency of spontaneous IPSCs and mIPSCs in VPM and POm. Together, our results show distinct alterations in the inhibitory control of FO and HO thalamic nuclei in Shank3 KO mice, which could contribute to the deficits in sleep and sensory processing observed in ASD.",

        "abstract": "The human neocortex exhibits characteristic regional patterning (arealization) critical for higher-order cognitive function. Disrupted arealization is strongly implicated in neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs), but current neocortical organoid models largely fail to recapitulate this patterning, limiting mechanistic understanding. Here, we establish a straightforward method for generating arealized organoids through short-term early exposure to anterior (FGF8) or posterior (BMP4/CHIR-99021) morphogens. These treatments created distinct anterior and posterior signaling centers, supporting long-lasting polarization, which we validated with single-cell RNA sequencing that revealed area-specific molecular signatures matching prenatal human cortex. To demonstrate the utility of this platform, we modeled Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) in organoids with distinct anterior and posterior regional identities. FXS organoids showed highly disrupted SOX4/SOX11 expression gradients along the anterior-posterior axis, consistent with alterations found in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and demonstrate how regional patterning defects may contribute to NDD pathology. Together, our study provides a robust platform for generating neocortical organoids with anterior-posterior molecular signatures and highlights the importance of modeling NDDs using experimental platforms with neuroanatomic specificity.",

        "abstract": "Mutations in cyclin-dependent kinase-like 5 (CDKL5) gene trigger a severe neurodevelopmental disorder marked by motor impairment, intellectual disability, autistic-like behaviors, and early-onset epilepsy. Although several Cdkl5-deficient animal models mimic key aspects of the human condition, including hyperactivity and behavioral abnormalities, compromised neuronal architecture and connectivity, and altered activity-dependent synaptic plasticity they fall short of providing a unified understanding of the disorder's cellular and molecular underpinnings. These inconsistencies likely stem from variations in the analyzed brain regions, differences in the ages, sexes and genetic backgrounds of experimental subjects. In this study, we focus on characterizing distinct phenotypes, i.e. activity-dependent synaptic plasticity, hippocampal dendritic spine density, and behavior and provide a longitudinal study of their temporal evolution and sex/genotype-specific patterns. Our findings reveal that in both male and female Cdkl5 deficient mice, disruptions in synaptic plasticity and changes in dendritic spine density develop dynamically in an age-, region- and hemisphere-dependent manner. Collectively, our results expand on previous observations by demonstrating how pathological phenotypes evolve in Cdkl5 mutant mice with age and differ between sexes. Given the absence of a cure and the limited treatment options, our work underscores the urgent need for a deeper understanding of Cdkl5 mutant phenotypes particularly including female subjects.

        "abstract": "Overgrowth intellectual disability syndromes (OGIDs) caused by mutations in the PI3K-AKT-MTOR pathway present significant neurobehavioral challenges. While PTEN Hamartoma Tumor Syndrome (PHTS) has been behaviorally characterized, Smith-Kingsmore Syndrome (SKS) has not, limiting our understanding of shared and unique features across OGIDs. We conducted comprehensive neurobehavioral assessments in 17 individuals with SKS and compared them to previously characterized cohorts with PHTS (n=74), macrocephaly-associated autism (n=33), and healthy controls (n=32). Assessments included standardized measures of motor coordination, adaptive functioning, social interaction, and executive functioning. We performed genotype-phenotype correlation analyses and developed diagnostic classification models using recursive partitioning. Individuals with SKS showed significant impairments across multiple domains compared to controls. Compared to the PTEN-ASD group, SKS individuals demonstrated particularly severe deficits in motor coordination and adaptive functioning, while executive functioning and behavioral regulation were similarly impaired. Novel clinical features were identified, including immune dysregulation and chronic constipation in SKS, and notably high rates of neonatal teeth (44.7%) in PHTS. Diagnostic classification models incorporating both behavioral and medical features achieved above-chance accuracy in distinguishing between conditions, with neonatal teeth emerging as a key distinguishing feature for PHTS. Domain-specific analyses showed variants in the PTEN phosphatase domain were associated with more severe social and executive function deficits compared to C2 domain variants. Correlation analyses between variant pathogenicity scores and clinical measures revealed limited consistent associations, though Combined Annotation Dependent Depletion (CADD) scores showed stable correlations with sensory processing measures across cohorts. Our findings establish distinct neurobehavioral profiles between SKS and PHTS, suggesting different impacts of MTOR versus PTEN mutations on neural circuit development. The identification of novel phenotypic features expands the clinical spectrum of these disorders and provides new diagnostic markers. The limited predictive value of variant pathogenicity scores for neurobehavioral outcomes emphasizes the need for comprehensive individual assessments. These results provide a foundation for developing targeted interventions while highlighting the complexity of genotype-phenotype relationships in PI3K-AKT-MTOR pathway disorders.",

More basic, social cognition is the complicated ability to interact with others. Known to impact everyday functioning and quality of life, deficits in this essential ability have been well documented in schizophrenia, autism spectrum disorders, depression, and other mental health conditions. Studies in other clinical populations also indicate that even subtle deficits in social cognition can impact social everyday functioning. Such social cognitive abilities include emotional face recognition/perception, prosody, theory of mind, and empathy. This review aims to survey our current knowledge on social cognition in people with HIV (PWH), focusing on the following questions: Do people with HIV show impaired social cognition? Is social cognitive impairment of PWH related to neurocognitive impairment? Are social brain regions compromised in PWH? How is social cognition related to social experiences of PWH (e.g., stigma). These questions and more are explored, from which implications for future research are posited.",

        "abstract": "Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is an effective treatment for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). However, CBT does not lead to a satisfying symptom reduction in a considerable number of patients with OCD. The identification of variables that predict insufficient treatment response could improve efficient treatment selection and inform the development of specific augmentative treatments. In the current study, we tested whether prediction of treatment response can be improved by including neurobiological markers during working memory (WM) performance. Forty-four patients with a primary OCD diagnosis participated in an n-back WM task with varying WM load while functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) was performed. Subsequently, all patients received CBT in an outpatient clinic. WM load-dependent modulation of the blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signal in a bilateral cluster in inferior/superior parietal lobule predicted CBT response over and above clinical and sociodemographic variables (p < 0.05). Higher modulation was associated with larger relative symptom reduction. The results of the current study indicate that the ability of the WM system to flexibly adapt to changing task demands might be a useful indicator of CBT response in OCD. Possibly, this mechanism facilitates relearning processes during exposure-based CBT. However, findings need to be replicated in larger samples.",

Previous studies have shown that air pollution increases the risk of mental disorders through various pathways, such as inflammation, oxidative stress, and disruptions in neurotransmitter systems. However, the potential causal relationship between air pollution and mental disorders remains understudied. Understanding the causal relationship between gene prediction of air pollution and mental disorders can provide new insights for improving public health interventions and policies.\nA Mendelian randomization study design was employed. Exposures include PM2.5, PM2.5-10, PM10, NO\nOur analysis uncovered a causal relationship between PM2.5 absorbance and depression (\u03b2\u202f=\u202f0.0361, se\u202f=\u202f0.0166; p\u202f=\u202f0.0298). This finding was further validated with Firth correction and SPA correction. There is no causal link between other air pollutants and depression. Moreover, no evidence supports a link between air pollution and other mental disorders. Sensitivity analysis suggests the robustness of the results.\nMendelian randomization studies provide weak evidence for a causal relationship between PM2.5 absorbance and depression. This result should be interpreted with caution. Further research is needed to corroborate the complex relationship between air pollution and mental disorders.",

        "abstract": "Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a chronic condition where many patients remain symptomatic despite first-line treatments such as Cognitive Behavioural Therapy and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. This randomised controlled trial evaluated Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) efficacy as an augmentation strategy and its impact on brain functional connectivity.\nSixty-eight participants with moderately symptomatic OCD were randomised into MBCT or Treatment as Usual (TAU). Clinical outcomes were evaluated using the Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS) and the Obsessive-Compulsive Inventory, alongside other relevant secondary outcomes. Data were analysed using repeated measures ANOVA to assess time * group effects. Neuroimaging functional measures (resting-state network-connectivity), were collected before and after the intervention and analysed using independent component analysis.\nPrimary outcome: MBCT significantly reduced OCD symptoms compared to TAU (31.73% vs. 8.07% Y-BOCS reduction).\nMBCT group also experienced reductions in depressive symptoms, rumination, perceived stress and quality of life. No significant post-treatment changes were observed in resting-state connectivity. However, baseline connectivity demonstrated significant predictive value, with lower connectivity in pre-selected networks of interest, including the fronto-striatal, salience, and default-mode networks, associated with greater reductions in Y-BOCS scores.\nMBCT is an effective strategy for individuals with moderately symptomatic OCD who continue to experience symptoms despite prior gold-standard treatments. While no post-treatment changes in brain functional connectivity were observed, baseline connectivity patterns predicted symptom reduction, suggesting a neural basis for MBCT response.

        "abstract": "Serotonin syndrome can be challenging to diagnose due to its variable clinical presentation and multiple potential drug triggers. This may present from mild to fatal, with symptoms such as autonomic instability, altered mental status, and neuromuscular excitation often manifesting as hyperreflexia and clonus. We present a 20-year-old man with a past medical history of obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) being treated with clomipramine 25 mg orally (PO) daily and quetiapine 100 mg PO daily, who arrived at the emergency department for agitation. He was found to be in sinus tachycardia with a heart rate (HR) around 140 beats per minute (bpm), with no medical or substance cause identified. He was medically stabilized, continued on his home medications, and transferred to the inpatient psychiatry unit. However, he again became tachycardic at 175 bpm, with muscle rigidity, tremor, agitation, and diaphoresis. The patient's HR stabilized following administration of lorazepam 2 mg intramuscular (IM) and metoprolol 5 mg intravenous (IV), but he remained rigid and diaphoretic for several more hours. The patient reported that he had taken clomipramine in excess prior to admission, so clomipramine was discontinued prior to discharge. In this case, muscle rigidity masked the hyperreflexia and myoclonus often used to diagnose serotonin syndrome, making it even more difficult to recognize. Additionally, collateral information about the patient's excessive use of clomipramine, a potent serotonergic tricyclic antidepressant (TCA), was not obtained early on. Few cases of mild and masked serotonin syndrome have been reported\u00a0due to the difficulty in recognizing and quickly treating such cases. Cases of serotonin syndrome should continue to be reported in order to familiarize clinicians with the varied presentation.",

        "abstract": "Existing data suggest that the duration of untreated illness (DUI) for OCD patients is notably prolonged. Only few studies have investigated whether clinical phenotypes differ in terms of latency to treatment. This study aims to investigate clinical characteristics associated with shorter or longer DUI in OCD patients.\nA sample of 316 patients with OCD were consecutively recruited from two OCD Tertiary Clinics in Italy. \u200b\u200bSociodemographic and clinical variables were compared between two subgroups based on DUI: Short DUI (sDUI: <4 years) and Long DUI (lDUI: \u22654 years). In addition, multivariable models were performed to examine the independent association of stressful events at onset and sociodemographic factors with DUI.\nThe sDUI subgroup showed significantly higher rates of stress events at onset (40.8 % vs. 20.8 %, p<.05). Logistic regression confirmed that stressful events were independently associated with a lower likelihood of long DUI (OR = 0.41, 95 % CI 0.20-0.84, p = .016). Higher rates were observed in association with lDUI for obsessions of contamination (47.3 % vs. 29.8 %, p<.005), symmetry (27.4 % vs. 11.9 %, p<.001), somatic (20.5 % vs. 11.9 %, p<.05), and multiple obsessions (42.5 % vs 20.2 %, p<.005). Among the compulsion phenotypes, lDUI patients showed higher rates of compulsive cleaning (52.1 % vs. 35.7 %; p<.005), counting (13.7 % vs. 4.2 %, p<.005), hoarding (11.6 % vs. 5.3 %, p<.05), ordering (28.8 % vs. 15.5 %, p<.005), and repeating rituals (28.1 % vs. 15.5 %, p<.005).\nPresent findings highlight a significant association between DUI and specific clinical phenotypes in OCD patients. Higher rates of stress events at onset in patients with sDUI suggest that stress events may trigger earlier treatment seeking. These insights underscore the importance of early identification to reduce DUI, potentially improving long-term outcomes.",

        "abstract": "There is an ongoing debate regarding the role of impulsivity in obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Impulsivity is a complex multidimensional construct, generally defined as the tendency to act without forethought. OCD, in contrast, is associated with preoccupation with the consequences of one's actions, harm and risk avoidance, and was posited to lie on the opposite end of a proposed impulsive-compulsive continuum. The aim of the present study was to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies comparing OCD and non-clinical controls on self-report measures of impulsivity.\nTwenty-seven studies were subjected to analyses (N\nResults from the meta-analyses showed large effect sizes for the BIS attention subscale (g\u202f=\u202f0.83; 95\u202f% CI\u202f=\u202f0.61-1.06), medium effect size for the nonplanning subscale (g\u202f=\u202f0.41; 95\u202f% CI\u202f=\u202f0.29-0.53), and very small effect sizes for the motor subscale (g\u202f=\u202f0.17; 95\u202f% CI\u202f=\u202f0.02-0.32). These results were complemented by a systematic review, where most studies found significantly elevated attention impulsivity in OCD compared to controls, whereas only a minority of studies reported significantly elevated motor impulsivity CONCLUSION: OCD is not associated with elevated trait-level impulsivity. Inflated total BIS scores frequently result from high Attentional Impulsivity scores on this measure. In addition, individuals with OCD tend to inflate self-reported impulsivity. A pathway toward resolution of the controversy surrounding impulsivity in OCD would be to differentiate between trait versus state impulsivity.",

These findings highlight the urgent need for inclusive, equitable and specialised mental healthcare policies.",

        "abstract": "Structural brain deficits associated with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), panic disorder (PD), and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) have been documented, but their integration within a unified framework remains unexplored. This study investigates, in anxiety and anxiety-related disorders, whether they share neurophysiological bases, whether structural changes (SCs) are linked to common genes, whether shared SCs co-occur with similar functional brain impairments, and whether brain morphometry can serve as biomarkers for diagnosis and treatment prediction.\nParticipants included 100 individuals with GAD, 58 with PD, 45 with OCD, and 85 healthy controls, all drug-free. Structural and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging scans and clinical assessments were conducted before and after 4\u00a0weeks of paroxetine monotherapy. Analyses included voxel-based and surface-based morphometry; functional connectivity (FC) and Granger causality analysis (GCA) with shared SCs as regions of interest; associations between clinical assessments and neuroimaging metrics; associations between gene expression profiles and SCs; and machine learning.\nCingulate atrophy (CA) emerged as a common SC, with disorder-specific atrophy in gray matter volume (GMV) and cortical surface. Transcriptome-neuroimaging correlations identified shared genetic associations with GMV alterations, with negatively correlated genes enriched in neurodevelopment and cellular growth regulation (ND-CGR). Cingulate GMV was positively correlated with cognitive performance in GAD and PD patients. FC and GCA showed CA disrupted networks governing emotional regulation and cognitive control, characterized by overactive top-down influence and reduced bottom-up feedback. Machine learning demonstrated strong performance in classification and treatment response prediction, with cingulate morphometry contributing significantly.\nCA is a shared neural substrate in GAD, PD, and OCD, linked to genetic disruptions in ND-CGR, cognitive impairments, and functional brain deficits. Cingulate morphometry holds promise as a biomarker for diagnosis and treatment response in these conditions.",

Studies focusing on metacognitive efficiency have demonstrated disrupted precision of confidence estimates in OCD. However, the data of those studies may have been contaminated by the overestimation of metacognitive efficiency resulting from the use of the staircase method. We used a two-alternative forced-choice task in which difficulty was held constant within each block but varied across blocks throughout the task. No feedback was given to the participants. We collected data from 161 healthy university students with varying degrees of tendencies of OCD symptoms. Contrary to the previous literature, participants with a higher obsessive-compulsive tendency had higher metacognitive efficiency. Applying the drift-diffusion modeling approach to the first-order decisions of participants revealed that participants with a higher obsessive-compulsive tendency had lower efficiency in integrating perceptual information and less cautious thresholds. Finally, we investigated post-error slowing and found that participants with a higher obsessive-compulsive tendency exhibited limited adaptation of responses to errors and low confidence levels. Overall, our results suggest that having a higher obsessive-compulsive tendency is associated with sufficient metacognitive capacity but also with limited utilization of the metacognitive information for behavioral adaptation.",

The significance of the microbiota-gut-brain axis has been increasingly documented in the manifestation of neuropsychiatric disorders. Herein, we investigated the impact of synbiotic containing Faecalibacterium prausnitzii ATCC 27,766 (F. prausnitzii) and prebiotics [fructooligosaccharides (FOS) and galactooligosaccharides (GOS)] on quinpirole-induced OCD-like symptoms in rats. Repeated quinpirole injections led to compulsive- and anxiety-like behaviors, as rats showed reduced head-dipping behavior in the hole board test, increased marble burying and self-grooming behaviors, and decreased exploration of open areas during elevated plus maze testing. Treatment with Faecalibacterium prausnitzii combined with prebiotics (FOS and GOS) over a six-week period improved these behavioral alterations, reducing signs of repetitive, compulsive, and anxiety-related behaviors. Notably, neither open-field locomotion nor body weight showed significant differences between the experimental groups. In molecular studies, synbiotic treatment showed a reversal of elevated levels/mRNA expression of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 in the frontal cortex and increased mRNA expression of tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH-1) in the colon of quinpirole-injected rats. The cohorts of rats received synbiotic treatment showed normalization of intestinal parameters, including fecal short-chain fatty acid concentrations (acetate, propionate, and butyrate), as well as improvements in intestinal morphology markers such as villi-crypt ratios, goblet cell populations, occludin and TPH1 expression in the colon. These findings highlight the potential benefits of synbiotic laden with F. prausnitzii and prebiotics (FOS\u2009+\u2009GOS) in alleviating quinpirole-induced OCD-like symptoms by reshaping animal gut-brain-axis mediators.",

This study aimed to compare impulsivity, metacognitions, and clinical characteristics across BFRBDs. Ninety adolescents (aged 10-18 years) with BFRBDs and 40 healthy controls (HC) completed the Revised Children's Anxiety and Depression Scale-Child Version (RCADS-CV), the Metacognitions Questionnaire for Children and Adolescents (MCQ-CA), the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale-Brief (BIS-Brief), and the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL). Symptom severity was assessed using disorder-specific measures. There were no significant age differences between the BFRBDs and HC groups. However, within the BFRBDs subgroups, adolescents with TTM and SPD were significantly older than those with NB (p\u2009=\u2009.028). Notably, despite being younger, the NB group exhibited the longest duration of BFRBDs symptoms (p\u2009<\u2009.001). The TTM group showed higher MCQ-CA total, positive beliefs about worry, and cognitive monitoring. In contrast, the SPD group had higher poor self-regulation scores (all p\u2009<\u2009.05). Symptom severity across BFRBDs was negatively associated with PedsQL total scores and positively associated with MCQ-CA total and RCADS-CV total scores (all p\u2009<\u2009.05). These findings suggest that while metacognitions are more prominent in TTM, impulsivity plays a greater role in SPD. Understanding the distinct contributions of impulsivity and metacognitions in BFRBDs may facilitate the development of targeted treatment approaches tailored to each behavior.",

        "abstract": "Adverse events (AEs), such as natural disasters, community violence and public health crises, impact global health and are associated with fear, anxiety and disorientation. AEs are related to both short-term and long-term mental health problems in children and adolescents. Particularly, research has shown a significantly higher prevalence of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) in individuals with a history of trauma. This work aims to explore the obsessive-compulsive (OC) trajectories following an AE, considering the role played by individual vulnerability, anxiety and psychological consequences for children and adolescents. In this direction, Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has represented an ideal and unique AE of concomitant factors that can help to understand the obsessive trajectory. Our framework shows that intrusive flashbacks, following a traumatic experience, can turn into automatic intrusive thoughts that become persistent and emotionally intense, similar to obsessive reactions. Intrusive thoughts can evolve into obsessive patterns, leading to compulsive behaviors aimed at reducing discomfort. The nature of the traumatic event may influence the development of specific OC symptoms. Risk factors include individual vulnerability, such as developmental stage and emotional reactivity, which can exacerbate obsessive stress responses. Anxiety plays a key role, as increased stress can stimulate automatic intrusive thoughts and amplify OCD reactions, especially in younger individuals. Disruptions in daily life can further increase anxiety and maladaptive behaviors in children and adolescents, affecting psychological well-being. The psychological effects of AEs can continue well beyond the events themselves. It is necessary to monitor and support young people involved to prevent their development. Community and individual resources are essential to promote resilience following such events.",

This study aimed to investigate the characteristics of Electroencephalography (EEG) microstates in patients with OCD while they performed executive-function tasks.\nEighty-five patients with OCD and 86 healthy controls (HC) completed the Task-Switching Paradigm, Stop-Signal Task, and N-back task, which assess shifting, inhibition, and working memory updating functions, respectively. EEG data were recorded and analyzed utilizing microstate and standardized low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography (sLORETA) methods.\nPatients with OCD exhibited impairments across all three executive function tasks. EEG microstate analysis revealed abnormal neural dynamics in the OCD group. Specifically, OCD patients showed a shorter duration of a frontal-parietal executive microstate and prolonged dominance of a precuneus-related microstate, reflecting altered large-scale network activity. Source localization further indicated decreased activation in parietal lobes and increased precuneus activation in OCD during shifting, overactivation of occipital-parietal regions but reduced frontal engagement during response inhibition, and reduced frontal-parietal activation during working memory updating.\nOCD is associated with broad disruptions in executive functions, accompanied by aberrant spatiotemporal brain dynamics. Our findings indicate that patients' difficulties in shifting, inhibition, and updating are tightly linked to abnormal EEG microstate patterns and altered regional brain activations, highlighting the utility of high-temporal-resolution EEG measures in probing the neural mechanisms of OCD.",

        "doi": "10.2196/80801",
        "abstract": "Trauma exposure is highly prevalent and associated with various health issues. However, health care professionals can exhibit trauma-related diagnostic overshadowing bias, leading to misdiagnosis and inadequate treatment of trauma-exposed populations. Generative artificial intelligence (GAI) models are increasingly used in health care contexts. No research has examined whether GAI demonstrates this bias in decision-making and how rates of this bias may compare to mental health professionals (MHPs).\nThis study aimed to assess trauma-related diagnostic overshadowing among frontier GAI models and compare evidence of trauma-related diagnostic overshadowing between frontier GAI models and MHPs.\nMHPs (N=232; mean [SD] age 43.7 [15.95] years) completed an experimental paradigm consisting of 2 vignettes describing adults presenting with obsessive-compulsive symptoms or substance abuse symptoms. One vignette included a trauma exposure history (ie, sexual trauma or physical trauma), and one vignette did not include a trauma exposure history. Participants answered questions about their preferences for diagnosis and treatment options for clients within the vignettes. GAI models (eg, Gemini 1.5 Flash, ChatGPT-4o mini, Claude Sonnet, and Meta Llama 3) completed the same experimental paradigm, with each block being reviewed by each GAI model 20 times. Mann-Whitney U tests and chi-square analyses were used to assess diagnostic and treatment decision-making across vignette factors and respondents.\nGAI models, similar to MHPs, demonstrated some evidence of trauma-related diagnostic overshadowing bias, particularly in Likert-based ratings of posttraumatic stress disorder diagnosis and treatment when sexual trauma was present (P<.001). However, GAI models generally exhibited significantly less bias than MHPs across both Likert and forced-choice clinical decision tasks. Compared to MHPs, GAI models assigned higher ratings for the target diagnosis and treatment in obsessive-compulsive disorder vignettes (rb=0.43-0.63; P<.001) and for the target treatment in substance use disorder vignettes (rb=0.57; P<.001) when trauma was present. In forced-choice tasks, GAI models were significantly more accurate than MHPs in selecting the correct diagnosis and treatment for obsessive-compulsive disorder vignettes (\u03c7\u00b21=48.84-61.07; P<.001) and for substance use disorder vignettes involving sexual trauma (\u03c7\u00b21=15.17-101.61; P<.001).\nGAI models demonstrate some evidence of trauma-related diagnostic overshadowing bias, yet the degree of bias varied by task and model. Moreover, GAI models generally demonstrated less bias than MHPs in this experimental paradigm. These findings highlight the importance of understanding GAI biases in mental health care. More research into bias reduction strategies and responsible implementation of GAI models in mental health care is needed.",

        "abstract": "Off-label psychopharmacologic medication use is widespread in child and adolescent psychiatry, but little is known about its associated factors. This study aimed to assess frequency and determinants of off-label use of antidepressants and antipsychotics in youths in daily clinical practice.\nIn a prospective clinical study ('TDM-VIGIL') at 18 centers in three German-speaking countries, child psychiatric patients aged 4-18 years undergoing routine treatment with antidepressants and antipsychotics were systematically followed. Demographic, clinical and pharmacological data were collected in an online-based patient registry; off-label use was categorized by reasons, including age, indication or duration of treatment for each treatment episode. Examined correlates of off-label use included sex, treatment setting, diagnosis and illness severity.\nAbout 67% of all antidepressant and antipsychotic treatment episodes in the 700 included patients (mean age\u2009=\u200914.6 years, girls\u2009=\u200967%) were off-label. For antidepressants, 55.2% were off-label (age\u2009=\u200951.1%, non-licensed indications\u2009=\u200937.4%, age\u2009+\u2009indication\u2009=\u200911.5%), for antipsychotics 81.7% were off-label (age\u2009=\u200929.4%, non-licensed indications\u2009=\u200933.2%, age\u2009+\u2009indication\u2009=\u200937.4%). Sex, age (<\u200912, \u2265\u200912 years) as well as illness severity were not associated with off-label use. In antidepressant treatment, 'depression' and 'obsessive compulsive disorder' diagnoses were associated with reduced and 'suicidality at admission' with increased off-label prescriptions. In antipsychotics, 'schizophrenia diagnoses' was linked to decreased, university hospital treatment to increased off-label use.\nThe frequency of off-label use of antidepressants and even more of antipsychotics in youths treated at specialized child psychiatric centers is high. As the clinical efficacy and safety of off-label antidepressant and antipsychotic use in youth is under-researched, our results call for further pharmacovigilance studies and strategies to improve drug safety.",

        "abstract": "Assessing patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) for surgery is challenging due to their complex psychiatric histories, extensive and often fragmented treatment records, wide geographic spread, and lack of awareness among patients and providers about surgical options. We analyze the presurgical evaluation pipeline of our practice to identify crucial aspects of an efficient multidisciplinary surgical OCD service.\nWe conducted a cross-sectional study of all patients evaluated for surgical treatment of OCD by our clinic from January 2018 to December 2023. We retrospectively reviewed internal clinic records to track each patient's progress through our presurgical evaluation pipeline, from initial contact to surgical treatment, and identified the primary causes of attrition. In addition, we analyzed the insurance approval history and geographic spread of patients who underwent surgical treatment to assess the impact of these factors as potential barriers to surgical care.\nFrom 2018 to 2023, we evaluated 102 patients (81% self-referred; 19% provider-referred). Of these 102 patients, we evaluated 65 at virtual visits, 41 at on-site visits, and ultimately treated 31 patients with surgery (23, deep brain stimulation [DBS]; 8, laser interstitial thermal therapy [LITT] capsulotomy). Forty-three percent of patients offered surgery were initially denied insurance coverage, which did not differ by type of surgery received (DBS vs LITT; P = .67). Patients traveled a mean distance (\u00b1SD) of 730 \u00b1 540 miles to our clinic for surgical care and follow-up, a distance significantly greater for LITT patients (1100 \u00b1 540 miles) than that for DBS patients (590 \u00b1 470 miles, P = .012).\nScreening mechanisms are essential for efficiently evaluating patients with OCD for surgical management. We also found low provider referral rates, high insurance denial rates, and long travel distances to be principal barriers patients with OCD face in accessing surgical therapy.",

        "abstract": "Internalizing disorders (INTs), including anxiety (AD) and depressive disorders (DD), frequently emerge during adolescence. Studies suggest that certain core domains of executive functioning (EF), i.e. inhibition, shifting and working memory (WM) may show selectively lower performance in certain INTs. This systematic review aimed to evaluate the evidence of associations between INTs and EF in adolescents. A systematic search was conducted in Medline, Psych-INFO, Scopus, and Web of Science in May 2023. Inclusion focused on adolescents (12-17) with AD (including obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)) or DD. After screening 2,551 titles/abstracts, 818 records underwent full-text review, on which independent reviewers reached 93% agreement on eligibility. EF parameters, measured through task-performance or ratings, were extracted from 32 eligible articles published since 2014. Performance-based EF differences were reported in 22 studies, most frequently in adolescents with DD. Task-based inhibition showed lower scores most consistently in DD (n\u2009=\u20095). Findings were mixed across other INTs. Three studies found evidence for improved inhibition performance in OCD (n\u2009=\u20092) and AD (n\u2009=\u20091). Finally, 6 studies reporting on self- or parent-rated EF found significant difficulties across EF domains, of which 3 contrasted with intact performances on task-based measurements of EF. Findings suggest both objective and subjective EF difficulties across INTs with no conclusive evidence for selective domain-specific differences. We highlight a discrepancy between subjectively experienced or observed deficits in daily EF and performance on structured tasks. This suggests that rating-based EF may be more sensitive for capturing subtle EF difficulties and therefore adds value in research and clinical settings. Finally, the quality of studies is discussed and directions for future studies are identified, namely, the use of both task and rating-based measures of EF as well as inclusion of larger sample sizes.",

This narrative review explores the clinical and neurobiological overlaps between CSBD and selected mental disorders, including mood and anxiety disorders, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, autism spectrum disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and specific personality disorders. The review emphasizes shared mechanisms, such as dysregulation of the dopaminergic reward system, impairments in emotional regulation, and altered connectivity in brain regions responsible for impulse control and affect processing. Structural and functional neural changes associated with impulsivity, such as abnormalities in the prefrontal cortex, orbitofrontal cortex, and limbic system, are discussed as potential contributors to both CSBD and its comorbid conditions. These findings support a dimensional approach to diagnosis and treatment, highlighting the need for integrated clinical strategies that account for overlapping symptoms and underlying vulnerabilities.",

This study was the first to use network analysis to examine how OCD symptom networks change with EX/RP and vary across different progress trajectories.\nData from four clinical trials with 334 adults with OCD who received manualized EX/RP were pooled. The Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS) was administered at baseline, midpoint, and post-treatment. OCD symptom networks were constructed using individual Y-BOCS items at these three time points, both for the entire sample and for three different progress trajectories (dramatic, moderate, and little-to-no progress) previously identified using growth mixture modeling. Network measures, including global efficiency, modularity, and weighted degree centrality, were computed to quantitatively assess network properties across treatment.\nNetwork analysis revealed two distinct modules at baseline: resistance/control and interference/distress. In the full sample, these two modules became integrated over time, as indicated by significant increases in global efficiency and weighted degree centrality and decreases in modularity; at post-treatment, the network shifted toward a fully connected network, and the strength of associations between nodes increased. These changes were most pronounced in the dramatic progress class.\nOur findings indicated that effective EX/RP treatment was associated with more integrated OCD symptom networks, which may serve as an indicator of treatment response. Future research should examine how these shifts in network connectivity correspond to changes in underlying brain circuitry and/or to early identification of treatment responders.",

        "abstract": "Background and objective Osteochondral defects (OCD) of the talus are associated with pain and ankle joint dysfunction. Autologous matrix-induced chondrogenesis (AMIC) is one of the arthroscopic surgical techniques described for the treatment of talar OCD. There is scarce evidence regarding the use of Chondro-Gide or any other synthetic matrix for OCD of the talus. We aimed to investigate patient outcomes following Chongro-Gide repair of talar OCDs, along with the relationship\u00a0between lesion diameter and patient outcomes. Methods A retrospective cross-sectional study was carried out, and patient outcomes were recorded. Olerud-Molander Ankle Score (OMAS) was documented for each patient during clinic follow-ups, as well as visual analogue scores (VAS). Both preoperative and postoperative OMAS and VAS scores were recorded at the 12-week postoperative follow-up. The other factors recorded were as follows: lesion size, site of OCD, postoperative complications, patient age, and gender. Results Sixteen patients were identified with isolated talus OCD. The mean preoperative OMFAS\u00a0was 30 (range: 10-45)\u00a0while the postoperative OMAS\u00a0was 72.7 (range: 65-100, p<0.01). The mean VAS score was 7.85 preoperatively compared to 2.69 postoperatively (p<0.01). The average OCD diameter was 8.9 mm (range: 3-14). There was no statistically significant correlation between OCD lesion diameter and improvement in OMAS scores (p>0.05). The most commonly reported complication by patients was postoperative stiffness. Conclusions We observed positive outcomes following arthroscopic osteochondral lesion repair using AMIC Chondro-Gide. While there is a paucity of evidence on the use of AMIC to treat talar OCDs, our study adds to the growing evidence endorsing arthroscopic AMIC with Chondro for treating talar OCDs.",

During rehabilitation, a secondary trochlear lesion developed and was treated with a combination of micro-fragmented autologous adipose tissue (mFAT) and a collagen membrane. The patient showed significant improvements in functional scores (IKDC, KOOS, Kujala, Lysholm), MRI-confirmed cartilage regeneration, and returned to sports-specific training. These findings highlight the potential of regenerative techniques for cartilage repair in young athletes. Further research is needed to validate these results in larger cohorts with extended follow-ups.",

This systematic review examines OCS prevalence, clinical characteristics, neurobiological correlates, and treatment approaches in FEP populations.\nFollowing PRISMA guidelines, we searched PubMed, Embase, PsycINFO, Web of Science, and Cochrane databases from inception to May 2025. Studies examining OCS in FEP patients (\u22645\u00a0years from first episode) were included. Meta-analysis used random-effects models with Freeman-Tukey transformation. Quality assessment employed Newcastle-Ottawa Scale and Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool.\nTwenty-one studies encompassing 3989 participants were included. Meta-analysis revealed clinically significant OCS in 26.8\u00a0% (95\u00a0% CI: 18.2-37.1\u00a0%) of FEP patients and formal OCD diagnosis in 8.3\u00a0% (95\u00a0% CI: 6.1-11.2\u00a0%)-representing 3-4 fold elevations versus general population. OCS typically emerged 8-12\u00a0months before psychotic symptoms in 65\u00a0% of patients. Comorbid OCS patients demonstrated significantly higher positive symptom severity, depression scores, and functional impairment. Neuroimaging identified frontostriatothalamic abnormalities, including reduced orbitofrontal (Cohen's d: 0.48) and anterior cingulate cortex volume (Cohen's d: 0.43). Social cognitive deficits, particularly theory of mind impairments (58.3\u00a0% vs 71.2\u00a0% accuracy, p\u00a0=\u00a00.024), were enhanced in OCS patients. Treatment challenges included antipsychotic-induced OCS (38.9\u00a0% with clozapine vs 20.1\u00a0% olanzapine) and SSRI-related psychotic symptom exacerbation (16.7\u00a0%).\nOCS affect one in four FEP patients, supporting a distinct \"schizo-obsessive\" subtype with specific neurobiological abnormalities and treatment considerations. Routine screening and integrated management protocols are essential for optimizing outcomes.",

        "doi": "10.1002/eat.24571",
        "abstract": "Anxiety about weight gain is a central feature of eating disorders (EDs) and plays a key role in maintaining ED symptomatology. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) experts have observed that patients with EDs often believe regular eating will lead to immediate, dramatic, and/or uncontrollable weight gain, prompting interventions like \"collaborative weighing\" and \"open weighing\" that help patients develop a realistic understanding of eating-weight relationships. However, patients also report anxiety about the consequences of weight gain (e.g., social rejection, self-hatred, permanent body dissatisfaction). While various CBT interventions address concerns about the consequences of weight gain, we propose that open weighing sessions-when patients confront weight increases and process accompanying emotional responses-provide underutilized therapeutic opportunities to work with these beliefs in real-time.\nThis paper outlines three clinical enhancements that systematically leverage open weighing sessions to address consequence-related beliefs: (1) identifying catastrophic beliefs about weight gain consequences through guided inquiry, (2) integrating cognitive restructuring by framing weight restoration as a behavioral experiment, and (3) combining in\u00a0vivo weighing with imaginal exposure to feared weight gain consequences.\nThese enhancements may provide complementary techniques for capitalizing on patients' real-time emotional activation during weighing, potentially enhancing existing CBT protocols' effectiveness in addressing a key mechanism underlying restrictive EDs.\nFuture research might include randomized controlled trials comparing various weighing approaches, mixed-methods evaluations exploring weight-related fears across ED diagnoses and weight status, and mechanistic studies examining how addressing consequence-related beliefs improves treatment outcomes.",

        "abstract": "The quest to develop and improve neuromodulatory therapies for treatment-resistant psychiatric disorders has been fueled by the discovery of intracranial neural biomarkers of symptom dimensions. These neural correlates shed light on the underlying neurophysiology of the disorder and may even be useful in guiding therapy delivery. This systematic review summarizes recent efforts in this field relating neural activity to behavior and symptomatology. For years, the majority of these neurobehavioral relationships had been studied in the hospital or clinic environment. Recent technological advances in implanted neuromodulation devices that permit not only stimulation, but also intracranial neural recording have enabled this research to move into natural settings, recording for longer periods of time in the real world. We review this combined literature to identify neurobehavioral relationships that show commonalities across these different recording strategies and environments. We also discuss potential ways to use this information for guiding neuromodulation therapy. The success of \"closed loop\" stimulation strategies for movement disorders and epilepsy has led to interest in exploring similar approaches for psychiatric disorders. Such efforts, however, need to consider the disorder-specific time constant relating changes in a neural biomarker to changes in symptoms and behavior. This relationship likely differs between Parkinson's disease and depression, OCD, or addiction. We interpret the results of our systematic review in this light to offer suggestions for future closed-loop or \"clinician in the loop\" implementations to inform the next generation of neuromodulatory therapies.",

        "abstract": "Genetic ancestry is an important factor to account for in DNA methylation studies because genetic variation influences DNA methylation patterns. One approach uses principal components (PCs) calculated from CpG sites that overlap with common SNPs to adjust for ancestry when genotyping data is not available. However, this method does not remove technical and biological variations, such as sex and age, prior to calculating the PCs. The first PC is therefore often associated with factors other than ancestry.\nWe developed and adapted the adapted EpiAnceR+\u2009approach, which includes (1) residualizing the CpG data overlapping with common SNPs for control probe PCs, sex, age, and cell type proportions to remove the effects of technical and biological factors, and (2) integrating the residualized data with genotype calls from the SNP probes (commonly referred to as rs probes) present on the arrays, before calculating PCs and evaluated the clustering ability and relationship to genetic ancestry.\nThe PCs generated by EpiAnceR+\u2009led to improved clustering for repeated samples from the same individual and stronger associations with genetic ancestry groups predicted from genotype information compared to the original approach. EpiAnceR+\u2009also outperformed the use of DNA methylation PCs or surrogate variables for ancestry adjustment.\nWe show that the EpiAnceR+\u2009approach improves the adjustment for genetic ancestry in DNA methylation studies. EpiAnceR+\u2009can be integrated into existing R pipelines for commercial methylation arrays, such as 450\u00a0K, EPIC v1, and EPIC v2.

Methamphetamine use disorder (MUD) and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) exhibit overlapping compulsive features, however, similarities or differences in whole-brain dynamics on subsecond timescales between patients with MUD and OCD remain unclear.\nWe recruited 127 subjects aged 16 to 55\u00a0years, including 45 OCD patients, 44 MUD patients and 39 healthy controls (HCs), and collected resting-state EEG data. The OCD symptoms were assessed using the Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS), and drug craving in MUD was evaluated with the Drug Desire Questionnaire (DDQ).\nCompared to HCs, MUD patients showed reduced time coverage of microstate A. OCD patients exhibited lower time coverage and occurrence of microstate A than MUD patients, alongside altered transition probabilities (reduced B/C/D\u00a0\u2192\u00a0A; increased B\u00a0\u2192\u00a0D) (all p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). In OCD, compulsion subscale scores were negatively correlated with B\u00a0\u2192\u00a0D transition probability and the mean duration of microstate D, but positively correlated with the occurrence of microstate C (all p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). For MUD, DDQ desire and intention scores were positively correlated with the occurrence and time coverage of microstate D (all p\u00a0<\u00a00.05).\nOur findings reveal that distinct EEG microstate patterns in MUD and OCD, shedding light on the underlying neurodynamic and connectivity differences between the two disorders.

Behavioral tests assessed anxiety-like behavior, social interaction, and spatial memory. Immunohistochemical and gene expression analyses were performed on the prefrontal cortex (PFC) to evaluate microglial activation and neuroinflammation. TRP-kynurenine (KYN) pathway activity was measured in both PFC and peripheral circulation, along with intestinal TRP metabolism. Gut microbial composition was analyzed through diversity metrics and specific taxa identification.\nPrenatal Poly I:C exposure induced anxiety-like behavior, impaired social interaction, and spatial memory deficits in offspring. The PFC showed sustained microglial activation and chronic neuroinflammation. TRP-KYN pathway activation was observed in both central and peripheral systems, accompanied by significant disruptions in intestinal TRP metabolism. Gut microbial analysis revealed reduced diversity and specific alterations in TRP-related taxa (Ruminococcus gauvreauii_group and Candidatus Saccharimonas). These microbial changes correlated with both intestinal TRP metabolic levels and behavioral abnormalities.\nOur findings demonstrate that aberrant TRP metabolism associated with gut microbiota dysbiosis contributes to neuroinflammation and behavioral deficits in offspring following prenatal immune activation, highlighting the gut-microbiota-TRP axis as a key mechanism in neurodevelopmental impairments.",

        "abstract": "Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a complex neurodevelopmental condition for which there are no definitive medications targeting core symptoms. Growing evidence indicates that individuals with ASD exhibit immune dysfunction and evidence of peripheral and central inflammation. Immunotherapy interventions have shown promise in addressing this dysregulation. Notably, low-dose Interleukin-2 (Ld IL-2), an established treatment for certain autoimmune diseases, represents a potential therapeutic approach. Our study aims to investigate the association between Ld IL-2-induced immune modulation and behavioral improvements in children with ASD. This research may offer novel insights into potential treatment strategies for ASD.\nIn our previously completed single-arm, self-controlled clinical study (data unpublished), 24 ASD children with immune abnormalities received Ld IL-2 treatment, all of whom showed varying degrees of symptom improvement. This paper presents case reports of four ASD children who demonstrated marked clinical improvement and substantial correction of immune imbalance following treatment. The average age of 4 participants was approximately 6 years old, comprising two boys and two girls. Assessments using the Childhood Autism Rating Scale(CARS), Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABC), Autism Treatment Evaluation Checklist (ATEC), Krug's Autism Behavior Scale (CABS), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), and Caregiver Strain Questionnaire (CGSQ)revealed substantial behavioral improvements and no adverse events. Improvements persisted for three months post-treatment, with notable progress in Speech/Language/Communication and body/health/behavior domains. According to caregivers, there has been a observed improvement in the subjects' sleep quality, accompanied by a gradual restoration of overall physical health. Immune testing in the four pediatric patients revealed a marked decrease in both the proportion of Type 1 cytotoxic T cells (Tc1) and the Tc1/Regulatory T cell ratio.\nOur findings in these four cases describe an association between Ld IL-2 treatment and observed improvements in ASD symptoms, potentially linked to immune modulation.",

        "abstract": "Both screen time (ST) and the development of cortical volume have significant effects on the mental health of children. This study aims to examine the relationship between ST and mental health in preschool children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) while investigating the potential mediating role of cortical volume. The findings may provide evidence to support clinical identification and intervention strategies.\nA retrospective observational analysis was conducted on 149 children with ASD aged 18\u201360 months, who were categorized into two groups based on their daily ST: high-dose exposure (HDE) and low-dose exposure (LDE). The study compared the two groups in terms of demographic characteristics, ASD symptoms, neurodevelopmental level, mental health condition (assessed using the Child Behavior Checklist, CBCL), and cortical volume. Pearson correlation tests were used to determine the direct correlations between ST, cortical volume, and mental health. Multi-step linear regression analysis was used to investigate the mediating effect of cortical volume on the association between ST and mental health conditions.\nChildren in the HDE group showed significantly higher anxiety/depression scores (60.02\u00a0\u00b1 28.76 vs. 50.17\u00a0\u00b1 23.10,\u00a0\nThe findings suggest that ST adversely affects the mental health of children with ASD, with cortical volume in the left superior frontal area potentially serving as a key mediator in this relationship. These findings highlight the need for ST management in early ASD interventions.\nChinese Clinical Trial Registry (ChiCTR): ChiCTR2100051141. Registered on 14 September 2021.

        "abstract": "Adolescence is a sensitive period characterized by significant neurocognitive development, with important implications for learning and decision-making. Working memory and reinforcement learning are essential for decision making and real-life dynamic adaptation to the environment and are often affected in individuals with anxiety and depression. Using a cognitive computational approach, we investigated associations between working memory, reinforcement learning, age, and symptoms of generalized anxiety and depression in 193 adolescents aged 12-24 years. Participants completed the Reinforcement Learning Working Memory (RLWM) task. To gain insight into the dynamics underlying instrumental learning behavior, we employed a computational model that combines the RLWM model with a Linear Ballistic Accumulator (RLWM-LBA), to quantify processes related to working memory and reinforcement learning, as well as choice dynamics underlying reaction times. We observed an age-related increase in task performance, but no differences depending on symptoms. Bayesian regression models revealed strong evidence for an association between age and the start point variability parameter of the LBA module, suggesting reduced choice stochasticity in older adolescents. In line with the behavioral findings, we found anecdotal to moderate evidence for no associations between RLWM-LBA parameters and symptom sum scores. Lastly, we trained regression models testing the utility of RLWM-LBA parameters for predicting age and symptom burden, yielding poor predictive performance. This study highlights differences in choice dynamics underlying age-related improvements in instrumental learning, while finding that cognitive differences identified in case-control studies did not generalize to symptom variation in this sample from the general adolescent population.",

        "abstract": "The Bayley Scales of Infant Development is used in many studies and clinical trials in children with developmental disabilities, including children with Angelman syndrome (AS).\nWe assessed 142 children with AS in an international multicentre study with the Bayley Scales of Infant Development III, of which 52 children were tested more than once. We assessed criterion validity using proportion analysis, scalability using Mokken analyses and stability of scoring by counting pass-to-fail and fail-to-pass items.\nResults revealed good scalability in all scales but the expressive language scale, indicating that the items of these scales measured one underlying trait. In the expressive language scale, the AS-related speech difficulties invalidated scoring. Scoring within children across assessments was unstable for all scales except the gross motor scale, as more than half of the children made one or more errors in previously correct items. Loss or regression of skills does not fully explain this finding. Alternative explanations including motivation, concentration, on-task behaviour and anxiety should also be considered when scores decline.\nThis study shows that caution should be taken when interpreting single and successive scores of children with AS on the Bayley-III and that other forms of assessment should complement assessment in children with AS.",

        "abstract": "Suicidal thoughts and behaviors (STB) are alarmingly prevalent in youth, with even higher rates among children diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (hereafter autism) - a neurodevelopmental difference characterized by differences in social communication skills and restrictive and repetitive behaviors. Although autistic youth are hospitalized in psychiatric units at higher rates than their non-autistic peers, the limited research exploring hospital staffs' experience with autistic patients and their families highlights a disconnect between providers and parents and a lack of knowledge about autism. The current study leveraged medical records of 86 hospitalized patients (43 autistic, 43 non-autistic) aged 6-18, extracting quantitative and qualitative data to explore differences in demographic characteristics, co-occurring diagnoses, and reasons and stressors related to hospitalization for suicide-related crises, as well as hospital staff's perceptions of autistic patients. Results indicated that autistic patients had more co-occurring diagnoses than non-autistic, with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder being the most common in autistic patients and anxiety and depression common in both autistic and non-autistic patents. Autistic patients' hospitalization was often related to aggression and stressors involving interpersonal skills. Behaviors related to rigidity were documented by hospital staff working with autistic psychiatric patients. Differences in factors related to hospitalization for suicide-related crises in autistic and non-autistic youth underscore the need for research on suicide risk factors unique to neurodivergent populations. Commonly documented behaviors of hospitalized autistic youth highlight the need for strength-based approaches to meet specific needs of autistic people.",

Children aged 3-17\u00a0years were included. We considered a broader spectrum of NDDs by including behavioral problems and grouped children based on the number of NDDs (out of ten): no multiple NDDs (none or one NDD), two NDDs, three NDDs, four NDDs, and five or more NDDs. Four mental health outcomes were measured: depression (yes/no), anxiety (yes/no), depression severity (mild/moderate/severe), and anxiety severity (mild/moderate/severe). Multinomial logistic regression models were used.\nAmong 267,044 children (mean age\u00a0=\u00a010.2\u00a0years; male\u00a0=\u00a051.8\u00a0%), 10.6\u00a0% had multiple NDDs. The increasing number of co-occurring NDDs was associated with higher odds of prevalence and severity of depression and anxiety. Children with multiple NDDs were 4.7-5.3 times more likely to have depression and 5.8-12.9 times more likely to have anxiety compared with those without multiple NDDs. These positive associations remained consistent for mild or moderate depression (adjusted odds ratios [ORs]: 5.0-5.6) and for mild or moderate anxiety (adjusted ORs: 5.6-8.9). The associations were more pronounced for severe mental health conditions, with children being 7.8-16.9 times more likely to experience severe depression and 8.1-34.9 times more likely to experience severe anxiety.\nThe cumulative mental health burden associated with multiple NDDs emphasizes the need for integrated screening and tailored interventions to support this population.",

This study aimed to identify distinct trajectories leading to first-episode mania (FEM) and first-episode psychosis (FEP) by examining antecedent psychopathology, including psychiatric diagnoses, symptoms, substance use, and psychotropic medication exposure.\nIndividuals born after 1985 who resided in Olmsted County, Minnesota, USA, and had FEM/FEP were identified through the Rochester Epidemiology Project. Latent class analysis (LCA) was used to identify subgroups based on antecedent psychopathology incorporating 57 dichotomous antecedent measures before FEM/FEP.\nA total of 202 individuals (BD n\u2009=\u200973, SZ n\u2009=\u2009129; 26.7% female, mean age 20.8\u2009\u00b1\u20093.7\u2009years) were included. A 3-class LCA model optimally fits the data. Class 1 (Neurodevelopmental, 29.7%) had a high prevalence of neurodevelopmental disorders, behavioral symptoms, and ADHD medication use. Class 2 (Depressive-Anxious, 31.2%) included depressive and anxiety disorders, mood-related symptoms, and SSRI/SNRI use. Class 3 (Minimal Psychiatric Morbidity, 39.1%) had a low prevalence of antecedent diagnoses and symptoms, with comparable substance use to other classes. There were significant diagnostic differences, with SZ being more common in the Neurodevelopmental (71.7%) and Minimal Psychiatric Morbidity (70.9%) classes, while BD was more common in the Depressive-Anxious class (p\u2009=\u20090.007). Neurodevelopmental and Minimal Psychiatric Morbidity classes had higher proportions of males (85.0% and 82.3%, respectively) compared to the Depressive-Anxious class (50.8%, p\u2009<\u20090.001). The Neurodevelopmental class showed an earlier age at first mental health visit (9.5\u2009\u00b1\u20095.5\u2009years) and a longer antecedent illness duration (10.8\u2009\u00b1\u20096.1\u2009years) than the other classes (p\u2009<\u20090.001).\nThis study identified three distinct pathways to FEM and FEP, offering a transdiagnostic perspective on the antecedent illness trajectories of BD and SZ. Future research should validate these categories that are more inclusive than the classic BD versus SZ dichotomy and explore their potential for predicting illness course and guiding personalized early interventions.",

        "abstract": "Perinatal asphyxia remains a leading cause of neonatal mortality and a major contributor to permanent neurological deficits. Even mild cases can result in long-term neurodevelopmental, cognitive, behavioural and psychiatric disorders. However, the mechanisms underlying asphyxia-induced hypoxic-ischaemic brain injury remain poorly understood, limiting the development of targeted interventions during the critical early plastic period. To explore the behavioural and molecular outcomes of perinatal asphyxia that may model important aspects of neuropsychiatric disorders observed in humans, we utilised a translationally relevant, non-invasive oxygen deprivation model of asphyxia in postnatal day 7 rats. We conducted\u00a0a comprehensive assessment of asphyxia-induced changes, integrating neurobehavioural profiling (evaluating cognitive, emotional, social and neuromotor functions), microglial morphology analysis, neuroimaging, stress hormone measurement and whole-transcriptome sequencing techniques to elucidate the acute and long-term functional consequences. Consistent with clinical observations, the extensive functional assessment revealed distinct sex-dependent effects, including increased anxiety and impulsivity, attention deficits and impaired inhibitory control, which were observed exclusively in males, with no apparent sensorimotor deficits. This phenotype resembling attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in adult rats was associated with a lasting increase in inhibitory bouton densities in the medial prefrontal cortex. The development of an acute inflammatory response after perinatal asphyxia marked by phenotypic transformation of microglia, paralleled brain perfusion and stress hormone changes. Notably, microglial changes were mitigated by the blockade of proinflammatory interleukin-1 signalling via systemic IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1RA) administration in a therapeutically relevant time window. Importantly, early blockade of proinflammatory responses was able to prevent cognitive deficits in adulthood and normalise inhibitory bouton densities. RNA sequencing analysis revealed asphyxia-induced dysregulation of molecular pathways targeting GABAergic signalling, potentially contributing to subsequent morphological and neuropsychiatric alterations. IL-1RA treatment appeared to engage distinct epigenetic regulatory mechanisms, rather than merely reversing these disruptions in the acute post-asphyxia period. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that perinatal asphyxia induces marked behavioural deficits in attention and inhibitory control, paralleled by lasting inhibitory and epigenetic dysregulation, preceded by acute induction of microglia-driven inflammatory processes in the medial prefrontal cortex. Systemic IL-1RA administration may represent a promising therapeutic opportunity to prevent long-term cognitive impairments caused by perinatal asphyxia.",

        "abstract": "Recent political statements linking paracetamol (acetaminophen) use during pregnancy to autism spectrum disorders have created concern among patients and healthcare providers worldwide. This editorial critically examines the scientific evidence, highlighting that the largest and most methodologically rigorous population-based studies employing sibling control analyses demonstrate no causal association between prenatal paracetamol exposure and neurodevelopmental disorders. While some observational studies have suggested potential weak associations, these findings likely reflect confounding by indication and familial genetic factors rather than actual causal relationships. The most robust evidence comes from a Swedish population-based study of 2.48 million children, which found no increased risk when controlling for familial confounding. Major international medical organizations including ACOG, RCOG, and FIGO, and regulatory agencies including the European Medicines Agency continue to recommend paracetamol as the safest analgesic option during pregnancy when clinically indicated. The established risks of untreated pain and fever during pregnancy significantly outweigh theoretical concerns based on methodologically limited studies. Healthcare providers should continue evidence-based counseling while avoiding unnecessary anxiety about this essential medication in obstetric practice.",

        "doi": "10.3390/toxics13090710",
        "abstract": "We previously reported that the fathers of the Bien Hoa birth cohort in Vietnam showed altered brain regional gray matter volumes, as measured by magnetic resonance imaging, and social anxiety traits associated with perinatal dioxin exposure. In the present study, we aimed to compare gray matter volumes and social anxiety scale scores between dioxin-exposed fathers in Bien Hoa and unexposed controls in an unsprayed area. Fat-based bioassay-toxic equivalency levels in serum were used to indicate dioxin exposure in adulthood. Results indicated that the longer Bien Hoa residency group (\u226530 years) exposed to dioxins during the perinatal period and early childhood showed higher gray matter volumes in the right and left temporal lobes than controls. However, no significant differences in temporal lobe gray matter volumes were found between the shorter Bien Hoa residency group (<30 years) and controls. Furthermore, the longer, but not shorter, Bien Hoa residency group showed higher social-emotional subscale scores than controls. Additionally, fat-based bioassay-toxic equivalency levels were inversely correlated with gray matter volumes in several right temporal gyri. These findings suggest biphasic life stage-dependent adverse effects of dioxin exposure: perinatal dioxin exposure increases gray matter volumes, especially in the temporal lobe, which leads to neurodevelopmental disorders with socio-emotional disturbances, whereas dioxin exposure after brain development decreases cortical gray matter volumes, possibly leading to cognitive dysfunction.",

        "doi": "10.3390/ijms26188931",
        "abstract": "Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) involves complex genetic-environmental interactions. Prenatal valproic acid (VPA) exposure, a known environmental risk factor, induces ASD-like phenotypes in rodents, although the mechanisms linking gut microbiota dysbiosis to neurobehavioral deficits remain unclear. Evidence suggests gut-brain axis dysregulation via altered microbial diversity and reduced short-chain fatty acid (SCFA)-producing taxa contributes to ASD pathogenesis. This study investigated whether prenatal VPA exposure drives ASD-like behaviors through gut dysbiosis and SCFA-producer depletion (e.g., Clostridia, Lachnospiraceae), exploring neuroinflammation and oxidative stress as mechanisms. An ASD rat model was established by maternal VPA injection during specific gestational days. Behavioral tests assessed anxiety, sociability, repetitive behaviors, and cognition. Gut microbiota composition (16S rRNA sequencing), cytokine levels (ELISA), oxidative stress markers (biochemical assays), and microglial activation (Iba1 immunofluorescence) were analyzed. VPA-exposed offspring showed ASD-like behaviors accompanied by neurodevelopmental toxicity, manifesting as social deficits, repetitive grooming, and impaired memory. Concurrently, gut analysis revealed reduced alpha diversity and depleted SCFA-producers (e.g., Clostridia, Lachnospiraceae), alongside increased Bacteroidia and Enterobacteriaceae. Neuroinflammation (elevated IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, microglial activation) and oxidative stress (reduced GSH, SOD; elevated MDA, NO) were evident. Multivariate analyses linked dysbiosis to behavioral impairments. Prenatal VPA exposure induces gut microbiota dysbiosis, potentially exacerbating neuroinflammation and oxidative stress to drive ASD-like phenotypes. This establishes a mechanistic link between prenatal insults, gut-brain axis disruption, and neurodevelopmental abnormalities, highlighting microbial modulation and SCFA supplementation as potential ASD therapeutics. Furthermore, integrating behavioral, microbial, and molecular analyses advances understanding of gut-brain interactions in ASD and identifies microbiota-metabolite pathways as targets for neurodevelopmental disorders.",

Characterized by a range of symptoms affecting social interaction, communication, and behavior, ASD presents a spectrum of varying degrees of severity and presentation. Recent research emphasizes the importance of understanding the diverse manifestations of ASD across different populations. Core features include social communication differences and restricted and repetitive behaviors (RRBs), often linked to co-occurring conditions such as anxiety and ADHD. The study of ASD has evolved significantly, highlighting the need for individualized approaches to diagnosis and intervention. This paper explores current knowledge on ASD, examining the latest research findings and discussing future directions for improving the lives of those affected by the disorder. The purpose is to present a map of the field and an evidence-strength framing of what is known and unknown, and where the evidence is equivocal. Key areas of focus include behavioral, psychological, genetic, metabolic, immunological, and neurological features, as well as developmental and maturational factors. The aim is to provide a comprehensive overview of what is known, what remains unclear, and where future research should be directed.",

These disorders are associated with neural abnormalities, but it is unclear when these emerge and how this relates to the development of different mental health problems.\nWe identified children who developed mental health problems over two years and controls who remained healthy from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study. Six mental health conditions (N\u00a0=\u00a058 to N\u00a0=\u00a0173) were compared to controls (N\u00a0=\u00a02500) using separate linear models to assess group differences at baseline and in neurodevelopment for six disorders and six modalities. Shared neurodevelopmental changes were assessed by comparing spatial patterns of brain alterations across conditions at baseline and over time.\nThe baseline data showed brain-wide abnormalities in children who later developed mental health problems, which were comparable between internalizing problems and different from externalizing problems. Brain-region specific abnormalities were limited to individuals who later developed oppositional defiant symptoms. The longitudinal data showed differential neurodevelopmental trajectories for specific brain regions in adolescents who developed ADHD, conduct and anxiety problems, as well as brain-wide neurodevelopmental abnormalities that were comparable between mental health problem groups compared to controls.\nOur findings reveal both shared and problem-specific neural abnormalities, providing critical insights into the evolving neurobiological mechanisms that underlie both shared and distinct mental health problems, highlighting how disorder-specific and transdiagnostic brain abnormalities emerge across development.",

        "doi": "10.22365/jpsych.2025.023",
        "abstract": "Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is classified among the neurodevelopmental disorders, which are described in the early chapters of DSM-51 and ICD-11.2 These disorders emerge in childhood, persist across the lifespan, and are characterized by deficits or diversities that affect personal, social, academic, and occupational functioning. Although the two major diagnostic systems have converged in terminology and criteria-with only minor differences in the categorization of co-occurring language and intellectual development disorders-Greece continues to rely on ICD-10, leading to difficulties in the consistent use of terminology among mental health professionals. The global rise in ASD prevalence over recent decades has been widely discussed, largely attributed to broadened diagnostic criteria and increased recognition in groups where autism was previously considered rare, such as women and individuals with milder symptoms. In the United States, current estimates suggest that 1 in 31 children may be diagnosed with ASD.3 In adults, the prevalence is consistently found to be lower. In Greece, the estimated prevalence based on diagnoses recorded by the Diagnostic, Assessment, and Counseling Centers (KEDASY) is 1.15%,4 while no epidemiological data exist for adults. The lifetime cost of care for an individual with autism may exceed 2 million USD.5 The socioeconomic burden in Greece has been exacerbated by the financial crisis, which had a more detrimental impact on families of individuals with autism than the COVID-19 pandemic.6 A critical gap in care has been documented internationally during the transition from adolescence to adulthood. Adults with autism frequently encounter the \"double empathy problem,\" referring to reciprocal difficulties in their communication with neurotypical individuals. This, coupled with the stigma surrounding the diagnosis, often results in misjudgments regarding the abilities and needs of people with autism. Among adults with ASD, depression is the most prevalent and impairing co-occurring psychiatric disorder, often accompanied by anxiety disorders, both of which contribute to marked reductions in functioning, particularly during transitional periods.7-9 For the so-called \"lost generation\" of adults with autism-those with normal intelligence and relatively functional profiles whose diagnosis was missed earlier-an ASD diagnosis may resolve longstanding diagnostic uncertainty and explain treatment resistance in psychiatric disorders. Management of ASD and psychiatric comorbidities requires individualized treatment planning that integrates psychosocial interventions and targeted, when needed, pharmacological strategies. Multidisciplinary collaboration among professionals is essential, while active family involvement is of fundamental importance.10 In the era of precision medicine, its applicability to ASD depends on a comprehensive understanding of genetic, temperamental, and environmental factors, enabling personalized interventions that may enhance treatment effectiveness and reduce costs. Implementation of such approaches presupposes specialized training of mental health professionals. In Greece, structured training in adult autism for psychiatrists is limited or absent, resulting in delayed or inaccurate diagnoses, reduced access to appropriate services, and inadequate psychiatric care for adults with autism. While the curriculum of child psychiatry specialty provides training for autism in childhood, there is no continuity into adult psychiatry, even though adulthood spans the majority of life. The lack of training contributes to frequent misdiagnoses (particularly among women and individuals from the \"lost generation\"), inappropriate pharmacological treatments, and the mischaracterization of adults with autism 2 as \"non-compliant.\" Consequently, many individuals with autism and their families are deprived of psychoeducation and necessary support. To address these shortcomings, we propose the integration of a dedicated module on adult ASD into the official psychiatry residency curriculum in Greece, alongside clinical training in autism-specialized services and acquisition of experience in the use of standardized assessment tools. Such measures are essential to improve diagnostic accuracy, ensure continuity of care, and enhance the quality of psychiatric services for adults with autism.",

GWAS have uncovered several loci associated with suicidality phenotypes by meta-analyzing data from multiple cohorts. However, combining datasets from many research groups, where each group may use different study designs, phenotyping instruments, and definitions of suicidality phenotypes, presents challenges. Heterogeneity resulting from these differences can limit genetic discovery; harmonizing phenotype definitions to ensure consistency will greatly improve results. Here, we describe a standardized phenotyping protocol that draws on the expertise of a subgroup of clinicians, researchers, and experts from the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium Suicide Working Group to propose consensus definitions for SI, SA, and SD for genetic studies.",

        "abstract": "Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a heterogeneous neurodevelopmental condition characterized by underdeveloped social cognition, along with restricted interests and repetitive behaviors. ASD manifests through a range of genetic, environmental, and psychosocial factors, which influence brain development and lead to maladaptive social and behavioral processes. While early diagnosis is common, ASD traits can develop and express themselves through various stages of childhood, driven by dynamic changes in cognitive and social abilities in relation to stressors and challenges. A recent study reports genomic and psychological evidence for two different age-related trajectories of autism development, one early, and one later and near the time of adrenarche and middle childhood, around ages 7 - 10. Given that middle childhood represents a key period for the development of social cognition including complex theory of mind and peer relationships, that adrenarche mediates the origin and social adaptations of middle childhood, and that social challenges increase with its onset, we hypothesize that autism onset, expression and diagnoses during this period may involve alterations to adrenarche, and to its endocrinological and neurological bases. Adrenarche involves onset and increase in secretion of the androgens dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and its sulfate (DHEAS). A series of systematic reviews was conducted to evaluate the hypothesis that DHEA or DHEAS levels are associated with ASD, autism spectrum traits, or aspects of brain development relevant to autism. The reviews showed that: (1) higher DHEA demonstrated evidence of positive associations with aspects of internalizing and externalizing, including social anxiety, with especially notable effects in girls, and (2) higher DHEA showed evidence of association with ASD diagnoses overall, as also indicated by a recent meta-analysis. These findings provide initial support for the hypothesis that alterations to the social adaptations associated with adrenarche, and DHEA levels in middle childhood may underlie a subtype of autism with diagnosis during this developmental period.",

        "abstract": "\u03b3-aminobutyric acid (GABA), the primary inhibitory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system (CNS), regulates neuronal excitability, synaptic plasticity, and oscillatory activity essential for cognition, emotion, and behavior. Disruptions in GABAergic signaling are increasingly recognized as key contributors to a range of neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs), including schizophrenia (SZ), autism spectrum disorder (ASD), major depressive disorder (MDD), bipolar disorder (BD), and intellectual disability (ID). In this review, we analyze the data available from the literature concerning the components of the GABA pathway. We describe the main steps of GABA metabolism, including GABA synthesis and release, GABA receptors neurotransmission, GABA reuptake and catabolism, and evaluate their involvement in the pathogenesis of neurodevelopmental disorders. We suggest the possibility of existence of so far undescribed mechanisms which maintain the concentrations of GABA at a relatively physiological level when the function of glutamic acid decarboxylases is compromised by mutations. Searching for these mechanisms could be important for better understanding neurodevelopment and could give a clue for future searches for new therapeutic approaches for treating or alleviating the symptoms of BD and SZ. We also argue that the metabolic stage of the GABA pathway has only a minor direct effect on GABA signaling and rather causes clinical effects due to accumulation of neurotoxic byproducts.",

        "abstract": "Glycosylation functions as a pivotal posttranslational modification in proteins and as a distinct biosynthetic process in lipids. In the brain, it plays essential roles in development, function and homeostasis by modulating protein folding, receptor trafficking and intercellular communication. Although glycans constitute less than 1% of the brain's mass, their impact is disproportionately profound. Recent technological advances have uncovered the essential contributions of both protein- and lipid-bound glycans, including N-glycans, O-glycans and gangliosides, to brain physiology and disease. Here we explore the emerging landscape of brain glycosylation, highlighting its distinct roles in neurodevelopment, synaptic organization and immune regulation. Aberrant glycosylation has been implicated in neurodegenerative diseases (for example, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's), psychiatric disorders (for example, depression and schizophrenia) and neurodevelopmental conditions (for example, autism spectrum disorders, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and dystroglycanopathies). We summarize recent breakthroughs in glycomics technologies, including glycan enrichment, liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, MALDI-based imaging mass spectrometry and high-throughput omics, which enable molecular and spatial mapping of brain glycosylation. Artificial-intelligence-driven bioinformatics and multi-omics integration are rapidly opening new avenues for deciphering glycan-mediated regulation in brain health and disease. Together, these developments position brain glycosylation as a transformative frontier in neuroscience, with the potential to yield novel diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic strategies for complex brain disorders.",

        "doi": "10.2196/64474",
        "abstract": "Disciplining a child is a complex, multidimensional aspect of parenting, involving emotional guidance, behavioral correction, and consistent communication. Disciplinary practices applied to children may vary due to social, cultural, and geographic contexts. Among these practices, child shaking and its potentially severe consequences, including traumatic brain injury and long-term neurodevelopmental impairments, are more frequently documented in high-income countries. Although child shaking also occurs in low- and middle-income countries, particularly among infants, where it is primarily triggered by persistent crying, it is rarely reported in formal studies. Moreover, primary caregivers, particularly mothers, may not perceive shaking as a form of punitive discipline, and maternal depression is often associated with their caregiving attitude toward children. Furthermore, notable functional variations are also observed in the parenting practices of low-income urban and rural mothers, often influenced by divergent socioeconomic and environmental factors.\nThis study aims to explore caregivers' use of shaking as a disciplinary practice with young children in lower-income urban and rural communities in Bangladesh and identify the underlying factors associated with this behavior.\nThis was a cross-sectional study in which we randomly interviewed 800 caregivers of children (aged <2 y) admitted to the hospitals of the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh, in urban Dhaka (n=520, 65%) and rural Matlab (n=280, 35%). We collected detailed information on how they disciplined their young children (index children), with particular emphasis on shaking behavior. The questionnaires also explored perceived causes and common beliefs related to child shaking, in addition to collecting information on sociodemographic characteristics and caregivers' depression. All analyses were conducted using SPSS software.\nChild shaking was higher in lower-income communities of Dhaka compared to rural Matlab (n=265, 51% vs n=52, 19%; P<.001). Mothers, as the primary caregivers, mostly used shaking as a disciplinary practice with their young children (n=491, 61%). Overall, 27% (n=214) of primary caregivers reported ever shaking a child below 2 years; among these, 62% (n=133) reported shaking at least 3 to 5 times. Crying and fussing were the main triggering factors (Dhaka: n=107, 62% vs Matlab: n=26, 67%) for shaking behavior, particularly in infants aged younger than 6 months. Approximately 56.6% (n=99) of the mothers in Dhaka and 28.2% (n=11) of the mothers in Matlab believed that shaking was either definitely or probably harmless. Maternal depression was significantly correlated (adjusted odds ratio 1.03, 95% CI 1.01-1.04; P=.001) with shaking practices used by mothers.\nShaking young children as a form of discipline is quite prevalent in lower-income communities of Bangladesh, where poverty and other stressors are common. Caregivers are not fully aware of the harmful side effects of infant shaking. Positive parenting programs need to be strengthened to reduce these harmful behaviors toward children to support their developmental potential.",

        "abstract": "Pregnancy-related disorders, such as hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP) and postpartum depression, have consequences for maternal health, increasing risk for major depressive disorder (MDD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Observational studies show intertwined pathophysiologies and shared cardiovascular factors. However, genetic links of cardiovascular factors with pregnancy-related disorders, MDD, and AD, as well as the genetic mechanisms between the disorders, have not been fully established.\nUsing summary statistics from female-specific genome-wide association studies, we estimated genetic correlations and causal associations, using Mendelian randomization, between cardiovascular factors (C-reactive protein, HDL-cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, and triglycerides), pregnancy-related disorders (HDP and postpartum depression), MDD, and AD. For significant associations, BMI, as a known confounder, was included in multivariable Mendelian randomization analyses. Further, we applied causal mixture models (MiXeR) to explore polygenic overlap between pregnancy-related disorders, MDD, and BMI.\nWe found widespread genetic correlations between cardiovascular factors, pregnancy-related disorders, and MDD. Using Mendelian randomization, higher triglycerides and lower HDL-cholesterol were causally linked to higher HDP risk, and higher LDL-cholesterol to higher AD risk. When including BMI, only the effect of triglycerides on HDP remained significant. Trivariate MiXeR estimated substantial polygenic overlap of pregnancy-related disorders with MDD and BMI.\nUsing multiple genetic approaches, our findings indicate some shared cardiovascular factors associated with pregnancy-related disorders, MDD, and AD, partly driven by BMI. BMI should be further explored as a modifiable factor genetically linked to pregnancy-related, mental, and brain disorders. Our findings highlight the relevance of early prevention of genetically interconnected disorders across the female lifespan.",

Here we conducted a meta-analysis of methylome-wide association analysis for lifetime MD across 18 studies of 24,754 European-ancestry participants (5,443 MD cases) and an East Asian sample (243 cases, 1,846 controls). We identified 15 CpG sites associated with lifetime MD with methylome-wide significance. The methylation score created using the methylome-wide association analysis summary statistics was significantly associated with MD status in an out-of-sample classification analysis (area under the curve\u20090.53). Methylation score was also associated with five inflammatory markers, with the strongest association found with tumor necrosis factor beta. Mendelian randomization analysis revealed 23 CpG sites potentially causally linked to MD, with 7 replicated in an independent dataset. Our study provides evidence that variations in DNA methylation are associated with MD, and further evidence supporting involvement of the immune system.",

        "doi": "10.3389/fpsyt.2025.1630528",
        "abstract": "Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) has a long-standing history of being strongly associated with multiple psychiatric comorbidities, including substance use disorders (SUDs) and eating disorders (EDs) like anorexia nervosa (AN). ASD-specific features, including repetitive behaviors, constricted interests, cognitive rigidity, and obsessive fixations, are believed to make patients with ASD vulnerable to SUD and ED development. However, little research attempts to understand the interconnection between ASD and these comorbidities. We present a case of a 26-year-old man with a long-standing diagnosis of ASD who developed SUD and restrictive food intake, culminating in the patient meeting the AN criteria. This patient voluntarily admitted himself to the inpatient psychiatric unit with worsening depression and suicidal ideation following a car accident resulting from sleep deprivation and acute cannabis intoxication. Further investigation revealed a problematic, obsessive pattern of initial alcohol use associated with weight gain, followed by profound food restriction and subsequent transition to daily, near-constant cannabis use. On presentation, he appeared anxious with overt signs of sleep deprivation and malnutrition from substantial weight loss with a body mass index (BMI) decline from 23.6 to 16.98 over the last year. A urine drug screen was positive for cannabinoids, and imaging was unremarkable. Over an 11-day hospitalization, a multidisciplinary team initiated anxiolytics, antidepressants, sleep aids, and cannabis-withdrawal management combined with nutritional rehabilitation under dietitian supervision until acute suicidality was resolved with an improved BMI to 18.75. At discharge, the patient reported eagerness to engage with outpatient psychotherapy, ongoing psychiatric follow-up, and ASD-adapted cognitive behavioral therapy. This case underscores the diagnostic and management implications associated with co-occurring ASD, SUD, and ED. Obsessive fixation and rigidity potentiate maladaptive coping, which, if unaddressed in therapy, may increase the risk of future SUD and ED relapse. Though rapid inpatient stabilization is possible, gaps in both specialty care and ASD-adapted programs may compound relapse risk, especially in underserved regions. Additionally, this case necessitates a comprehensive assessment of patients with neurodevelopmental disorders for more informed and integrated therapeutic intervention. The nuanced interplay between ASD, SUD, and ED has synergistic effects on caloric restriction, requiring multidisciplinary treatment strategies to achieve sustained recovery and reduce morbidity in a vulnerable population.",

Additionally, parents/carers of autistic CYP and CYP with ID will tell their story of the needs and experiences of their child verbally.\nThis study results will help to share the needs and experiences of the autistic CYP and CYP with ID, or a co-occurrence of both diagnoses and expose the barriers to accessing mental health services for autistic CYP and CYP with ID.\nRecommendations will include guidance on decision-making for referrals, assessment, and treatment provision for autistic CYP and CYP with ID and co-occurring mental health difficulties.\nChildren and young people with a neurodevelopmental difference, such as autism or intellectual disability, are 4.5 times more likely to experience anxiety or depression than their peers, known as a co-occurring mental health difficulty. Furthermore, 27.4% of referrals to mental health services in 2023\u201324 were children and young people under 18, with a neurodevelopmental difference, emphasising the need for early intervention from mental health services. Autistic children and young people and children and young people with intellectual disability are either told that they do not meet the criteria for mental health provision or find it difficult to engage with the psychological therapies offered following the assessment stage. This study will carry out narrative interviews with autistic children and young people, children and young people with intellectual disability and their parents or carers, where individuals can share their stories, including needs and experiences when using mental health services. The study supports the government's emphasis on early intervention and prevention of mental health difficulties. It will provide valuable recommendations for future service planning and mental health provision strategies for autistic children and young people and children and young people with intellectual disability.",

This case highlights the critical need for precautionary measures, prompt treatment, and continuous observation following such exposure, emphasizing its significant clinical implications.\nA 3-year-old Ethiopian boy, who was previously healthy and neurodevelopmentally normal, was brought to the pediatric emergency department after inadvertently chewing and swallowing the parts of Dieffenbachia plant. Initially, he had mild symptoms and signs, including oral and throat irritation and laryngeal and pharyngeal erythema, which were neglected by the parents, leading to respiratory depression, desaturation, seizures, and airway edema on laryngoscope examination. The child's blood counts, renal function, liver enzymes, electrolytes, and blood glucose tests were normal. His case was initially managed in the emergency department with supportive medications, including steroids, antihistamines, acid suppressants, and analgesics. Later, there was a need for immediate intubation and mechanical ventilator support, as the patient developed impending respiratory failure due to upper airway obstruction. The child eventually fully recovered after a few days, with no residual sequelae.\nIt is essential to seek immediate medical attention if individuals are exposed to the toxic Dieffenbachia plant and to closely monitor them for any late symptoms or complications for a minimum of 24\u00a0hours, particularly in cases involving the digestive system and airway.",

        "doi": "10.1177/08862605251375358",
        "abstract": "Individuals with Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) are at an increased risk of suicidal ideation and attempts compared to the general population. However, the mechanisms underlying suicidal behaviors in this group remain poorly understood. The role of childhood trauma, which frequently co-occurs with ADHD, and emotional dysregulation in suicidal behaviors remains unclear. This study employs a case-control design to investigate the impact of childhood trauma and emotional dysregulation on suicidal tendencies in adults with ADHD. A total of 160 adults diagnosed with ADHD who presented to the Adult Neurodevelopmental Disorders Clinic at Sel\u00e7uk University, along with 107 typical controls, were included in the study. Participants were assessed using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-5, Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale, Suicidal Ideation Scale, Childhood Trauma Questionnaire, and the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale-Short Form. Regression and mediation models were conducted to examine factors influencing suicidal tendencies, controlling for sociodemographic and clinical variables. Compared to controls, individuals with ADHD exhibited significantly higher levels of suicidal ideation, childhood trauma, and emotional dysregulation. Regression analysis revealed a positive association between childhood trauma, emotional dysregulation, and suicidal ideation. However, ADHD symptoms did not directly contribute to increased suicidal ideation; rather, their effect was mediated through childhood trauma and emotional dysregulation. Additionally, the presence of depression was significantly associated with both suicide attempts and suicidal ideation. These findings suggest that childhood trauma and difficulties in emotion regulation play critical roles in suicidal ideation among individuals with ADHD. In addition to depression treatment, comprehensive interventions targeting childhood trauma and emotional dysregulation may serve as promising strategies for reducing suicidal behaviors.",

        "doi": "10.1016/j.bpsgos.2025.100574",
        "abstract": "The heterogeneous nature of psychiatric disorders complicates their clinical management and the development of novel treatments, imposing a significant burden on both patients and health care systems. To address these challenges, it is essential to continuously identify new targets involved in their pathogenesis. In this narrative review, we propose the dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase (DDAH) proteins, already known for their significant role in cardiovascular disease, as promising novel treatment targets for psychiatric conditions. The DDAH proteins exist in 2 isoforms, DDAH1 and DDAH2, which both regulate nitric oxide homeostasis. DDAH1 metabolizes the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA), while DDAH2 acts through ADMA-independent mechanisms. We synthesize current evidence from systemic studies, genetic analyses, postmortem brain samples, and animal models to evaluate the potential roles of DDAH proteins across psychiatric conditions. Most systemic studies have revealed increased peripheral ADMA levels across several psychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia, depression, bipolar disorder, substance use disorders, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Alterations in ADMA levels are also observed in transdiagnostic clinical domains such as cognitive deficits, sleep disturbances, white matter hyperintensities, and oxidative stress. These ADMA changes are evident from early stages of illness and respond to current treatments, suggesting diagnostic potential. Genetic and postmortem brain data further link DDAH1 and DDAH2 to psychiatric symptomatology in patient populations. Finally, fundamental studies in model systems provide insights into their role in neural proliferation, differentiation, cell death, and oxidative stress regulation-key processes in the developing and the adult brain. These data support the view that DDAH proteins may play a role in the molecular mechanisms that underlie psychiatric disorders and merit more investigation as potential therapeutic candidates.\nIn this review, we highlight the relevance of DDAH proteins, key regulators of nitric oxide balance, for psychiatric research. Evidence from genetic studies, brain tissue, and animal models links DDAH1 and DDAH2 to core psychiatric symptoms, supporting their relevance across disorders and underscoring the need for further investigation.",

        "doi": "10.3390/biomedicines13092104",
        "abstract": "Recent studies increasingly highlight the complex interaction between gut microbiota and mental health, drawing attention to the role of the microbiota-gut-brain axis (MGBA) in the pathophysiology of mental and neurodevelopmental disorders. Changes in the composition of the gut microbiota-dysbiosis-are associated with conditions such as depression, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder (BD), autism spectrum disorders (ASD), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's. These microbial imbalances can affect brain function through a variety of mechanisms, including activation of the immune system, alteration of intestinal permeability, modulation of the digestive and central nervous systems, and changes in the production of neuroactive metabolites such as short-chain fatty acids, serotonin, and tryptophan derivatives. The aim of this paper is to review the current state of knowledge on therapeutic strategies targeting the gut microbiome-including probiotics, prebiotics, synbiotics, personalized dietary interventions, and fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT)-which are becoming promising adjuncts or alternatives to conventional psychopharmacology, offering a forward-looking and individualized approach to mental health treatment. Understanding the bidirectional and multifactorial nature of MGBA may pave the way for new, integrative treatment paradigms in psychiatry and neurology, requiring further research and exploration of their scope of application.",

Most brain IDPs show low-to-moderate SNP-based heritability, lower than typically observed in adults. Sparse generalized canonical correlation analysis reveals positive associations between cognitive-related PGS and structural MRI features (e.g., total grey matter and ventral diencephalon volumes) and N-back task-related activation, while PGS for ADHD, depression, and neuroticism showed negative associations. Cognitive PGS also correlates positively with diffusion MRI metrics (streamline counts, fractional anisotropy in subcortical-frontal tracts and inferior parietal-subcortical tracts), whereas health-risk PGS (e.g., BMI, ADHD) correlates negatively. This study delineates key gene-brain-behavior associations in preadolescence, providing a multivariate dissection of the polygenic architecture underlying neurodevelopment.",

Here, human participants undergo functional magnetic resonance imaging and continuous eye gaze monitoring while studying scene images. Recognition memory is probed immediately thereafter. Results reveal saccade-based grid-like codes in the left entorhinal cortex that are specific to later remembered trials during study, a finding that we replicate with an independent data set. The grid-related effects are time-locked to activation increases in the frontal eye fields. Unexpectedly, lower saccade-based grid-like codes are associated with better subsequent recognition memory performance.

Histological analysis confirmed IgG4-related disease, despite the absence of systemic involvement. This is the first reported case of isolated IgG4-related uveitis diagnosed by vitrectomy, avoiding enucleation. The procedure also provided therapeutic benefit, resolving pain and inflammation.

Physical activity is recommended for individuals with RA, and health-enhancing physical activity (HEPA) has been shown to improve health perception and physical fitness in this group. However, the molecular adaptations of skeletal muscle in response to an exercise intervention are still unexplored in individuals with RA. This study aimed to assess the skeletal muscle response to a 2-year HEPA intervention in individuals with RA.\nThirteen individuals with RA (65\u2009\u00b1\u20092\u00a0years old, 13\u2009\u00b1\u20092\u00a0years disease duration) participated. The 2-year HEPA intervention involved 150\u00a0min of weekly moderately intense aerobic activity and twice-weekly circuit training. Practical and theoretical physiotherapist support was available the first year, but not the second year. Skeletal muscle biopsies, functional assessments, and mass spectrometry-based proteomics analysis were conducted.\nCompliance was high the first year but dropped significantly the second year. Functional improvements in strength, endurance, and lower extremity muscle function (TST) were observed after year 1. Proteomics analysis revealed significant enrichment of mitochondrial proteins including COX8A, citrate synthase, M2OM, NDUFA6, NDUFS2, and VDAC3 after year 1, indicating positive muscle adaptations. However, these changes regressed to baseline levels by year 2.\nHEPA can induce beneficial mitochondrial adaptations in skeletal muscle of individuals with RA. However, insufficient compliance and progression in HEPA exercise load led to a reversal of these adaptations. Continuous support and motivation are crucial for maintaining and progressing exercise levels and muscle health in individuals with RA.

        "abstract": "Intensive care unit (ICU) admissions for patients with substance use disorders (SUDs) pose challenging problems for family members (FMs) and healthcare professionals (HCWs). This qualitative study explores the perceptions and challenges faced by families and HCWs caring for these patients and identifies strategies to improve care quality.\nUsing an inductive grounded theory approach, semistructured interviews were conducted with 38 stakeholders (15 FMs,14 nurses, and 9 doctors) taking care of SUD patients in the ICU, until themes were saturated. Following the Gioia methodology, transcripts were coded to identify themes and aggregate dimensions.\nThree aggregate dimensions emerged: (1) Affective response spectrum, which included the themes of emotional experiences, care experiences, and causal attribution; (2) Clinical intervention paradigms, with two themes: nonpharmacological and pharmacological management; and (3) Systematic transformation imperatives (institutional policy development and family support enhancements). Healthcare workers initially experienced stigma towards patients, which gradually transformed into empathy over time. Families, contrary to HCWs' expectation, demonstrated candid disclosure in the interest of their patient's well-being.\nImproving care for ICU patients with SUDs requires a comprehensive approach. Along with addressing the associated underlying stigma and emotional burdens, recommended changes include developing institutional policies and protocols, specialized training, interdisciplinary collaboration, and enhanced family support systems. These findings highlight the need for integrated approaches combining counseling, evidence-based pharmacological management, and systematic transformations in critical care contexts.\nMahajan RK, Miglani M, Upadhyay P, Kaur M, Kaur J, Gautam PL.

        "abstract": "This study compares the quality of life (QoL) assessment using the glaucoma QoL (GQL-15), where patients rate their actual status for each of the four domains of visual disability, with that when the relative importance of each domain is reported by the patient.\nThis observational, cross-sectional pilot study, conducted at a tertiary care hospital in North India, enrolled 37 patients with moderate to severe glaucoma. Each patient was administered the GQL-15 questionnaire. After each question was answered, the patient was asked to indicate the relative weighting of each domain, and the answer was graded from 1 to 5. The overall QoL score was obtained by multiplying each level of functioning with each domain weight and then adding these products. The individualized measures so obtained, divided by 5, were considered as a real-world measure of personalized QoL of the patient. Personalized QoL was compared to the standard GQL-15 score.\nThe mean age of the patients was 63.86 \u00b1 11.08 years, with male predominance (67.57%). Patients reported the highest visual impairment with walking on uneven ground (score = 2.70 \u00b1 1.31), seeing at night (score = 2.54 \u00b1 1.44), and reading newspapers (score = 2.51 \u00b1 1.36). Patients gave the highest weightage to recognizing faces (score = 3.97 \u00b1 0.64), and finding dropped objects (score = 3.73 \u00b1 0.77). Highest score was bagged by seeing at night (8.35 \u00b1 5.590 and adjusting to dim lights (8.35 \u00b1 6.05, respectively), on analysis of the weighted GQL scores.\nPatients with moderate to severe glaucoma prioritize recognizing faces and finding dropped objects. The patients who reported greater difficulty in lighting-related tasks, as well as peripheral and distance vision, also gave it more importance. Individualizing QoL measures is necessary for a better understanding of the patients' perception of their visual disability.\nBhartiya S, Ichhpujani P, Kapoor S, ",

        "abstract": "Systemic sclerosis (SSc) exhibits sex-related disparities in prevalence, clinical features, and outcomes. While women are more frequently affected, men often experience a more severe disease course, including diffuse cutaneous involvement, interstitial lung disease, and reduced survival. These differences are shaped by biological factors such as sex hormones and genetic influences. Estrogens and androgens differentially influence immune and fibrotic pathways, while life stages such as menopause further modulate disease expression. Genetic mechanisms, including X chromosome inactivation, regulation of immune-related genes, and cell signaling pathways, vary between sexes and also play an important role in the sex bias seen in SSc. In addition to these biological aspects, gender, as a sociocultural factor involving roles, behaviors, and access to care, may further modify disease perception, healthcare engagement, and outcomes, though it remains underexplored in SSc research. Treatment responses may also vary by sex, as suggested by emerging studies, but sex-specific clinical recommendations are still lacking. This review aims to summarize current knowledge on sex-related differences in SSc and highlight implications for clinical management and future research.\nUnderstanding how sex influences Systemic Sclerosis: From underlying causes to symptoms and treatment Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is a complex autoimmune disease that affects the skin and internal organs. It is more common in women than in men, but men often experience a more severe disease course. This includes greater organ involvement and poorer overall outcomes. Biological factors, such as sex hormones and genetic differences, are thought to play a central role in these disparities. Estrogens and androgens affect immune responses and the development of fibrosis in different ways. Changes in hormone levels across life stages, such as during menopause, can also influence how the disease appears. Genetic mechanisms, including how genes on the X chromosome are expressed, contribute further to the differences seen between men and women. In addition to these biological influences, gender-related factors, such as differences in social roles, health behaviors, and access to care, may also affect how people experience the disease and respond to treatment. However, these aspects are still poorly studied in SSc. This review outlines the current understanding of how sex shapes the development, clinical presentation, and treatment responses in SSc, and emphasizes the need for more personalized approaches in both research and clinical care.",

Understanding the knowledge, attitudes, practices and perceptions of dengue's eco-bio-social factors among at-risk populations is essential for dengue prevention. We used the Ecohealth approach to investigate the socioeconomic and demographic factors associated with dengue knowledge, attitudes, practices and perceptions among residents of S\u00e3o Paulo.\nWe conducted a concurrent nested mixed-methods study between May and November 2024 using an online knowledge, attitudes, practices and perceptions survey, focus group discussions and Photovoice activity. Quantitative data were analysed using descriptive statistics and multivariable logistic regressions. Adjusted odds ratios (aORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. Qualitative data were analysed thematically. Integration from both method strands used a weaving, narrative approach.\nOverall, 388 participants completed the knowledge, attitudes, practices and perceptions survey. Having some or a lot of vegetation around the home (aOR 2.63, 95% CI: 1.05-6.60; aOR 3.90, 95% CI: 1.57-9.69, respectively) and never having dengue (self-reported; aOR 1.80, 95% CI: 1.10-2.94) were associated with high knowledge scores. Higher education was associated with positive vaccine attitudes (aOR 2.04, 95% CI: 1.14-3.64). Women (aOR 1.57, 95% CI: 1.01-2.45) and individuals with three and more than three household members (aOR 2.04, 95% CI: 1.07-3.87; aOR 3.10, 95% CI: 1.62-5.94, respectively) had higher odds of using mosquito repellents at home. Those who earned more than R$6000 monthly had higher odds of having a high perception of self-efficacy to prevent dengue compared to those who earned less than R$2000 monthly (aOR 2.03, 95% CI: 1.08-3.82). Focus group discussions and Photovoice participants perceived climate change as a risk factor of dengue transmission. The high cost of mosquito repellents was a perceived challenge to prevention.\nSeveral individual- and household-level factors were associated with dengue knowledge, attitudes, practices and perceptions in S\u00e3o Paulo. There is a need to increase public awareness about dengue and its vaccine. Future research should assess the effectiveness of community-tailored interventions to reduce dengue risk in this urban, climate-vulnerable setting.",

Here, we extend investigations to the vestibular control of uprightness during stance using galvanic vestibular stimulation (GVS) under various proprioceptive and visual conditions. An appropriately directed response to GVS requires spatial transformation of the vestibular signal based on head orientation relative to the feet, while non-vestibular sensory information can modulate the magnitude of response. Balance responses were repeatedly evoked in healthy participants (n\u00a0=\u00a021) and participants with AD (tAD: n\u00a0=\u00a018; PCA: n\u00a0=\u00a018) under conditions evaluating proprioceptive-vestibular integration (head directed right, straight or left without vision), or visuo-vestibular integration (head directed straight with or without vision). Across head directions without vision, GVS-evoked response direction and magnitude were comparable across groups. These comparable responses without vision indicate sparing of vestibulo-motor systems and proprioceptive-vestibular integration predicated on transformations between head, body and leg coordinates. However, the modulating effect of vision on GVS-evoked response magnitude was decreased in PCA relative to control and tAD groups. This relatively decreased effect of vision in PCA was evident through the earliest mechanical indicator of response, consistent with reduced feedforward effects of vision on vestibularly driven balance response. Exaggerated response magnitude with vision was associated with occipito-thalamic volumetric and projection fibre abnormalities in PCA. The findings suggest candidate pathways for visual modulation of vestibular balance control and dissociations between systems responsible for perceiving uprightness versus rapid sensorimotor balance control. KEY POINTS: Accurate balance control relies on the integration of vestibular, proprioceptive and visual inputs, transformed across spatial reference frames. We examined whole-body balance responses to galvanic vestibular stimulation (GVS) under varying visual and proprioceptive conditions in people with posterior cortical atrophy (PCA), typical Alzheimer's disease (tAD) and controls. Without vision, GVS-evoked balance responses were comparable across groups with the head turned left, right or straight ahead, indicating spared proprioceptive-vestibular integration in patient groups. With vision, visual input had a reduced modulatory effect on GVS responses in PCA relative to tAD and control groups. This was evident at the earliest stage of mechanical response, suggesting reduced feedforward visual influences on balance control in PCA. Our findings implicate disrupted occipito-thalamic pathways in PCA-related balance disturbances. The findings reveal a dissociation between perceived uprightness and sensorimotor balance control, with implications for understanding disturbed spatial orientation and balance in dementia.",

        "abstract": "Selaginellae Herba, known as \"Juan Bai\" in traditional Chinese medicine, has been used for centuries to alleviate bleeding disorders and promote blood circulation. Its carbonized form, Selaginellae Herba Carbonisata, is specifically employed to enhance hemostatic effects. The fire-based processing (carbonization) is believed to modify its chemical composition and efficacy, yet the transformations and their impact on sensory and bioactive properties remain poorly understood.\nThis study aimed to comprehensively analyze the chemical changes in Selaginellae Herba during carbonization and correlate them with measurable sensory traits, thereby evaluating whether carbonization preserves or optimizes the herbal properties.\nUntargeted metabolomics using UPLC-QE-Orbitrap-MS/MS and Global Natural Products Social Molecular Networking (GNPS) was applied to compare crude (SH-Cr), properly processed (SH-Ca), Insufficiently processed (ISH-Ca), and Excessively processed (ESH-Ca) samples. Multimodal sensory profiling was conducted using electronic eye (color parameters L*/a*/b*), electronic nose (volatiles), and electronic tongue (taste). Multivariate statistical analyses, including OPLS-DA, were used to identify heat-sensitive markers, and Pearson correlation analysis was employed to link compositional changes with sensory attributes.\nA total of 83 compounds were unequivocally identified (77 by UPLC-QE-Orbitrap-MS/MS & 6 via GNPS), primarily flavonoids and phenolic acids. Key biflavones such as amentoflavone decreased significantly, while aglycones like apigenin increased, indicating glycoside hydrolysis and biflavone cleavage. OPLS-DA identified 31 potential markers (e.g., glutamic acid, VIP = 1.43). Color parameter b* (yellowness) showed a strong negative correlation with biflavones (e.g., robustaflavone, r = -0.932) and a positive correlation with aglycones (e.g., kaempferol, r = 0.866). Volatile profiles and bitterness were also significantly associated with flavonoid transformations (P < 0.05).\nSH-Ca achieved an optimal balance between flavonoid transformation and desirable sensory outcomes, supporting the traditional use of carbonization to enhance the properties of Selaginellae Herba. These findings provide a scientific basis for optimizing processing parameters to ensure quality and efficacy.",

        "abstract": "Vaccination shows effectiveness at personal and community levels. To manage vaccine demand and supply, effectively promote vaccination, and plan future vaccination strategies, it is crucial to understand the change in the population's willingness over time. Extreme changes in vaccination willingness can affect vaccine oversupply and shortage. Few longitudinal studies have focused on vaccination willingness after the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, we sought to explore temporal changes in COVID-19 vaccination willingness and identify associated variables during and after the pandemic.\nA 4-year panel survey was conducted in Japan between January 2020 and March 2024. To evaluate changes in COVID-19 vaccine willingness and identify associated factors, we assessed vaccine hesitancy in September 2022 (i.e., previously vaccinated individuals who did not wish to receive future vaccinations) and unreversed willingness to vaccinate in March 2024 (i.e., previously vaccinated individuals who wished to receive future vaccinations and wished to receive vaccination in September 2022). Modified Poisson regression was performed to examine the predictors of vaccine hesitancy and unreversed willingness to vaccinate.\nVaccination willingness declined from 51.0\u00a0% in September 2022 to 19.9\u00a0% in March 2024. Man, interest in COVID-19, risk perception, age, and agreement with government policies were negatively associated with vaccine hesitancy. Family experience of infection emerged as a borderline-significant negative factor in unreversed willingness to vaccinate.\nPopulations with younger populations, women, and people with low dread risk of perception for COVID-19 may have a low initial vaccination demand, which may decrease even after the pandemic ends. Vaccine demand may change within the same population. Therefore, it is crucial to reassess and adjust distribution strategies based on population characteristics.\nIt is essential to consider these associated factors and adjust the balance between vaccine supply and demand over time to maintain adequate coverage and prevent waste of resources.",

        "abstract": "This randomized controlled trial aimed to compare the effectiveness of two surgical approaches to endoscopic orbital decompression for thyroid-associated ophthalmopathy (TAO). In total, 48 moderate-to-severe or sight-threatening TAO orbits were enrolled and randomly assigned into the transconjunctival group or transnasal group. The main outcome was the rate of effectiveness. If the postoperative proptosis was below 18\u00a0mm or the value of proptosis reduction was over 8\u00a0mm, this was defined as effective. The secondary outcomes included surgical accuracy, best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), ocular motility grade, diplopia grade, and safety. The effective rate was 87.5\u00a0% in the transconjunctival group and 79.2\u00a0% in the transnasal group (p\u00a0=\u00a00.087). The proptosis reduction was 5.38\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.60\u00a0mm in the transconjunctival group and 4.40\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.66\u00a0mm in the transnasal group (p\u00a0=\u00a00.435). A significant difference was found between preoperative and postoperative proptosis in both groups (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01). A higher surgical accuracy in the medial wall was found in the transconjunctival group (p\u00a0=\u00a00.001). There was no significant difference in both groups between preoperative and postoperative BCVA and ocular motility grade. Complications showed no significant difference between the two groups (p\u00a0>\u00a00.05). In conclusion, both transconjunctival and transnasal endoscopic orbital decompression were feasible and could be utilized by surgeons.

Recent research has identified stigma toward the cognitive impairment associated with schizophrenia, highlighting how changes in sense of self and perception interact with cognition to shape daily interactions and functioning. This scoping review sought to provide an overview of the published research linking stigma and cognition in psychotic disorders, in order to identify gaps in knowledge and directions for future research. The review followed PRISMA-ScR guidelines across PubMed, Web of Science, and PsycInfo databases. A total of 32 papers were eligible and reviewed for data extraction including study design, sample characteristics, and main findings reported. A total of 20 papers evaluated relationships between stigma and neurocognition, while 12 focused on social cognition or metacognition as related to stigma. The vast majority of papers (over 80%) focused on internalized stigma as related to cognition. This current literature suggests that subjective cognition, rather than performance-based cognition, is of importance for internalized stigma among people with psychotic disorders. Additional research is needed regarding how other stigma constructs, such as perceived stigma experiences or stigma specific to cognitive difficulties, may be associated with cognition and functional outcomes.",

        "abstract": "Locked entry and exit doors are common on contemporary mental health inpatient units, with previous research suggesting clinicians believe they\u00a0reduce the risks of absconding, prevent the importation of illicit substances, and reduce aggression. However, this focus on reducing risk is at the cost of therapeutic relationships, resulting in mental health consumer perception that mental health units are punitive and create a custodial feel. The aim of this paper is to describe nurses' experiences of using locked doors on mental health inpatient units to prevent consumers absconding. We used a Qualitative Descriptive approach, with semi-structured interviews conducted with 15 Australian mental health nurses. Data were analysed using Braun and Clarke's (2006) method of thematic analysis and reported in accordance with the Consolidated Checklist for Reporting Qualitative Data (CORE-Q guidelines). Three themes emerged during data analysis: (1) Locked doors and absconding: Nurse perceptions, (2) Smoking as a driver of absconding, and (3) Locked in and lashing out: Aggression linked to door locking. Participants in this study expressed that locking doors was necessary to prevent absconding. However, they also felt that door locking was restrictive and detrimental to the therapeutic relationship. There is a need to examine the impact of locked doors on the mental health nursing role, in addition to enhancing nursing skills in risk assessment, shared decision making, and ways to enhance the therapeutic relationship and milieu of the ward.",

        "abstract": "Serial dependencies in perceptual tasks have been suggested to reflect implicit perceptual priors derived from short-term perceptual history. A reduced weighting of perceptual priors has been proposed as a mechanism underlying psychotic experiences such as delusions and hallucinations. Here, we sought to characterize the effects of implicit and explicit perceptual priors on auditory perceptual decision-making and their modulation by psychosis proneness.\nAcross two online experiments, 197 healthy participants completed an auditory two-alternative forced-choice task and standard questionnaires assessing psychosis proneness. In experiment 1, we assessed serial dependence by quantifying the influence of previous on current perceptual choices. Participants revealed a tendency to repeat previous choices, suggesting they formed implicit priors based on recent choice history. The weighting of these implicit priors correlated negatively with psychosis proneness. In experiment 2, we additionally manipulated explicit perceptual priors by providing probabilistic cues before each trial. We found significant effects of both implicit (i.e., choice history) and explicit (i.e., probabilistic cues) prior information, but only the latter correlated negatively with psychosis proneness. In both experiments, reliance on sensory information was increased with higher psychosis proneness. Using hidden Markov models, we found no conclusive evidence for a modulation of temporal dynamics of serial dependencies by psychosis proneness.\nOur findings support the notion of a shift in perceptual inference away from perceptual priors and towards sensory information as a mechanism facilitating psychosis. However, the degree to which different types of perceptual priors are modulated by psychosis proneness seems to depend on experimental context.",

China has initiated three rounds of HPC pilot programs covering two-thirds of its cities, yet public utilization remains low. Understanding public knowledge, attitude, and preference (KAP) toward HPC is essential to overcoming adoption barriers and fostering acceptance.\nTo empirically evaluate public KAP for HPC, pinpoint influencing factors, and offer targeted strategies to address challenges.\nThis cross-sectional study assessed public KAP using the culturally adapted Public Knowledge, Attitude, and Preference of HPC Scale (P-KAPHPCs). Regression analysis was applied to identify factors associated with KAP. A structural equation model was constructed to test their interrelationship.\nAmong all the respondents, the mean score for HPC knowledge was 7.47\u2009\u00b1\u20092.14, with 41.10% of the respondents could explain HPC. Educational level and household income were associated factors of knowledge (p\u2009<\u20090.05). The overall attitude mean score rate was 84.18%.

Structural equation modeling analysis showed that knowledge was positively associated with attitude (\u03b2\u2009=\u20094.97, p\u2009<\u20090.001) and knowledge was positively associated with preference (\u03b2\u2009=\u20090.22, p\u2009<\u20090.001).\nThe public attitude toward HPC is generally positive, though there is a need to improve the quality of public knowledge, and preference varies. Knowledge has a positive influence on both attitude and preference. Traditional cultural values and ethics sometimes create conflicts in HPC decision-making. Therefore, it is recommended to strengthen HPC education, enhance legal protections for advance care planning (ACP) and advance directives (AD), introduce culturally appropriate family consensus communication tools, and establish a home-community hybrid care model.",

        "abstract": "Insomnia disorder with depressive symptoms (IDDS) represents a significant clinical phenotype, with a bidirectional relationship where insomnia both contributes to and results from depression. This study aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of combining zolpidem with Shugan Jieyu in treating IDDS.\nIn a double-blind, randomized trial, 60 IDDS patients were assigned to zolpidem plus Shugan Jieyu (ZS) or zolpidem plus placebo (ZP) for 8 weeks, with 59 completing the study. Assessments included the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7 (GAD-7), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), polysomnography (PSG), and sleep diary. Mixed-model repeated-measures (MMRM) analysis was performed to assess the least squares means difference (LSMD) among the groups after 4 and 8 weeks of treatment. Subgroup analysis was performed on patients with sleep fragmentation (WASO\u2009\u2265\u200930\u00a0min).\nBoth groups showed significant improvements in ISI, PSQI, ESS, GAD-7, and PHQ-9, with no between-group differences. For the primary outcome (ISI), the between-group difference at week 8 was -\u20091.68 points (95% CI: -4.49 to 1.14; p\u2009=\u20090.238), corresponding to a small effect size (Cohen's d\u2009=\u20090.42). ZS significantly reduced WASO and increased TST at 8 weeks, whereas ZP showed no significant changes in these measures within the group. ZS reduced subjective sleep latency (sSL) significantly more than ZP at weeks 4 (LSMD -\u200912.21\u00a0min, 95% CI -22.54 to -1.87; p\u2009=\u20090.021; d\u2009=\u20090.23) and 8 (LSMD -\u200912.17\u00a0min, 95% CI -21.99 to -2.35; p\u2009=\u20090.016; d\u2009=\u20090.25). In the sleep fragmentation subgroup, ZS improved sSL and subjective sleep efficiency (sSE). Both treatments were well-tolerated.\nCompared with taking zolpidem alone, the combination of zolpidem with Shugan Jieyu did not significantly improve insomnia, but showed preliminary non-objective signals in improving patients' perception of falling asleep, particularly in patients with sleep fragmentation.\nThe study is registered in the ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT05764798).

Yet it is unclear whether social competence may explain differences in attention allocation to emotional faces in anxiety disorders. This study used eye-tracking to assess gaze patterns in 57 females aged 15 to 24 who viewed emotional faces (angry and neutral) on a screen. It explored whether latency to first fixation and dwell time on emotional faces (female and male) are dependent on anxiety symptoms and social competence, and if social competence accounts for the association of anxiety with attention allocation. With increasing anxiety symptoms, participants' dwell time on neutral compared to angry female faces increased, yet no effects were observed for male faces. Similarly, with decreasing social competence, participants' dwell time on neutral compared to angry female faces increased, yet no differences were observed for male faces. Contrary to the hypothesis, social competence did not account for the effects of anxiety on attention allocation. No effects were observed for latency to first fixation. Anxiety and social competence are both independently associated with attentional biases toward facial expressions in female participants. Yet, these associations seemed to depend on the gender of the face seen.",

        "abstract": "Many copy number variants (CNVs) are implicated in neurodevelopmental disability, but exhibit incomplete penetrance. The definition of penetrance is often unclear. In published literature, penetrance typically includes the background risk of disease, while clinicians tend to exclude risks unrelated to the genetic variant. We propose a more clinically relevant definition of penetrance and develop a new formula for this. These changes are applied to existing data sources to produce updated penetrance estimates. Our findings indicate that most CNVs studied have significantly lower penetrance than previously published. Eleven CNVs, previously described as low-penetrant, are recalculated as having a penetrance close to 0% for intellectual disability. These include 1q21.1 proximal duplications [RBM8A], 2q11.2 deletions [TMEM127], 2q13 proximal deletions and duplications [NPHP1], 6q16 duplications [SIM1], 13q12 deletions [CRYL1], 15q11.2 duplications [NIPA1, NIPA2], 15q13.3 duplications [CHRNA7], 16p12.2 duplications [CDR2], 16p13.11 duplications [MYH11] and Xp22.3 duplications [SHOX]. Previous estimates of CNV penetrance, which ranged from 10-40% have been recalculated as 1-10%. In conclusion, many previously published estimates of CNV penetrance are inflated. Re-evaluation of existing data reveals lower and more accurate penetrance estimates for intellectual disability. This has important implications for diagnosis, genetic counselling, and prenatal reporting of recurrent CNVs.",

ASD showed the strongest association, followed by ADHD related traits, motor difficulties, intellectual disability, Tourette's/tics, and learning difficulties. Factor analysis identified three latent dimensions: (1) Social Communication & Language, (2) Learning & Cognitive Processing, and (3) Attention & Motor Regulation - each of which was statistically significantly associated with SOR.\nSOR is a prevalent and clinically significant transdiagnostic feature that cuts across multiple neurodevelopmental domains. Our findings support the conceptualization of SOR as a modality-specific liability factor nested within the proposed neurodevelopmental spectrum of the Hierarchical Taxonomy of Psychopathology (HiTOP) framework.

        "abstract": "Parents are uniquely placed to support their child's development. Interventions which are designed to be delivered by parents therefore hold considerable promise, particularly for children with neurodevelopmental conditions that are associated with particular developmental strengths and challenges.\nThis study worked in partnership with families from the Down syndrome community to adapt an evidence-based early language intervention for children with Down syndrome.\nSix families with a 3- to 5-year-old child with Down syndrome participated in this mixed-methods exploratory study. Guided by aspects of Community-Based Participatory Research and Design-Based Research, iterative cycles of design, implementation, analysis, and re-design were implemented to produce an adapted intervention programme. Data were collected using record forms, surveys, observations, and focus groups.\nFindings showed many aspects of the original programme were acceptable and feasible for families, but important adaptations were identified, including enhancing repetition and consolidation, reducing time pressures, tailoring to individual needs, smaller steps for learning, supporting engagement, and increasing visual support. Adapting the programme in these ways enhanced adherence, enjoyment and the child's active engagement.\nThis study is the first to report the process of adapting an existing language intervention for people with disabilities and highlights the value of working with families to identify the best ways to support their needs. Our approach shows promise for supporting language development in this population and serves as a foundation for future research that aims to develop novel interventions.\nWhat is already known on the subject Speech and language difficulties are well-documented in individuals with Down syndrome, and may benefit from intervention to enable individuals to reach their full potential. Parent-delivered models of intervention hold promise for supporting oral language skills, but very few evidence-based interventions exist for this population. What this paper adds to the existing knowledge Parents of young children with Down syndrome are able to deliver early language intervention in ways which encourage their child's active involvement and enjoyment. Parents identified a range of ways in which early language intervention could be adapted to support implementation and effectiveness. What are the potential or actual clinical implications for this work? Parents are important partners in early language intervention for children with Down syndrome, with much to contribute to the design and delivery of intervention. Findings from this study will guide researchers and clinicians in the process of adapting interventions for this population, with the aim of improving outcomes for children and their families.",

        "abstract": "Different types of germline de novo SETBP1 variants cause clinically distinct and heterogeneous neurodevelopmental disorders: Schinzel-Giedion syndrome (SGS, via missense variants at a critical degron region) and SETBP1-haploinsufficiency disorder. However, due to the lack of systematic investigation of genotype-phenotype associations of different types of SETBP1 variants, and limited understanding of its roles in neurodevelopment, the extent of clinical heterogeneity and how this relates to underlying pathophysiological mechanisms remains elusive. This imposes challenges for diagnosis. Here, we present a comprehensive investigation of the largest cohort to date of individuals carrying SETBP1 missense variants outside the degron region (n\u2009=\u200918). We performed thorough clinical and speech phenotyping with functional follow-up using cellular assays and transcriptomics. Our findings suggest that such variants cause a clinically and functionally variable developmental syndrome, showing only partial overlaps with classical SGS and SETBP1-haploinsufficiency disorder. We provide evidence of loss-of-function pathophysiological mechanisms impairing ubiquitination, DNA-binding, transcription, and neuronal differentiation capacity and morphologies. In contrast to SGS and SETBP1 haploinsufficiency, these effects are independent of protein abundance. Overall, our study provides important novel insights into diagnosis, patient care, and aetiology of SETBP1-related disorders.",

This population-based retrospective birth cohort study linked provincial administrative health data of M\u00e9tis and non-M\u00e9tis singleton live births (2006-2016) to follow them up to 10 years of age. A random 1:4 sample of non-M\u00e9tis children served as a reference group. Neurodevelopmental disorders and disabilities (NDD/D) were examined across six functional NDD/D domains. Prevalence odds ratios (pOR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated using logistic regression models, adjusted for maternal and neonatal characteristics. Incidence rates (IR) per 1,000 person-years were estimated, and age-specific IR was modeled using longitudinal Poisson regression, adjusting for covariates. Associations between maternal and neonatal characteristics and NDD/D incidence among M\u00e9tis children were examined using multivariable longitudinal Poisson regression models, with adjusted incidence rate ratios (IRR) and 95% CI reported. A total of 38,958 singleton live births were included (7,853 M\u00e9tis and 31,105 non-M\u00e9tis). Overall NDD/D prevalence among M\u00e9tis (3.3%) and non-M\u00e9tis (2.8%) children did not differ significantly after adjustment (adjusted pOR: 1.1, 95% CI: 0.9, 1.3). Learning-cognition was the most prevalent NDD/D domain. M\u00e9tis children had a higher IR of NDD/D at age 2 (5.5 vs. 2.8 cases per 1,000 person-years, rate difference: 2.7 [95% CI: 0.8, 4.6]). Among M\u00e9tis children, higher NDD/D incidence was associated with maternal age younger than 20 or older than 35 years, high pre-pregnancy weight, male sex, preterm birth, and congenital anomalies. While overall NDD/D prevalence was similar between M\u00e9tis and non-M\u00e9tis children, M\u00e9tis children were more likely to be diagnosed at age 2, suggesting potential differences in early diagnosis, access to care, or underlying risk factors. A functional classification approach of neurodevelopmental health supports culturally responsive early screening and intervention strategies to address these differences.",

        "abstract": "Rapidly increasing evidence has documented that endocrine disruptors (EDs) contribute substantially to disease and disability, particularly neurodevelopmental disorders, metabolic diseases, reproductive disorders, immune and thyroid dysfunctions, as well as hormone-related cancers. These conditions can lead to chronic impairments and disability, such as learning and behavioral difficulties, infertility, long-term treatment dependence, or reduced functional capacity. Biomonitoring studies conducted in France have shown widespread exposure of the general population to several endocrine disruptors (phthalates, bisphenols, pesticides, PCBs, etc.), with particularly high levels observed among children. However, there is still too little epidemiological surveillance data. To address this gap, Sant\u00e9 publique France has undertaken a project to prioritize the health effects to be surveilled in relation to EDs, considering both scientific and societal criteria. Scientific criteria included the strength of evidence for ED-related causality, severity of health outcomes, and data availability. Societal criteria considered public concern, perceived vulnerability, and relevance to policymaking.\nWe conducted a consultation with experts and French stakeholders in the field of EDs using the Delphi consensus method from November 2021 to June 2022. A list of 59 health effects was submitted for prioritization.\nSeveral effects were prioritized by all the participants according to scientific, epidemiological and societal criteria, including certain effects on neurodevelopment in children (attention deficit disorder with or without hyperactivity, autism spectrum disorder), the metabolic system (e.g. overweight and obesity) and reproductive health (e.g. endometriosis, breast cancer, alteration in sperm quality, etc.).\nBased on the results of this consultation, Sante publique France will develop an integrated ED-related health surveillance strategy to identify and prioritize effective prevention strategies and actions in a context of uncertainty and lack of knowledge.",

Sleep disturbances are highly prevalent among individuals with neurodevelopmental disorders; however, sleep characteristics and patterns in those with Specific Learning Disorders (SLDs) have been largely overlooked, and a comprehensive systematically synthesis lacks. This systematic review and meta-analysis (PROSPERO ID: CRD42021257350) aims to assess differences in sleep characteristics between individuals with SLDs and controls or individuals with neurodevelopmental disorders other than SLDs. Multiple search strategies identified a total of 13 independent studies, including case-control and cross-sectional designs, with a total sample of 695 children and adolescents and 55 adults with SLDs, and 7459 children and adolescents and 55 adults without SLDs. The risk of bias was evaluated using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale for Assessing the Quality of Nonrandomized Studies in Meta-Analysis. Findings were synthesized narratively and through meta-analysis for both Objective and Subjective sleep outcomes. Meta-analyses of several Objective sleep macroarchitecture parameters showed no difference between groups. Conversely, children and adolescents with SLDs exhibited a significantly higher prevalence of sleep disturbances measured as Subjective outcomes compared to controls without SLDs.

Systematic reviews, meta-analyses, and international consensus statements addressing attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism spectrum disorder (ASD), specific learning disorders, communication and language disorders, intellectual disability, and developmental coordination disorder were included.\nInterest in interventions such as neurofeedback, transcranial direct current stimulation, music therapy, equine-assisted therapy, virtual reality, and gamification has grown substantially. However, most of these approaches lack methodological standardization and robust evidence to justify their use as primary treatments. Some demonstrate modest benefits as adjunctive strategies, especially when integrated into structured programs and supervised by multidisciplinary teams. Conversely, therapies including acupuncture, ozone therapy, and hyperbaric oxygen therapy present insufficient scientific support and should not be considered substitutes for validated methods.\nComplementary and alternative therapies remain a topic of significant debate in the management of neurodevelopmental disorders. While certain approaches may offer limited adjunctive benefits, their clinical use should be carefully evaluated within evidence-based frameworks. The development of rigorous evaluations, standardized protocols, and the safe integration of innovative technologies is essential to optimize therapeutic outcomes without compromising access to scientifically validated interventions.",

FASD is a neurodevelopmental disability caused by prenatal alcohol exposure resulting in lifelong disabilities impacting children, families, kinship caregivers, foster carers, and communities.\nThis Aboriginal led research was underpinned by Indigenous methodology utilising a developed culturally appropriate survey tool completed by 180 Aboriginal people in WA. Questions included the history of colonisation in Australia. Quantitative analysis of the survey results was undertaken.\nIt was identified by 92% of respondents that they felt it was important to know about FASD and low awareness of FASD exists, and only 20% had received information on FASD. Participants wanted to receive more information on FASD and culturally preferred approaches to training included small groups, community forums, or one to one learning. The majority of participants identified that they had experienced the removal of an immediate member of their family or themselves, or were a member of the Stolen Generations.\nThe results highlight that awareness, knowledge, and education can contribute to the prevention of FASD and support effective interventions on country and in the community.

We performed a Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis using summary data from global genome-wide association studies to investigate the potential causal relationship between leisure screen time (LST) and NDDs risk.\nOur dataset comprised 703,901 participants of European ancestry from 51 studies, with 256,725 individuals in the LST-valid sample. We investigated causal associations with six types of NDDs using five MR methods: inverse-variance weighted (IVW), MR Egger, weighted median, simple mode, and weighted mode. IVW was the primary method due to its efficiency and precision. Heterogeneity and horizontal pleiotropy were assessed using IVW and MR Egger, while the other methods served as sensitivity analyses to confirm robustness.\nThe IVW method revealed that each standard deviation increase in LST was associated with a reduced risk of ADHD (OR = 0.68; 95% CI: 0.52-0.89) and an elevated risk of intellectual disability (OR = 1.66; 95% CI: 1.26-2.18). These associations were consistent with the weighted median analysis (ADHD: OR = 0.68; 95% CI: 0.47-0.98; intellectual disability: OR = 1.51; 95% CI: 1.06-2.14).\nOur findings suggest that genetic predisposition to increased LST is causally associated with a lower risk of ADHD but a higher risk of intellectual disability, with no evidence for a causal relatawdionship with the other four NDDs.

The electroencephalogram (EEG) serves as a non-invasive tool to explore brain function in KS; yet, systematic characterizations of EEG features remain extremely limited. This review synthesizes current evidence on EEG findings in KS, highlighting the high prevalence of nonspecific abnormalities and seizures, but the absence of a consistent electrophysiological biomarker. Given the growing role of machine learning (ML) in extracting patterns from EEG data in related disorders-such as Angelman, Rett and Fragile X syndromes-this review explores how similar approaches could be adapted for KS. Despite promising perspectives, a lack of large-scale, publicly available EEG datasets hinders the application of ML methodologies in KS research. Future directions are proposed to address these gaps, including standardized EEG data collection, adoption of quantitative EEG analyses and integration of ML techniques adapted for small datasets. This multidisciplinary strategy holds potential for improving early diagnosis, monitoring and personalized interventions in Kleefstra syndrome.",

        "abstract": "Individuals with Turner syndrome (TS) are known to be at increased risk for neurodevelopmental disorders (NDD) and mental health (MH) conditions, but data from large, population-based pediatric samples remain limited. We examined the prevalence of NDD and MH diagnoses among youth with TS (N\u2009=\u20092145) compared to matched female controls (N\u2009=\u20098580) across six US pediatric health systems. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated using generalized estimating equations. Youth with TS had significantly higher odds of an NDD diagnosis (24.2% vs. 11.9%; OR 2.37, 95% CI 2.11-2.67), particularly for speech-language, motor, learning, and attentional disorders. Increased odds were also observed for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and intellectual developmental disorder (IDD), though these remained relatively uncommon. In contrast, MH diagnoses, such as anxiety and mood disorders, were not more prevalent in TS compared to controls (17.3% vs. 18.5%; OR 0.92, 95% CI 0.81-1.05). These findings support the need for proactive neurodevelopmental screening in TS and raise important questions about the recognition and documentation of MH conditions in this population. Additional research is warranted to understand whether MH symptoms are underdiagnosed, present differently, or emerge later in development in youth with TS.",

        "doi": "10.1162/IMAG.a.144",
        "abstract": "Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by differences in social communication and repetitive behaviors. Our laboratory has previously found that g-ratio, the proportion of axon width to myelin diameter, and axonal conduction velocity, which is associated with the capacity of an axon to carry information, are both decreased throughout the adolescent brain in ASD. By associating these differences with performance on cognitive and behavioral tests, this study aims to first associate a broad array of behavioral metrics with neuroimaging markers of ASD, and to explore the prevalence of ASD subtypes using a neuroimaging driven perspective. Analyzing 273 participants (148 with ASD) ages 8 to 17 years through an NIH-sponsored Autism Centers of Excellence network (MH100028), we observe widespread associations between behavioral and cognitive evaluations of autism and between behavioral and microstructural metrics, alongside different directional correlations between different behavioral metrics. Stronger associations with individual subcategories from each test rather than summary scores suggest that different neuronal profiles may be masked by composite test scores. Machine learning cluster analyses applied to neuroimaging data reinforce the association between neuroimaging and behavioral metrics and suggest that age-related maturation of brain metrics may drive changes in ASD behavior. This suggests that if ASD can be definitively subtyped, these subtypes may show different behavioral trajectories across the developmental period. Clustering identified a pattern of restrictive and repetitive behavior in some participants and a second group that was defined by high sensory sensitivity and language performance.",

        "abstract": "Introduction Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI) is a rare condition caused by renal resistance to the action of antidiuretic hormone (ADH) at the level of the distal tubule, resulting in impaired urinary concentration and consequent polyuria. NDI may be hereditary, most commonly X-linked due to AVPR2 gene mutations, or acquired. Objective To characterize the clinical features, management strategies, and outcomes of patients with NDI followed at a tertiary pediatric nephrology center. Methods A retrospective observational study was conducted, including pediatric patients diagnosed with NDI between 1991 and 2024. Data regarding clinical presentation, diagnostic approach, management strategies, and long-term outcomes were collected and analyzed. Results Eight patients (including one set of twins) were identified; seven (87.5%) were male subjects. The median age at diagnosis was 7.5 months (interquartile range (IQR): 6.0-9.0). All patients presented with polydipsia, polyuria (median diuresis: 10.0 (IQR: 9.0-10.2) mL/kg/h), and failure to thrive. Constipation and recurrent fever were observed in two patients (25.0%). At diagnosis, the median serum sodium level was 160.5 mmol/L (IQR: 139-168), and the urine/plasma osmolality ratio was 0.41 (IQR: 0.26-0.49). No patients exhibited metabolic acidosis. All desmopressin tests were negative. Genetic testing was performed in four patients, all of whom had pathogenic X-linked AVPR2 variants. All patients were treated with hydrochlorothiazide and amiloride; indomethacin was added in 5 (62.5%). Serum sodium normalized in all cases. Over a median follow-up period of 16.9 years (IQR: 8.4-17.4), growth improved, but all patients continued to exhibit polyuria and polydipsia. Neurodevelopmental disorders were identified in six patients, including intellectual disability, autism spectrum disorder, language delay, and learning difficulties. Renal function, serum sodium, and imaging findings remained stable throughout follow-up. At the final assessment, all patients remained on hydrochlorothiazide and amiloride. Five transitioned to adult nephrology at a median age of 17.0 years (IQR: 16.0-17.0). Conclusion Although rare, NDI can significantly impact growth and neurodevelopment. The diagnosis should be considered in infants with failure to thrive, especially when accompanied by polyuria and polydipsia. Early recognition and intervention, even if non-specific, may improve long-term outcomes.",

        "abstract": "Social media is increasingly used in many contexts within the healthcare sector. The improved prevalence of Internet use via computers or mobile devices presents an opportunity for social media to serve as a tool for the rapid and direct distribution of essential health information. Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are a comprehensive neurodevelopmental syndrome with enduring effects. Twitter has become a platform for the ASD community, offering substantial assistance to its members by disseminating information on their beliefs and perspectives via language and emotional expression. Adults with ASD have considerable social and emotional challenges, while also demonstrating abilities and interests in screen-based technologies.\nThe novelty of this research lies in its use in the context of Twitter to analyze and identify ASD. This research used Twitter as the primary data source to examine the behavioral traits and immediate emotional expressions of persons with ASD. We applied Convolutional Neural Networks with Long Short-Term Memory (CNN-LSTM), LSTM, and Double Deep Q-network (DDQN-Inspired) using a standardized dataset including 172 tweets from the ASD class and 158 tweets from the non-ASD class. The dataset was processed to exclude lowercase text and special characters, followed by a tokenization approach to convert the text into integer word sequences. The encoding was used to transform the classes into binary labels. Following preprocessing, the proposed framework was implemented to identify ASD.\nThe findings of the DDQN-inspired model demonstrate a high precision of 87% compared to the proposed model. This finding demonstrates the potential of the proposed approach for identifying ASD based on social media content.\nUltimately, the proposed system was compared against the existing system that used the same dataset. The proposed approach is based on variations in the text of social media interactions, which can assist physicians and clinicians in performing symptom studies within digital footprint environments.",

        "abstract": "Bainbridge-Ropers syndrome (BRPS) is a rare neurodevelopmental disorder caused by variants in the ASXL3 gene. Nearly all cases are de novo, representing widely varying ASXL3 genotypes. Commonly observed traits include feeding difficulties, global motor delays, hypotonia, intellectual disability, autism, seizures, and craniofacial and skeletal changes. Difficulty with verbal communication is present in all cases, yet speech and language characteristics have not been described closely. Here, we present two brothers with BRPS due to suspected parental germline mosaicism. Clinical histories were based on chart review, interviews with a parent, and direct observations. Despite identical genotypes, phenotypic expression varies in severity. Both children have developmental coordination disorder, consistent with cerebellar dysfunction. Child 1, age 11\u2009years, has childhood apraxia of speech (CAS) and largely intact cognitive skills. He received specialized therapy focused on motor learning and communicates verbally. Child 2, age 8, has oral apraxia, intellectual disability, autism, and language disorder. He communicates using non-speaking means. Bioinformatic analyses show that ASXL3 belongs to a regulatory network with highest cerebellar expression up to postconception Week 24. This study contributes speech and language descriptions, illustrates phenotypic variability likely resulting from the transcriptional regulatory network interacting with environmental influences, and underscores the importance of therapies that take motor discoordination into account.",

        "abstract": "SKOR2 is a transcriptional repressor expressed in central nervous system tissues, mainly in the Purkinje cells (PCs). This is essential for the proper migration, development, and differentiation of PCs at embryonic stages, and its disruption can affect cerebellar function. SKOR2 protein has two DHD and SAND domains, which play an important role in the TGF-\u03b2 signaling pathway by binding to Smad transcriptional regulators. Herein, we report nine patients from two unrelated Iranian families suffering from a distinctive combination of learning disability, facial dysmorphisms, and motor and speech impairments. Whole exome sequencing (WES) was employed to identify pathogenic variants in the probands. Sanger sequencing was conducted to confirm the mutations found in the patients, their healthy parents, and relatives. A range of bioinformatics tools was utilized to assess the impact of the identified mutations on the function and structure of the related proteins. WES identified two novel missense (c.374\u2009G\u2009>\u2009C: p.Arg125Pro) and frameshift (c.1271_1274del: p.K424Rfs*71) mutations in exon 2 of the SKOR2 gene. After segregation and in-silico studies, autosomal recessive inheritance and pathogenic nature of the identified mutation were confirmed. In addition, the studied patients had distinct phenotypes such as clumsiness, dysarthria, and severe hypotonia compared to previous studies, which we named Skor2-related syndrome. These findings indicated a novel SKOR2-related syndrome characterized by neurodevelopmental delay and ataxia. Our findings, given the limited previous studies on the SKOR2 gene, expanded the pathogenic mutations and phenotypic spectrum of SKOR2-associated disorders, provided criteria facilitating early diagnosis and supported genetic counseling for prognosis and family planning.",

        "abstract": "Argyrophilic grain disease is an age-related disorder characterized by the presence of argyrophilic grains. Argyrophilic grain disease has a sequential distribution pattern that begins in the ambient gyrus (Saito Stage I), spreads to the medial temporal lobe (Saito Stage II) and reaches the basal forebrain and cingulate gyrus (Saito Stage III). A strong association with cognitive decline, especially in cases of Saito Stage III argyrophilic grain disease, has also been reported. The main clinical feature includes cognitive decline characterized by memory disturbance, although conflicting results have been reported. Recent studies suggest an association with parkinsonism. To clarify the association between argyrophilic grain disease, cognitive decline and parkinsonism, we performed a clinicopathological study using the Brain Bank for Aging Research autopsy cohort in Japan. Approximately half (227) of the 452 consecutive autopsy cases had argyrophilic grain disease, and the frequency and stage of argyrophilic grain disease increased with age. Among the argyrophilic grain disease cases, 20 were demented without any comorbid pathology responsible for it, a condition referred to as dementia with grains. Furthermore, 6 of the 20 dementia with grains cases presented with parkinsonism, particularly postural instability, in addition to memory disturbance. Dementia with grains cases with parkinsonism had significantly more argyrophilic grains in the substantia nigra than those without parkinsonism and showed significantly decreased anti-dopamine transporter immunoreactivity in the putamen compared to control cases. Given these findings, argyrophilic grain disease is strongly associated with cognitive decline, especially in Saito Stage III cases, and parkinsonism is a new common clinical presentation. The extension of argyrophilic grain disease pathology to the nigrostriatal system may contribute to the development of parkinsonism.",

        "abstract": "Antidepressants are commonly prescribed for treating anxiety disorders and depression, including pregnant patients. These medications influence the absorption and metabolism of key neurotransmitters such as serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine. However, many aspects of antidepressant function remain unclear, especially regarding their impact on neurodevelopment when used during pregnancy. To explore this, we employed a 3R-friendly chicken embryo model to investigate the cellular and molecular implications of antidepressants use. We focused on commonly used antidepressants for the study: escitalopram, which is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor; and venlafaxine, a serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor, both of which are frequently prescribed during pregnancy. Drug distribution analysis showed that both antidepressant drugs reached clinical concentrations in the brain of developing chicken embryos and persisted for several hours. High-throughput miRNA-sequencing showed that venlafaxine upregulated 13 different miRNAs in the chicken cerebellum. Specifically, miR-92 and its human ortholog, miR-363, were significantly upregulated in chicken cerebellum and neuronally differentiated human SH-SY5Y cells, respectively. Neurite metrics showed a significant reduction in neurite outgrowth with venlafaxine, but not with escitalopram. Furthermore, venlafaxine caused histological alterations, such as increased white matter and reduced thickness of the cortical and molecular layer in the cerebellum. Both drugs reduced the thickness of the external granular layer and the number of mitotic events, impacting this crucial germinal zone of the brain. These findings highlight distinct neurodevelopmental effects of escitalopram and venlafaxine and raise awareness for potential adverse neurological effects in offspring exposed to antidepressants in utero.",

Antipsychotics, along with their effectiveness in treatment, have also been associated with a number of adverse effects. One of these is hyperprolactinaemia (hyperPRL) that occurs with antipsychotics. This situation is thought to be due to dopamine blockade in the tuberoinfundibular pathway, which has an effect on prolactin release. Hereby, we present a 15\u2009year old female adolescent bipolar disorder type 1 case who developed hyperprolactinaemia with risperidone treatment which was ameliorated with metformin use (850-2000\u2009mg/day). Although there are studies showing that metformin can be used in the treatment of hyperprolactinaemia, as far as we know, there are not enough studies on the use of metformin in adolescents. Future studies are needed to elucidate the risk factors, aetiological mechanism and treatment alternatives of this adverse effect, which occurs due to antipsychotics and may negatively affect medication compliance.",

        "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by two neurobiological markers: pathological \u03b1-synuclein and/or a dopaminergic deficit. Depression is common in PD, and may precede motor signs, particularly in late-onset depression (LOD). We conducted two systematic reviews and a meta-analysis to examine the relationship between depression and PD development. First, we evaluated whether depression is associated with an increased risk of developing PD, and whether pathological \u03b1-synuclein or dopaminergic deficits were observed in depressed patients prior to PD diagnosis. Second, we evaluated whether studies examined neurobiological markers in LOD patients, regardless of subsequent PD development. Our first review identified 39 studies showing a positive association between depression and subsequent PD. This was supported by an exploratory meta-analysis, stratified by index condition: 1) retrospective studies of patients with PD reporting prior depression (odds ratio [OR] = 2.17, 95% CI: 1.92-2.46) and 2) prospective studies of depressed patients who developed PD (OR = 2.01, 95% CI: 1.20-3.38). Importantly, none of these studies examined neurobiological data. Our second review identified three cross-sectional studies reporting that 24%-79% of the LOD patients had a dopaminergic deficit as detected by dopamine transporter (DAT) imaging. We found no studies in LOD in which \u03b1-synuclein was determined. Given the observed moderately elevated risk for developing PD in depressed patients, the high incidence of abnormal DAT scans in LOD, and ageing as a major risk factor for developing PD, longitudinal studies in LOD patients are essential to establish neurobiological evidence that depression can be an early manifestation of an \u03b1-synucleinopathy like PD.",

        "abstract": "Emerging evidence suggests a link between the oral microbiome and autism spectrum disorder (ASD), a neurodevelopmental condition characterised by social and behavioural impairments. The vast microbial reservoirs in the gut complement those of the oral cavity, suggesting a potential oral-gut-brain axis that may influence ASD and perhaps other neurological diseases, such as Parkinson's syndrome and Alzheimer's disease. For the first time, this systematic review synthesises the current knowledge of oral microbiome composition, diversity, and functionality in ASD and its potential diagnostic and therapeutic implications.\nA comprehensive literature search was conducted using Medline (PubMed), Embase, Scopus, and Google Scholar for peer-reviewed case-control and cross-sectional studies published between January 2000 and January 2025. Study quality was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa scale.\nNine studies (n = 8533; 2536 ASD and 5937 controls) met the inclusion criteria. The overall findings on microbial diversity were inconsistent; some studies reported alterations in ASD, while others found no significant differences. Functional profiling revealed enrichment of pathways involved in dopamine and GABA degradation, as well as disruptions in lysine metabolism, suggesting possible links to neurotransmitter imbalances in ASD. Although external factors such as selective eating, oral hygiene, and cognitive function were proposed to influence microbial profiles, statistical evidence supporting these associations was lacking. Moreover, no consistent link was found between oral microbiota features and core ASD symptoms like repetitive behaviours or communication deficits.\nThis review highlights subtle yet potentially significant alterations in the oral microbiome of individuals with ASD, particularly in metabolic pathways that affect neurotransmitters. While direct associations with clinical symptoms remain unsubstantiated, the findings emphasise the importance of future multi-omics and longitudinal studies to clarify the oral microbiome's role in ASD pathophysiology and to explore its potential in personalised therapeutic strategies.",

In this review, we aimed to examine scientific evidence on the potential role of T. gondii infection in the development of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), a heterogeneous neurodevelopmental disorder. This review summarizes the current literature exploring the possible association between T. gondii and ASD. Findings indicate that toxoplasmosis may contribute to host alterations, including the induction of humoral and cellular immune responses, production of various cytokines, and changes in neurotransmitter levels (e.g., serotonin, dopamine, acetylcholine, gamma-aminobutyric acid, and glutamate), as well as the activation of enzymes such as indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase, which may influence the pathophysiology of ASD. In conclusion, this review suggests that T. gondii infection could act as a potential risk factor for ASD. However, further intensive studies are necessary to clarify the role of this parasite in the etiology and progression of ASD. This review is anticipated to stimulate further studies aimed at understanding and potentially reducing the burden of neurodevelopmental disorders worldwide.",

We focused primarily on SLC6A3 associated mechanisms and aimed to delineate genotype-phenotype correlations in our cases.\nFrom January 2021 to July 2023, 13 children with MRI-confirmed CCAs underwent chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA) for CNV detection. We performed bioinformatic analyses (Gene Ontology, STRING network) to identify neurodevelopmental genes within pathogenic CNVs, and clinical follow up assessed neurobehavioral outcomes.\nWe identified pathogenic CNVs in 3/13 cases (23.08%). Specifically, Case 8 harbored a 43.05-Mb duplication (5p15.33p12) encompassing SLC6A3, a dopamine transporter gene linked to synaptic signaling. Interaction network analysis suggested that SLC6A3 was the most interconnected gene, providing evidence of its role in CCAs. Clinically, 84.6% of cases (11/13) exhibited psychomotor delay, while 15.4% of cases (2/13) developed seizure. Notably, we observed hearing impairment and psychomotor developmental delay in Case 8 with a SLC6A3 duplication, further suggesting dopaminergic dysregulation in callosal connectivity.\nOur study suggests that SLC6A3 may represent a potential contributor to neurodevelopmental impairments in CCAs. Further, CMA-based CNV screening is critical for early intervention in high-risk children. These findings bridge genetic etiology with clinical phenotypes and offer insights into future targeted therapeutic strategies.",

These increases were prevented in males in both frontal cortex and striatum by prior developmental FeS exposures. In females, developmental Fe exposure was associated with residual increases particularly in striatal serotonergic function and levels of homocysteine independently of behavioral experience.\nCollectively, these findings show the ability of behavioral experience to unmask later life residual consequences of developmental exposures to FeS in males and of latent emerging effects of Fe in females. The collective findings may have relevance to later life neurodegenerative diseases and disorders now increasingly associated with air pollution exposures, and also underscore how understanding how various components of air pollution influence brain is critical to regulatory decisions for public health protection.",

        "abstract": "Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a heterogeneous neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by reduced social interactions, as well as repetitive behaviors and restricted interests. Mutations in SHANK3, a scaffolding protein located postsynaptically at excitatory synapses, are associated with ASD, schizophrenia, and intellectual disability in humans. Similar autism-like phenotypes have been observed in Shank3-deficient rodent models. The mesolimbic dopamine pathway appears to be particularly sensitive to Shank3 disruptions. We have previously shown that Shank3 downregulation in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) (Shank3-NAcKD) during early postnatal development impaired social preference in the three-chamber test. Here, we aimed to assess whether this Shank3 downregulation would lead to deficits in social conditioning paradigms. Specifically, using the social instrumental task (SIT), we found that Shank3-NAcKD male mice performed fewer lever presses to gain access to social interaction with a nonfamiliar juvenile mouse. Moreover, these mice failed to develop a preference for the chamber associated with social stimuli in a conditioned place preference (CPP) task. Unsupervised analysis of locomotor motifs during CPP revealed distinct exploratory strategies, with an altered allocation of exploratory behaviors between the socially paired and unpaired chambers, suggesting a suboptimal direction of exploration towards relevant social-associated cues. Our current data expand on our previous research to understand the involvement of mesolimbic Shank3 expression in autism-like phenotypes. Additionally, our results underline that local Shank3 manipulation during early postnatal life leads to intricate social behavior deficits, highlighting the need for an in-depth dissection of behavioral phenotypes in rodent models of ASD.",

There are several leading theories on schizophrenia etilology, including genetic, neurotransmitter (dopamine and GABA-glutamate are the leading ones), immunological (microglial, cytokine, kynurenine) and neurodevelopmental (neuro-ontogenetic and neurodegenerative) theories. Despite the fact that in recent decades, the greatest efforts have been directed towards testing and developing genetic and neurotransmitter (including dopamine) theories, the recent evidence suggests that immunological aspects, in particular neuroinflammation (cytokine hypothesis) may play an important role in schizophrenia. Neuroinflammation in schizophrenia is thought to be mediated primarily by the activation of resident immune cells such as microglia. However, peripheral immune cells, which migrate through the blood-brain barrier into the central nervous system (CNS) are also involved in the development of neuroinflammation.

        "abstract": "Haloperidol is a typical antipsychotic used to treat schizophrenia and induces dopamine D2 receptor antagonism. Long-term use of haloperidol can reduce brain size in animals and humans; however, the underlying mechanism of this effect remains unclear. Notch1 signaling regulates the development and function of the nervous system by balancing stem cell proliferation and differentiation. Therefore, we investigated the effects of long-term exposure to haloperidol on human-derived brain organoids, which served as sophisticated in vitro models of human brain development. Long-term exposure to haloperidol reduced the size of brain organoids and decreased the ventricular zone and Notch1 signaling. When propionate, which protects against haloperidol-induced toxicity, was combined with haloperidol, it rescued both the overall size of brain organoids and Notch1 expression levels. Additionally, treatment with valproic acid, a Notch1 activator, partially restored the size of brain organoids and the thickness of the ventricular layer. Taken together, these data suggest that long-term exposure to haloperidol impairs neurodevelopment via Notch1 signaling in brain organoids. These findings contribute to our understanding of antipsychotic drug safety and provide information for new neurodevelopmental toxicity assessments.",

We integrated morphological assessments, behavioral analyses, transcriptomic profiling, and neurotransmitter quantification to evaluate developmental neurotoxicity.\nLurasidone induced dose-dependent developmental toxicity, including reduced survival and hatching rates, decreased body length, and increased pericardial and yolk sac edema. Behavioral assessments revealed significant locomotor impairment and diminished touch response, especially at higher concentrations. Transcriptomic analysis identified 1,907 differentially expressed genes, with upregulation in circadian regulation pathways and downregulation in cell cycle and oxidative phosphorylation pathways. Neurotransmitter profiling showed significant reductions in glutamate, dopamine, and GABA levels.\nThese findings demonstrate lurasidone's potential to disrupt neurodevelopment, suggesting perturbations in excitatory/inhibitory neurotransmitter balance and critical cellular pathways.

        "abstract": "Preterm birth remains a significant global health challenge and is strongly associated with heightened risks of long-term neurodevelopmental impairments, including cognitive delays, behavioural disorders, and emotional dysregulation. In recent years, accumulating evidence has underscored the critical role of the gut microbiota in early brain development through the gut-brain axis. In preterm infants, microbial colonisation is frequently delayed or disrupted due to caesarean delivery, perinatal antibiotic exposure, formula feeding, and prolonged stays in neonatal intensive care units (NICUs), all of which contribute to gut dysbiosis during critical periods of neurodevelopment. This review synthesises current knowledge on the sources, temporal patterns, and determinants of gut microbiota colonisation in preterm infants. This review focuses on the gut bacteriome and uses faecal-sample bacteriome sequencing as its primary method of characterisation. We detail five mechanistic pathways that link microbial disturbances to adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes: immune activation and white matter injury, short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs)-mediated neuroprotection, tryptophan-serotonin metabolic signalling, hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis modulation, and the integrity of intestinal and blood-brain barriers (BBB). We also critically examine emerging microbiota-targeted interventions-including probiotics, prebiotics, human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs), antibiotic stewardship strategies, skin-to-skin contact (SSC), and faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT)-focusing on their mechanisms of action, translational potential, and associated ethical concerns. Finally, we identify key research gaps, including the scarcity of longitudinal studies, limited functional modelling, and the absence of standardised protocols across clinical settings. A comprehensive understanding of microbial-neurodevelopmental interactions may provide a foundation for the development of targeted, timing-sensitive, and ethically sound interventions aimed at improving neurodevelopmental outcomes in this vulnerable population.",

We previously demonstrated that periadolescent depressive-like behaviors occur in a rat model of early-life hypoxia. Here, we investigated the short-term effects of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, sertraline, against later-life behavioral deficits. Rats were exposed to global hypoxia at postnatal day 10 (P10) and then received either sertraline or its vehicle (P24 to P30). Normoxic controls received sertraline or its vehicle. Depressive-like and anxiety-like behaviors were assessed using the forced swim test (FST) and open field test (OFT), respectively. The FST was conducted at P25-26 and the OFT at P27. Rats were sacrificed at P30 to assess hippocampal microRNA (miR) expression and to histologically evaluate hippocampal neuronal densities and synaptophysin (Syp) protein levels. Early-life hypoxic seizures resulted in increased immobility in the FST (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) and decreased exploration in the OFT (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Hypoxia also resulted in chronic alterations in the expression of 25 miRs, 22 of which are known to modulate inflammatory responses and synaptic function. Sertraline treatment normalized hypoxia-induced increased immobility and reversed 17 out of 25 alterations in miR expression. However, sertraline potentiated hypoxia-induced exploratory deficits (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). The drug treatment also resulted in OFT deficits in controls (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) and 13 unique dysregulations in miR expression. Neuronal densities and Syp levels were comparable among all groups. We demonstrate that sertraline reverses hypoxia-induced depressive-like behaviors, possibly by targeting inflammation and synaptic remodeling. Sertraline-induced anxiety-like behaviors may reflect its known transient early side effects and warrant further research on long-term outcomes.",

        "doi": "10.1159/000547803",
        "abstract": "Serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine [5-HT]) plays an important role in early development, and fetal 5-HT has been reported to arise from placental and maternal sources. Previous human studies have established an association between maternal 5-HT levels and neurodevelopmental outcomes in populations with autism. In this study, we analyze umbilical cord blood and placental 5-HT levels at birth to further investigate the relationship of gestational 5-HT levels with birth outcomes and offspring cognitive development.\nParticipants were enrolled in the Safe Passage Study conducted by the Prenatal Alcohol and SIDS and Stillbirth (PASS) Network. Infant cord blood and placental samples were collected postdelivery, and 5-HT levels were measured using high-performance liquid chromatography-fluorometric analysis. The Mullen Scales of Early Learning (MSEL) assessed child development at 12 months. Associations between 5-HT levels and birth outcomes or developmental outcomes were assessed using linear regression models.\nNo significant association was found between cord blood (n = 418) and placental (n = 89) 5-HT levels. Preterm birth was associated with lower cord blood 5-HT levels, and increasing gestational age among full-term infants was associated with higher cord blood 5-HT levels. Cord blood 5-HT was significantly associated with the Mullen Scales of Early Learning Composite Score, and follow-up analyses revealed a significant association between cord blood 5-HT and fine motor skills. No association was found between placental 5-HT and the Mullen composite score.\nTo our knowledge, this study is the first to evaluate the relationship between placental 5-HT levels and cord blood 5-HT levels at birth. The lack of association suggests that cord blood 5-HT levels are likely to be a better index of fetal 5-HT exposure. Associations between cord blood 5-HT and child cognitive development are consistent with previous studies showing an association between maternal 5-HT levels and neurodevelopmental trajectories. Further research is needed to better characterize these relationships and to elucidate the distinct contributions of maternal, placental, and fetal 5-HT sources across developmental time points.",

        "abstract": "Adolescence is a critical neurodevelopmental period characterized by heightened neuroplasticity. While the acute effects of binge ethanol (EtOH) consumption are documented, its long-term impact on both pain sensitivity and microglial activation during adolescence remains unclear. Given serotonin's (5-HT) known involvement in pain processing and sensitivity to EtOH, this study examined the effects of adolescent EtOH binge on microglia-induced neuroinflammation in serotonergic nuclei, downstream 5-HT signaling, and pain sensitivity at different time points after EtOH withdrawal. Adolescent male C57BL/6J mice received triweekly oral gavage of 20\u00a0% EtOH or water for 4 weeks and were assessed after 24\u00a0h and 3 weeks post-withdrawal. We used immunohistochemistry to assess neuroinflammation in the dorsal raphe, median raphe, and raphe magnus by labeling 5-HT, CD68, and P2Y12. Further analyses examined downstream signaling via 5-HT and serotonin transporter (SERT) expression in the nucleus accumbens, anterior cingulate cortex, thalamus, amygdala, hypothalamus, and raphe magnus. Pain sensitivity was then assessed using the Hargreaves test. EtOH exposure led to widespread serotonergic and neuroinflammatory changes. Significant increases in microglia-induced neuroinflammation were observed in the dorsal raphe nucleus, median raphe nucleus, and raphe magnus nucleus after both 24\u00a0h and 3 weeks post-withdrawal, along with significant deficits in 5-HT. Similar 5-HT deficits were observed in downstream regions-notably in the anterior cingulate cortex, thalamus, amygdala, and hypothalamus-at varying time points post-withdrawal. EtOH-exposed mice also showed lasting hyperalgesia at both 24\u00a0h and 3 weeks post-withdrawal that persisted for up to 9 weeks. These results suggest that persistent hyperalgesia following adolescent EtOH binge may be driven by changes in serotonergic function and microglial activation.",

A previous study reported lower whole blood serotonin (WB5-HT) concentrations in the mothers of children with more severe autism. This study attempted to replicate this finding in an independent cohort.\nA latent profile analysis was conducted in 259 children with autism using indicator variables across autistic traits, cognition, and adaptive function. In a subgroup of 162 participants with maternal WB5-HT data, maternal WB5-HT in children with the highest severity profile was compared with maternal WB5-HT in children with other profiles, both overall and across 5 quantiles of the maternal WB5-HT distribution.\nA latent profile analysis solution was identified that stratified participants into low-, medium-, and high-severity profiles. Although this solution was broadly similar to the prior work, the high-severity profile showed different scores in restricted and repetitive behavior, nonverbal IQ, and adaptive function. Median WB5-HT in the high-severity profile did not differ significantly from other profiles, but was lower at the 90th percentile of severity (by 59.40 ng/mL, 95% CI 6.42 to 101.51 ng/mL, adjusted \nIn contrast to the previous study, this study did not find lower group levels of maternal WB5-HT in children with highest autism symptom severity. However, children in the high-severity group were less likely to have maternal WB5-HT values in the upper range of the distribution. This comparative absence of values in the upper range of maternal WB5-HT in this high-severity group warrants further investigation.\nWe worked to ensure race, ethnic, and/or other types of diversity in the recruitment of human participants. We worked to ensure that the study questionnaires were prepared in an inclusive way. We worked to ensure sex balance in the selection of non-human subjects.\nThis study explored the link between serotonin levels in mothers and the severity of autism in their children. Data analyzed from 259 autistic children drawn from the Simons Simplex Collection cohort separated them into three \u201clatent profiles\u201d of low, medium, and high severity. The relation between severity profile and maternal serotonin level was assessed in a subset of 162 children for whom these data were available. Although previous work suggested that serotonin levels were overall lower in the mothers of severely affected children, the present study did not find a significant difference in overall serotonin levels. However, the present study found that fewer mothers of severely affected children had high serotonin levels, which warrants further investigation.",

With the disorder's continuous patterns of inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsiveness, it gets in the way of academic, social, and occupational performance. Individuals affected by ADHD are found among all age groups, though its presentation may change over time. The mechanisms of ADHD seem to be very complex and multifactorial and include disturbances within neuroanatomical structures, neurochemical systems, and developmental trajectories. These influences create the characteristic behavior and cognitive profiles of an individual with ADHD that substantiate the heterogeneity of the disorder.

        "abstract": "Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are commonly prescribed to treat maternal depression during pregnancy, yet their potential impact on foetal brain development remains a concern. Although maternal illness is a known confounder, growing evidence from both clinical and preclinical studies suggests that perinatal SSRI exposure may independently influence neurodevelopmental outcomes. This review draws on rodent studies to explore how developmental SSRI exposure affects the gut microbiome, maternal behaviour, myelination, and offspring social behaviour. Elevated serotonin levels caused by SSRIs can alter both brain development and the maternal gut microbiota, with possible long-term effects on offspring. Behaviourally, SSRI-exposed offspring often show reduced social play, altered social interactions, and sex-specific effects on aggression and sexual behaviour, in which males appear more sensitive to these effects than females. Maternal care is only modestly affected. Overall, developmental SSRI exposure in the absence of maternal illness can disrupt brain development and social behaviour in offspring, potentially through gut-brain axis mechanisms and altered myelination.",

BC induced dose-dependent developmental toxicity, manifested as reduced body length and eye size, elevated heart rate, and morphological abnormalities. Behavioral assays revealed deficits in locomotion and phototaxis. Neurochemical analysis revealed concentration-dependent reductions in serotonin (5-HT) and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). Transgenic imaging indicated impaired neuronal and glial development in the embryos. Untargeted metabolomics revealed disruptions in multiple pathways, particularly glycine, serine, threonine, taurine, and hypotaurine metabolism, which correlated with behavioral changes.

        "abstract": "The serotonergic system, originating in the raphe nuclei, differentially modulates the dorsal and ventral hippocampus, which are implicated in cognition and emotion, respectively. Emerging evidence from rodent models (e.g., neonatal ventral hippocampal lesion, pharmacological NMDA receptor antagonist exposure) and human postmortem studies indicates dorsoventral serotonergic alterations in schizophrenia. These data include elevated 5-HT1A receptor expression in the dorsal hippocampus, linking serotonergic hypofunction to cognitive deficits, and hyperactive 5-HT2A/3 receptor signaling and denser serotonergic innervation in the ventral hippocampus driving local hyperexcitability associated with psychosis and stress responsivity. These dorsoventral serotonergic alterations are shown to disrupt the excitation-inhibition balance, impair synaptic plasticity, and disturb network oscillations, as established by in vivo electrophysiology and functional imaging. Synthesizing these multi-level findings, we propose a novel \"dorsoventral serotonin imbalance\" model of schizophrenia, in which ventral hyperactivation predominantly contributes to psychotic symptoms and dorsal hypoactivity underlies cognitive deficits. We further highlight promising preclinical evidence that selective targeting of region- and receptor-specific targeting, using both pharmacological agents and emerging delivery technologies, may offer novel therapeutic opportunities enabling symptom-specific strategies in schizophrenia.",

        "abstract": "Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by restricted social communication and repetitive behaviors. Prenatal stress is critical in neurodevelopment and increases risk for ASD, particularly in those with greater genetic susceptibility to stress. Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) is one of the most abundant \u03c9-3 fatty acids in the membrane phospholipids of the mammalian brain, and dietary DHA plays an important role in brain development and maintenance of brain structure. In this study, we investigated whether peri-natal supplementation of DHA can alleviate autistic-like behaviors in a genetic risk/stress mouse model and how it alters lipid peroxidation activity and GABAergic system gene expression in the forebrain. Pregnant heterozygous serotonin transporter knockout (SERT-KO) and wild-type (WT) dams were placed in either non-stressed control conditions or chronic variable stress (CVS) conditions and fed either a control diet or a DHA-rich (1% by weight) diet. Offspring of each group were assessed for anxiety and autism-associated behavior at post-natal day 60 using an open field test, elevated plus maze test, repetitive behavior, and the 3-chamber social approach test. A liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS)-based method was used to follow changes in levels of lipid peroxidation products in the cerebral cortex. Male offspring of prenatally stressed SERT-het KO dams exhibited decreased social preference behaviors and increased repetitive grooming behaviors compared to WT control offspring. Moreover, DHA supplementation in male SERT-het mice decreased frequency of grooming behaviors albeit showing no associated effects on social behaviors. Regardless of stress conditions, supplementation of DHA to the WT mice did not result in alterations in grooming nor social interaction in the offspring. Furthermore, no apparent changes were observed in the lipid peroxidation products comparing the stressed and non-stressed brains. ",

        "abstract": "Sertraline (SER) is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) prescribed for depression, including during pregnancy. Existing literature suggests a potential association between gestational SER use and cardiac and neurodevelopmental anomalies in exposed offspring. This study evaluated the relative impacts of SER and its metabolite desmethylsertraline (DES) on the proteome during early development.\nZebrafish embryos and larvae were exposed to individual treatments of translated umbilical cord-blood equivalent concentrations of SER or DES during early developmental stages. Quantified activity tracking and protein expression levels of serotonin transporter (SERT) were used to confirm a significant SSRI effect in exposed larvae. A whole-larvae proteomic analysis was conducted using a label-free quantitative liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry approach. Protein identification was performed using zebrafish and human protein databases.\nApparent therapeutic SSRI effect of exposure doses of SER and DES was confirmed in zebrafish larvae, by reduced activity levels, as well as decreased SERT. DES, but not SER, resulted in several differentially regulated proteins, identified in both the zebrafish and human databases. The results from the two databases correlated and aligned with an increased risk for cardiovascular and neurodevelopmental dysregulation.\nProteomic data suggest that DES, rather than SER, at physiologically relevant doses, may be responsible for adverse clinical outcomes reported after gestational SSRI use. Current data positions larval zebrafish as a possible tool for assessment of long-term risk after gestational SER use, as well as a drug development tool in this context.\nN/A.\nThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s43440-025-00765-y.",

Assessment of the protein content of serum CRP, irisin, meteorin-like protein (metrnl), cerebellar inflammatory markers, serotonin, and BDNF was done by ELISA.

Statistical methods were used in the data analysis, including one-way ANOVA, and t-tests. The VPA group showed significant impairments in social interaction, and cognition in neurobehavioral tests (P\u2009=\u20090.000). A significant increase of CRP, MDA, and inflammatory markers associated with a significant reduction in irisin, metrnl, catalase, CS, serotonin, and BDNF (P\u2009=\u20090.000) was noticed. Besides, cerebellar AMPK and PPAR-\u03b3 gene expressions were down-regulated. Significant cerebellar degenerative changes were also observed (P\u2009=\u20090.000). Training dramatically reversed VPA-induced neurobehavioral, biochemical, and cerebellar degenerative changes. Endurance training has anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic, and antioxidant properties. Adipo-myokines release, enhanced mitochondrial activity, and activation of AMPK and PPAR-\u03b3 pathways could be involved mechanisms.

        "abstract": "Adolescence is a critical neurodevelopmental window characterized by rapid cortical thinning, during which vulnerability to psychiatric disorders significantly increases. Although increased rates of cortical thinning have been associated with adverse mental health outcomes, the biological mechanisms underlying atypical neurodevelopment remain unclear. This study investigates whether genetic predisposition to systemic inflammation, assessed via polygenic scores for C-reactive protein (PGS_CRP), influences cortical thinning trajectories and psychopathology risk in adolescents. Using longitudinal data from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study (baseline n=11,214; follow-up n=7,823), we found that higher genetic susceptibility to inflammation was associated with accelerated cortical thinning, particularly in medial temporal and insular regions (\u03b2 = -0.013 ~ -0.018, p.FDR < 0.05), and increased externalizing psychopathology symptoms (\u03b2 = 0.167, p.FDR < 0.05). Early-life infections independently predicted greater depressive and externalizing symptoms (\u03b2 = 0.511 ~0.608, p.FDR < 0.05) but did not interact significantly with genetic predisposition. Structural equation modeling revealed that cortical thinning partially mediated the relationship between genetic inflammation risk and externalizing symptoms. Moreover, neurobiological annotation showed regional overlaps between inflammation-linked cortical thinning and neurotransmitter receptor gradients involving serotonin, GABA, cannabinoid, and glutamate systems. These findings provide evidence for genetic predisposition to inflammation as a factor in adolescent cortical maturation and behavioral outcomes, highlighting potential neuroimmune mechanisms underpinning vulnerability to mental health disorders during this sensitive developmental period.",

        "abstract": "Pregnancy presents a critical period during which the use of antidepressants requires cautious evaluation, especially due to the high incidence of depression in women of reproductive age. Vortioxetine hydrobromide (VOX), a newer multimodal antidepressant, is increasingly favored for its improved efficacy and tolerability. However, its safety profile during gestation and its potential long-term impact on fetal brain development remain insufficiently explored. This study aimed to assess the reproductive and developmental neurotoxicity of VOX administered at clinically relevant doses during pregnancy using a Wistar rat model. Pregnant dams received daily oral doses of either 1\u00a0mg/kg or 2\u00a0mg/kg of VOX from gestation day (GD) 6 to 21. On GD 21, the dams were euthanized, and fetuses along with placental tissues were collected for further analysis. Fetal brains underwent morphological, neurochemical, and histopathological evaluations. Exposure to VOX at the higher dose led to significant maternal and fetal toxicity, marked by reduced maternal weight gain, smaller litter sizes, and decreased fetal and placental weights. Notably, adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes were observed, including reduced fetal brain dimensions, cortical and hippocampal thinning, altered levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), disrupted monoaminergic neurotransmitter levels (serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine), elevated apoptotic markers (Bax/Bcl-2 ratio), and increased acetylcholinesterase activity. These findings suggest that prenatal VOX exposure disrupts essential neurodevelopmental pathways, particularly those involving BDNF and monoaminergic signaling, potentially leading to persistent alterations in brain development. This is the first study to systematically demonstrate the developmental neurotoxicity of VOX, emphasizing the urgent need for further investigation into its safety during pregnancy.",

        "abstract": "Aggressiveness is a complex social behavior that ranges from adaptive to pathological forms. This review synthesizes current knowledge of the neural circuits underlying aggression and explores how this informs neurosurgical strategies for severe, treatment-resistant cases.\nWe reviewed recent experimental and clinical studies of the anatomical, functional, and neurochemical bases of aggression, focusing on reactive and proactive subtypes. Emphasis was placed on animal models, optogenetics, and human deep brain stimulation (DBS) approaches.\nInternal states - such as hormonal status, energy balance, and prior experience - modulate the threshold for aggression. The ventrolateral part of the ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus (VMHvl), particularly its ER\u03b1-expressing neurons, plays a central role in triggering aggressive behavior. The core aggression circuit (CAC) includes the VMHvl, amygdala, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, and ventral premammillary nucleus, under modulation by prefrontal inputs. Aggression is expressed through a direct VMHvl-periaqueductal gray (PAG) pathway for innate actions and an indirect, dopamine-dependent striatal pathway for learned aggression. Serotonin inhibits, while dopamine promotes, proactive aggression.\nPathological impulsive aggression, often linked to neurodevelopmental disorders and intellectual disability, may become refractory to pharmacotherapy. In such cases, neurosurgical approaches targeting the Sano triangle-originally described as part of the posterior hypothalamus-have shown promise. Understanding the connectivity and functional role of this region is essential for optimizing targeted interventions. Viewing aggression as a disorder of internal state regulation within defined circuits provides a framework for ethical and effective neuromodulation.",

        "abstract": "Postweaning to early adulthood is a critical period for neural maturation, with dopamine (DA) and serotonin (5-HT) systems undergoing significant changes. Excessive sucrose (SUC) intake during this period is associated with metabolic and neuropsychiatric disorders; however, its effects on neurodevelopment remain unclear, especially in comparison to noncaloric sweeteners like saccharin (SAC). Therefore, we aimed to investigate the impact of chronic SUC and SAC consumption from postweaning to early adulthood on DA and 5-HT metabolism in the mesocorticolimbic system. Male mice of the Institute of Cancer Research strain received 20 % SUC or 0.2 % SAC ad libitum from postnatal days 21-56. Response to amphetamine (AMP) treatment was determined using the open-field test. The levels of DA, 5-HT, and their metabolites in the mesocorticolimbic system were assessed using high-performance liquid chromatography. Unlike SAC, SUC increased locomotor activity and attenuated the AMP response. SUC and SAC reduced DA levels in the prefrontal cortex (PFC). SUC altered DA turnover in the dorsal striatum and hippocampus, whereas SAC affected the PFC. Differences in the 5-HT/DA ratio further highlighted distinct neurobiological effects. Excessive SUC and SAC consumption during the critical developmental window induces region-specific alterations in DA and 5-HT metabolism, suggesting distinct neural effects of caloric vs. noncaloric sweeteners. These findings emphasize the need for further research on their long-term neurodevelopmental consequences.",

During postnatal development, the immature brain undergoes experience-dependent structural and functional shaping and modifications during critical period (CP) time windows to achieve the full maturation of brain functions. Plasticity is higher during neurodevelopmental CP windows and is limited in the adult brain, including during neuropsychiatric disorders. Notably, the neurotransmitters \u03b3-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and serotonin are two fundamental players controlling and modulating, respectively, brain plasticity in the developing and adult brain.

        "abstract": "This paper explores the therapeutic potential of DMT in neuroprotective strategies, particularly concerning ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) and neurodegenerative disorders. Besides its potent serotonin receptor actions, DMT is also an endogenous agonist of the sigma-1 receptor (Sig-1R). Sigma receptors are a unique family of proteins with high expression in the brain and spinal cord and have been involved in the etiology, symptom course and treatment of several central nervous system disorders. Our previous theoretical and experimental work strongly suggest that targeting sigma (and serotonin) receptors via DMT may be particularly useful for treatment in a number of neurological conditions like stroke, global brain ischemia, Alzheimer's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. In this article, we briefly overview the function of Sig1-R in cellular bioenergetics with a focus on the processes involved in IRI and summarize the results of our previous preclinical (in vitro and in vivo) DMT studies aiming at mitigating IRI and related cellular neuropathologies. We conclude that the effect of DMT may involve a universal role in cellular protective mechanisms suggesting therapeutic potentials against different components and types of IRIs emerging in local and generalized brain ischemia after stroke or cardiac arrest. The multiple neuroprotective mechanisms facilitated by DMT may position it as a model molecule for developing pharmacological treatments for neurodegenerative disorders.",

        "abstract": "Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) comprises a group of neurodevelopmental disorders characterized by alterations in communication, repetitive behaviors and impaired socialization. The precise etiology and pathogenesis remain unclear, and there is currently no effective treatment for this condition. Emerging research highlights the role of immune dysregulation in ASD pathophysiology. Mast cells (MCs) are immune cells traditionally associated with allergic diseases but also play a crucial role in other inflammatory and immune processes. Increased MC activity may be linked to the development of ASD in certain patients. This review explores the potential mechanisms involving MCs in ASD, including neuroinflammation, autoimmunity, and disruptions in the gut-brain axis. Evidence suggests that MC mediators such as histamine, serotonin, and cytokines influence neuroinflammatory pathways that are altered in ASD, and MCs can interact with other immune and neuronal cells contributing to ASD symptoms. Autoimmunity is frequently present in both ASD patients and their mothers, and MCs could originate these processes by modulation of lymphocyte populations or secretion of self-antigens. Finally, MC involvement in gut permeability and microbiota dysbiosis underscores their role in gastrointestinal comorbidities frequent in ASD. Targeting MC activity through pharmacological agents offers promising therapeutic avenues. This comprehensive review sheds light on immune-mediated processes underlying ASD and discusses potential future strategies for intervention.",

        "abstract": "Serotonin plays a prominent role in neurodevelopment, regulating processes from cell division to synaptic connectivity. Clinical studies suggest that alterations in serotonin signalling such as genetic polymorphisms or antidepressant exposure during pregnancy are risk factors for neurodevelopmental disorders. However, an understanding of how dysfunctional neuromodulation alters systems level activity over neocortical development is lacking. Here, we use a longitudinal imaging approach to investigate how genetics, pharmacology, and aversive experience disrupt state-dependent serotonin signalling with pathological consequences for sensory processing. We find that all three factors lead to increased neocortical serotonin levels during the initial postnatal period. Genetic deletion of the serotonin transporter or antidepressant dosing results in a switch from hypo- to hyper-cortical activity that arises as a consequence of altered cortical GABAergic microcircuitry. However, the trajectories of these manipulations differ with postnatal exposure to antidepressants having effects on adult sensory encoding. The latter is not seen in the genetic model despite a similar early phenotype, and a distinct influence of maternal genotype on the development of supragranular layers. These results reveal the dynamics and critical nature of serotonin signalling during perinatal life; pharmacological targeting of which can have profound life-long consequences for cognitive development of the offspring.",

        "abstract": "Tic disorders (TD) represent a prevalent neurodevelopmental condition in children, characterised by involuntary, sudden motor or vocal tics. Dysfunction of the dopamine system plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of TD. Recent findings indicate that deep brain stimulation, by modulating striatal dopamine release, substantially alleviates tic symptoms. Neuroimaging studies have shown increased dopamine transporter binding and decreased serotonin levels in patients with TD. The presence of anti-dopamine D2 receptor autoantibodies, which correlate with disease severity, suggests immune involvement in the onset of TD. Nutritional factors influence the dopaminergic system's functionality by affecting neurotransmitter synthesis and metabolism, modulating gut microbiota and contributing to neuroinflammation. Clinical studies have demonstrated that interventions combining probiotics and fructooligosaccharides can help regulate neurotransmitter metabolism, whereas dietary patterns such as the ketogenic, Mediterranean and Mediterranean-DASH intervention for neurodegenerative delay diets exhibit anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects. The risk of TD in offspring is significantly associated with maternal autoimmune diseases and inflammatory states, with metabolic syndrome further affecting the dopaminergic system via AT1 receptor autoantibodies. Nutritional intervention-based treatment strategies present promising directions for TD management, warranting further investigation into the nutrition-immune-neurotransmitter network, the development of personalised nutritional plans and the validation of their clinical efficacy through large-scale randomised controlled trials. This review summarises the alterations in the dopaminergic system in TD, the regulatory effects of nutritional factors on dopamine levels, the interactions between neuroinflammation and the dopaminergic system and treatment strategies based on nutritional interventions, laying a theoretical foundation for understanding TD pathogenesis and advancing novel therapeutic approaches.",

        "doi": "10.1016/j.pbb.2025.174112",
        "abstract": "Opioid use during pregnancy has increased drastically in the last two decades. Pregnant women who use opioids are often prescribed Medications for Opioid Use Disorder (MOUDs), including buprenorphine (BUP), to mitigate negative effects on the fetus. However, BUP exposure during pregnancy may still negatively impact maternal care behavior and offspring neurodevelopment. In the current study, we used a translational rodent model to investigate the effects of continued morphine or BUP use from preconception (7\u00a0days prior to mating) to the early postpartum period, as well as the transition from morphine to BUP during early pregnancy (gestational day (GD) 5), on both maternal care behaviors and acute offspring neurodevelopmental outcomes. Our results reveal that exposure to BUP beginning before pregnancy or on GD5 resulted in decreased nesting quality, maternal motivation, and pup-directed care behaviors as compared to controls. For the offspring, BUP-exposure resulted in increased pup mortality, more neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome-like (NOWS) symptoms, altered norepinephrine levels in the brain, and decreased offspring weight, body length, and presence of milk bands compared to vehicle pups. Importantly, maternal care behavior was significantly correlated with offspring mortality, physical maturation, and NOWS-like scores, suggesting that at least some of the adverse effects were driven by impairments in maternal care. Morphine-exposed dams and pups showed overall fewer impairments compared to BUP-exposed dams and pups. This highlights that more research is needed to further understand the unique impact of BUP on the maternal brain and subsequent infant outcomes to mitigate potential adverse effects in pregnant women with MOUD prescriptions.",

Neurotransmitter imbalances have been implicated in ASD, but few studies have examined cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) alterations in ASD patients. Identifying specific CSF biomarkers could enhance our understanding of the underlying neurobiology and improve diagnostic and therapeutic approaches.\nCSF samples were collected from 17 children, including 8 with ASD and 9 typically developing controls. Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) was used to analyze neurotransmitter levels and metabolites in the CSF samples. Statistical comparisons were performed to identify group differences in neurotransmitter concentrations.\nASD participants had significantly lower levels of glutamine, norepinephrine, and kynurenine compared to controls. Neurotransmitter dysregulation, particularly in the glutamine-glutamate cycle, was observed in ASD, potentially contributing to core symptoms.\nOur findings suggest that neurotransmitter imbalances in the CSF could serve as potential biomarkers for ASD.

        "doi": "10.1002/npr2.70028",
        "abstract": "Atomoxetine, a selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (NRI), is commonly prescribed for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and has shown effectiveness in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Although mood disturbances and psychiatric symptoms are recognized side effects, pathological laughter has not been previously reported.\nWe present the case of a 6-year-old boy diagnosed with both ASD and ADHD who developed sudden, uncontrollable episodes of pathological laughter after beginning low-dose atomoxetine (5\u2009mg/day, ~0.25\u2009mg/kg). The child had a history of hyperactivity and aggression, managed with risperidone and clonidine. Within 5\u2009days of initiating atomoxetine, he exhibited frequent, spontaneous laughter lasting 2-5\u2009min without any apparent emotional trigger. These episodes resolved within 10\u2009days despite continued atomoxetine treatment, coinciding with a minor increase in risperidone dosage. Following this period, the child displayed noticeable improvements in attention, eye contact, and overall cooperation. Atomoxetine was later increased to 10\u2009mg/day, with no recurrence of pathological laughter.\nThis case suggests that pathological laughter may be a rare but temporary side effect of atomoxetine, even at low doses. Given the child's familial history of bipolar disorder and the influence of catecholamines on mood regulation, clinicians should be vigilant in monitoring mood-related side effects in children with neurodevelopmental disorders. This report emphasizes the need for personalized treatment approaches and further investigation into the mechanisms and risk factors underlying this phenomenon.",

Loss of noradrenergic neurons was most severe in AD and PD. Only in DS, levels of DYRK1A - a kinase encoded on chromosome 21 and implicated in neurodegenerative processes - were elevated and negatively correlated to biogenic amine levels.

        "abstract": "Anxiety and depression during pregnancy are recognized as major public health concerns. Depression and anxiety, if untreated, severely affect both mother and the fetus, especially during pregnancy. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) are frequently prescribed drugs to manage above conditions during pregnancy. Although these medications affect the levels of neurotransmitters, research indicates their potential impact on development of the fetus. Studies on maternal exposure to SSRIs and SNRIs show possible risks of offspring's congenital cardiovascular abnormalities and anomalies of the kidney and digestive system. Maternal exposure to selective SSRIs and SNRIs during pregnancy has been associated with certain adverse perinatal outcomes, including preterm birth, low birth weight, and neonatal adaptation syndrome. Exposure to SSRIs and SNRIs also increases the possible risk of persistent pulmonary hypertension in the newborn. However, evidence regarding long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes remains inconclusive, with studies showing mixed results. Therefore, based on the available data, it is hypothesized that these drugs may potentially have direct or indirect effects on reproductive outcomes of the progeny. Because of the increasing occurrence of maternal depression worldwide and the consequent usage of SSRIs and SNRIs, there is an urgent need for additional data to better understand the risk of developmental toxicity related to the use of these antidepressants during pregnancy. This review, therefore, aims to examine the effects of SSRIs and SNRIs exposure during pregnancy on fetal growth, postnatal development and long-term reproductive outcomes of the progeny with regard to a careful consideration of better treatment options.",

        "abstract": "In captive primate facilities, relocations-moves, within the facility, from one cage to another-can be common events. On the one hand, relocations are generally regarded as relatively benign events, as past studies have generally shown only transient elevations in cortisol concentrations following relocation. On the other hand, the frequency of relocations has been associated with adverse health and behavioral outcomes. As part of a larger project examining the effects of stress on follicular development, we relocated adult female rhesus monkeys on a weekly basis for several months in each of 3 years, and measured concentrations of urinary cortisol, epinephrine, and norepinephrine, as well as hair cortisol. Results for urinary cortisol and epinephrine were similar: significant elevations immediately following initiation of relocations during Years 1 and 3, and reductions in concentrations by the end of the relocation sequences in Year 1. No changes were seen for these two measures in Year 2. In contrast, elevated norepinephrine concentrations were found for all 3 years. Significant elevations in hair cortisol concentrations were found for Years 2 and 3, and suggested persisting and cumulative effects of relocations on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. Together, these results suggest that relocations may not be the benign events suggested by earlier studies. Given that all organs of the body are innervated by the sympathetic nervous system (the principal source of norepinephrine in blood and urine) and that cells of the body have glucocorticoid and catecholamine receptors, our results suggest possible mechanisms by which repeated relocations may result in adverse health outcomes. Repeated relocations may be a valuable model for experimentally generating moderate stress; however, we encourage colony managers and scientists to minimize such events to enhance the welfare of the animals.",

        "abstract": "Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a genetically heterogeneous syndrome characterized by repetitive, restricted, and stereotyped behaviors, along with persistent difficulties with social interaction and communication. Despite its increasing prevalence globally, the underlying pathogenic mechanisms of this complex neurodevelopmental disorder remain poorly understood. Therefore, the identification of reliable biomarkers could play a crucial role in enabling early screening and more precise classification of ASD subtypes, offering valuable insights into its physiopathology and aiding the customization of treatment or early interventions. Biogenic amines, including serotonin, histamine, dopamine, epinephrine, norepinephrine, and polyamines, are a class of organic compounds mainly produced by the decarboxylation of amino acids. A substantial portion of the genetic variation observed in ASD has been linked to genes that are either directly or indirectly involved in the metabolism of biogenic amines. Their potential involvement in ASD has become an area of growing interest due to their pleiotropic activities in the central nervous system, where they act as both neurotransmitters and neuromodulators or hormones. This review examines the role of biogenic amines in ASD, with a particular focus on genetic alterations in the enzymes responsible for their synthesis and degradation.",

        "abstract": "Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by developmental impairments, inattention, motor hyperactivity, and impulsivity. Currently, there is no effective intervention that can completely cure it. One of the pathogenic mechanisms of ADHD involves abnormalities in the norepinephrine (NE) pathway within the prefrontal cortex (PFC). In recent years, transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation (taVNS), a non-invasive neuromodulation technique, has demonstrated promising potential in the treatment of neurological and psychiatric disorders. However, its application in the management of ADHD remains relatively unexplored. Previous studies have shown that taVNS exerts therapeutic effects on attention, cognition, arousal, perception, and behavioral regulation primarily through activating the vagus nerve conduction pathway, specifically targeting the nucleus tractus solitarius - locus coeruleus - NE pathway. These findings have led to the hypothesis that taVNS may be an effective intervention for ADHD, with NE and its pathway playing a pivotal role in this context. Therefore, this review comprehensively examines the correlation between NE pathway alterations in the PFC and ADHD, the mechanism of action of taVNS, and the potential role of the NE pathway in treating ADHD with taVNS, aiming to provide a theoretical foundation for clinical applications.",

Prenatal exposure to VLZ at 2\u202fmg/day resulted in significant maternal, reproductive, and embryo-fetal toxicity, characterized by reduced food intake, diminished weight gain in pregnant dams, and smaller litter sizes, along with decreased fetal and placental weights. These effects were associated with developmental neurotoxicity, which manifested as decreased fetal brain size and weight, a substantial reduction in neocortical layer thickness, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression, serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine neurotransmitter levels (5-HT, DA, and NE), and increased apoptotic activity (Bax and Bcl-2 ratio) and acetylcholinesterase levels in the developing brain. Our findings indicate that prenatal VLZ exposure interfere with crucial brain development processes involving the BDNF/Bax-Bcl2/5-HT signalling pathways, leading to long-lasting neurodevelopmental impairments. This study is the first to document the adverse effects of VLZ on fetal brain development, highlighting the need for further research to assess the safety of VLZ use during pregnancy.",

        "abstract": "The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (Fifth Edition) classifies attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) as a neurodevelopmental disorder that interferes with human functioning and development. As the clinical presentation of ADHD involves a deficiency in executive function, neurocognitive deficits involving distinctive neuropathological changes must be present for clinical diagnosis.\nThe vesicular monoamine transporter (VMAT), specifically VMAT-2, plays a role in ADHD pathogenesis. In addition, experimental data show that the stimulants (amphetamines and methylphenidate) are first-line treatments for the condition because of their extensive interaction with VMAT-2. The interactions of peptides, bupropion, and nutritional supplements with VMAT-2 receptors have been researched, but more evidence is needed to elucidate their pharmacodynamic properties. Therefore, this literature review evaluated the current pharmacological treatment modalities, peptides, and nutritional supplements for ADHD that target the VMAT-2 system.\nWe obtained relevant studies from several platforms, including the National Center for Biotechnology, Clinical Key, Access Medicine, and PubMed. From the results of these studies, we observed that stimulants interact highly with the VMAT-2 transporter, with omega-3 fatty acids, peptides, and bupropion exerting some modulatory activity on VMAT-2. These agents should be considered for the future treatment of ADHD, although clinical-level research involving human participants is necessary.",

Catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) regulates epinephrine (E), norepinephrine (NE), and dopamine (DA) and is implicated in both anxiety and psychotic disorders. The aim of this study was to determine how COMT variation relates to psychological anxiety and associated stress physiology responsiveness to better understand symptom heterogeneity in people with 22q11.2DS. We examined COMT allelic variation in relation to anxiety and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) and sympathetic-adrenomedullary (SAM) hormonal stress indicators in 30 children and adolescents with 22q11.2DS. Contrary to expectation, individuals with the higher activity COMTval allele had higher anxiety levels versus those with the low activity (COMTmet) allele (p\u2009=\u20090.021; Glass' \u0394\u2009=\u20090.69). Anxiety was not correlated with salivary cortisol (CORT) or alpha-amylase (sAA) in either group. Groups did not differ in CORT levels (p\u2009=\u20090.58), but the COMTmet group had higher sAA (p\u2009=\u20090.026; Glass' \u0394\u2009=\u20090.67, uncorrected) suggesting greater SAM reactivity but not HPA activity. This suggests that COMT allelic variation may contribute to differences in acute SAM but not slower HPA stress reactivity in those with 22q11.2DS.",

Their mechanism of action at synaptic level has been extensively studied. However, it is less clear how their mechanism of action determines clinically observed benefits. To help bridge this gap, we provide a comprehensive review of stimulant effects, with an emphasis on nuclear medicine and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings. There is evidence that stimulant-induced modulation of dopamine and norepinephrine neurotransmission optimizes engagement of task-related brain networks, increases perceived saliency, and reduces interference from the default mode network. An acute administration of stimulants may reduce brain alterations observed in untreated individuals in fronto-striato-parieto-cerebellar networks during tasks or at rest. Potential effects of prolonged treatment remain controversial. Overall, neuroimaging has fostered understanding on stimulant mechanism of action. However, studies are often limited by small samples, short or no follow-up, and methodological heterogeneity. Future studies should address age-related and longer-term effects, potential differences among stimulants, and predictors of treatment response.",

In addition to the genetic factors, multiple environmental factors have been related to the development of ASD. Animal models can serve as crucial tools for understanding the complexity of ASD. In this study, a chemical model of ASD has been developed in zebrafish by exposing embryos to valproic acid (VPA) from 4 to 48 h post-fertilization, rearing them to the adult stage in fish water. For the first time, an integrative approach combining behavioral analysis and neurotransmitters profile has been used for determining the effects of early-life exposure to VPA both in the larval and adult stages. Larvae from VPA-treated embryos showed hyperactivity and decreased visual and vibrational escape responses, as well as an altered neurotransmitters profile, with increased glutamate and decreased acetylcholine and norepinephrine levels. Adults from VPA-treated embryos exhibited impaired social behavior characterized by larger shoal sizes and a decreased interest for their conspecifics. A neurotransmitter analysis revealed a significant decrease in dopamine and GABA levels in the brain. These results support the potential predictive validity of this model for ASD research.",

Furthermore, the WKY/NCrl rats constituted the control group. The evaluation of behavior involved the open field test and the Morris water maze test. HPLC, LC-MS, ELISA, immunohistochemistry, Western blot, and RT-qPCR were utilized to scrutinize the catecholamine neurotransmitter content and the expression of proteins and genes associated with the dopamine receptor D1 (DRD1)/cAMP/protein kinase A (PKA)-cAMP response element-binding (CREB) pathway in prefrontal cortex (PFC) and striatum.\nMPH and LMQXM ameliorated hyperactivity and learning and memory deficits of SHR/NCrl rats. Among them, LMQXM-MD and MPH also upregulated dopamine (DA), norepinephrine (NE), adenylate cyclase (AC) and cAMP levels, and the expression of proteins and genes associated with the DRD1/cAMP/PKA-CREB pathway in PFC and striatum of SHR/NCrl rats. PFC and striatum DA levels were also upregulated in the LMQXM-LD group as well as the striatum DA levels in the LMQXM-HD group, but there were no statistically significant differences in their NE levels compared to the SHR group. LMQXM-LD and LMQXM-HD also upregulated some DRD1/cAMP/PKA-CREB pathway-related proteins and gene expression, but the effects were discernibly disparate in PFC and striatum. Upon comprehensive analysis, LMQXM-MD appeared to be the most effective dose.\nOur study tentatively suggests that LMQXM may rectify hyperactivity and learning and memory deficits of SHR/NCrl rats by elevating catecholamine neurotransmitters in the PFC and striatum. This effect may be attributed to the potential activation of the DRD1/cAMP/PKA-CREB signaling pathway, which appears to achieve an optimal response at moderate doses.",

        "abstract": "Childhood obesity increases the risk of health and cognitive disorders in adulthood. Consuming high-fat diets (HFD) during critical neurodevelopmental periods, like childhood, impairs cognition and memory in humans and animals, affecting the function and connectivity of brain structures related to emotional memory. However, the underlying mechanisms of such phenomena need to be better understood. This study aimed to investigate the neurochemical profile of the amygdala and hippocampus, brain structures involved in emotional memory, during the acquisition of conditioned odor aversion in male rats that consumed a HFD from weaning to adulthood. The rats gained weight, experienced metabolic changes, and reduced insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance. Rats showed enhanced odor aversion memory, contrary to the expected cognitive impairments. This memory enhancement was accompanied by increased noradrenergic and glutamatergic neurotransmission in the amygdala and hippocampus. Importantly, this upregulation was specific to stimuli exposure, as basal neurotransmitter levels remained unaltered by the HFD. Our results suggest that HFD modifies cognitive function by altering neurochemical signaling, in this case, upregulating neurotransmitter levels rendering a stronger memory trace, demonstrating that metabolic dysfunctions do not only trigger exclusively detrimental plasticity processes but also render enhanced plastic effects depending on the type of information.",

        "abstract": "The objective of the present narrative review was to synthesize existing clinical and epidemiological findings linking manganese (Mn) exposure biomarkers to autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and to discuss key pathophysiological mechanisms of neurodevelopmental disorders that may be affected by this metal. Existing epidemiological data demonstrated both direct and inverse association between Mn body burden and ASD, or lack of any relationship. In contrast, the majority of studies revealed significantly higher Mn levels in subjects with ADHD, as well as direct relationship between Mn body burden with hyperactivity and inattention scores in children, although several studies reported contradictory results. Existing laboratory studies demonstrated that impaired attention and hyperactivity in animals following Mn exposure was associated with dopaminergic dysfunction and neuroinflammation. Despite lack of direct evidence on Mn-induced neurobiological alterations in patients with ASD and ADHD, a plethora of studies demonstrated that neurotoxic effects of Mn overexposure may interfere with key mechanisms of pathogenesis inherent to these neurodevelopmental disorders. Specifically, Mn overload was shown to impair not only dopaminergic neurotransmission, but also affect metabolism of glutamine/glutamate, GABA, serotonin, noradrenaline, thus affecting neuronal signaling. In turn, neurotoxic effects of Mn may be associated with its ability to induce oxidative stress, apoptosis, and neuroinflammation, and/or impair neurogenesis. Nonetheless, additional detailed studies are required to evaluate the association between environmental Mn exposure and/or Mn body burden and neurodevelopmental disorders at a wide range of concentrations to estimate the potential dose-dependent effects, as well as environmental and genetic factors affecting this association.",

        "doi": "10.2147/NDT.S455279",
        "abstract": "Schizophrenia is a disease with a complex pathological mechanism that is influenced by multiple genes. The study of its pathogenesis is dominated by the dopamine hypothesis, as well as other hypotheses such as the 5-hydroxytryptamine hypothesis, glutamate hypothesis, immune-inflammatory hypothesis, gene expression abnormality hypothesis, and neurodevelopmental abnormality hypothesis. The first generation of antipsychotics was developed based on dopaminergic receptor antagonism, which blocks dopamine D2 receptors in the brain to exert antipsychotic effects. The second generation of antipsychotics acts by dual blockade of 5-hydroxytryptamine and dopamine receptors. From the third generation of antipsychotics onwards, the therapeutic targets for antipsychotic schizophrenia expanded beyond D2 receptor blockade to explore D2 receptor partial agonism and the antipsychotic effects of new targets such as D3, 5-HT1A, 5-HT7, and mGlu2/3 receptors. The main advantages of the second and third generation antipsychotics over first-generation antipsychotics are the reduction of side effects and the improvement of negative symptoms, and even though third-generation antipsychotics do not directly block D2 receptors, the modulation of the dopamine transmitter system is still an important part of their antipsychotic process. According to recent research, several receptors, including 5-hydroxytryptamine, glutamate, \u03b3-aminobutyric acid, acetylcholine receptors and norepinephrine, play a role in the development of schizophrenia. Therefore, the focus of developing new antipsychotic drugs has shifted towards agonism or inhibition of these receptors. Specifically, the development of NMDARs stimulants, GABA receptor agonists, mGlu receptor modulators, cholinergic receptor modulators, 5-HT2C receptor agonists and alpha-2 receptor modulators has become the main direction. Animal experiments have confirmed the antipsychotic effects of these drugs, but their pharmacokinetics and clinical applicability still require further exploration. Research on alternative targets for antipsychotic drugs, beyond the dopamine D2 receptor, has expanded the potential treatment options for schizophrenia and gives an important way to address the challenge of refractory schizophrenia. This article aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the research on therapeutic targets and medications for schizophrenia, offering valuable insights for both treatment and further research in this field.",

        "doi": "10.1016/j.taap.2024.116867",
        "abstract": "Lisdexamfetamine (LDX) is a d-amphetamine prodrug used to treat attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder, a common neurodevelopmental disorder in children and adolescents. Due to its action mediated by elevated levels of catecholamines, mainly dopamine and noradrenaline, which influence hormonal regulation and directly affect the gonads, this drug may potentially disrupt reproductive performance. This study evaluated the effects of exposure to LDX from the juvenile to peripubertal period (critical stages of development) on systemic and reproductive toxicity parameters in male rats. Male Wistar rats (23\u00a0days old) were treated with 0; 5.2; 8.6 or 12.1\u00a0mg/kg/day of LDX from post-natal day (PND) 23 to 53, by gavage. LDX treatment led to reduced daily food and water consumption, as well as a decrease in social behaviors. The day of preputial separation remained unaltered, although the treated animals exhibited reduced weight. At PND 54, the treated animals presented signs of systemic toxicity, evidenced by a reduction in body weight gain, increase in the relative weight of the liver, spleen, and seminal gland, reduction in erythrocyte and leukocyte counts, reduced total protein levels, and disruptions in oxidative parameters. In adulthood, there was an increase in immobile sperm, reduced sperm count, morphometric changes in the testis, and altered oxidative parameters, without compromising male sexual behavior and fertility. These findings showed that LDX-treatment during the juvenile and peripubertal periods induced immediate systemic toxicity and adversely influenced reproductive function in adult life, indicating that caution is necessary when prescribing this drug during the peripubertal phase.",

        "abstract": "Stressful events during pregnancy impact on the progeny neurodevelopment. However, little is known about preconceptional stress effects. The rat social isolation represents an animal model of chronic stress inducing a variety of dysfunctions. Moreover, social deprivation during adolescence interferes with key neurodevelopmental processes. Here, we investigated the development of behavioural, neurochemical and redox alterations in the male offspring of socially isolated female rats before pregnancy, reared in group (GRP) or in social isolation (ISO) from weaning until young-adulthood. To this aim, females were reared in GRP or in ISO conditions, from PND21 to PND70, when they were mated. Their male offspring was housed in GRP or ISO conditions through adolescence and until PND70, when passive avoidance-PA, novel object recognition-NOR and open field-OF tests were performed. Levels of noradrenaline (NA), serotonin (5-HT), 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA), glutamate (GLU) and GABA were assessed in the prefrontal cortex (PFC). Moreover, cortical ROS levels were quantified, as well as NF-kB and the NADPH oxidase NOX2 expression, redox status (expressed as GSH:GSSG ratio) and SOD1 amount. A significant decrease of the latency time in the PA was observed in the offspring of ISO females. In the NOR test, while a significant increase in the exploratory activity towards the novel object was observed in the offspring of GRP females, no significant differences were found in the offspring of ISO females. No significant differences were found in the OF test among experimental groups. Theoffspring of ISO females showed increased NA and 5-HIAA levels, whereas in the offspring persistently housed in isolation condition from weaninguntil adulthood, we detected reduced 5-HT levels and ehnanced 5-HIAA amount. No significant changes in GLU concentrations were detected, while decreased GABA content was observed in the offspring of ISO females exposed to social isolation. Increased ROS levels as well as reduced NF-\u03baB, NOX2 expression were detected in the offspring of ISO females. This was accompanied by reduced redox status and enhanced SOD1 levels. In conclusion, our results suggest that female exposure to chronic social stress before pregnancy might have a profound influence on the offspring neurodevelopment in terms of cognitive, neurochemical and redox-related alterations, identifying this specific time window for possible preventive and therapeutic strategies.",

        "abstract": "Angelman syndrome (AS) is a rare neurodevelopmental disorder that is typically caused by deletion or a loss-of-function mutation of the maternal copy of the ubiquitin ligase E3A (UBE3A) gene. The disorder is characterized by severe intellectual disability, deficits in speech, motor abnormalities, altered electroencephalography (EEG) activity, spontaneous epileptic seizures, sleep disturbances, and a happy demeanor with frequent laughter. Regarding electrophysiologic abnormalities in particular, enhanced delta oscillatory power and an elevated excitatory/inhibitory (E/I) ratio have been documented in AS, with E/I ratio especially studied in rodent models. These electrophysiologic characteristics appear to relate with the greatly elevated rates of epilepsy in individuals with AS, and associated hypersynchronous neural activity. Here we briefly review findings on EEG, E/I ratio, and epileptic seizures in AS, including data from rodent models of the disorder. We summarize pharmacologic approaches that have been used to treat behavioral aspects of AS, including neuropsychiatric phenomena and sleep disturbances, as well as seizures in the context of the disorder. Antidepressants such as SSRIs and atypical antipsychotics are among the medications that have been used behaviorally, whereas anticonvulsant drugs such as valproic acid and lamotrigine have frequently been used to control seizures in AS. We end by suggesting novel uses for some existing pharmacologic agents in AS, including noradrenergic transmission reducing drugs (alpha2 agonists, beta blockers, alpha1 antagonists) and cholinesterase inhibitors, where these various classes of drugs may have the ability to ameliorate both behavioral disturbances and seizures.",

        "abstract": "The development of animal models of mental disorders is an important task since such models are useful for studying the neurobiological mechanisms of psychopathologies and for trial of new therapeutic drugs. One way to model pathologies of the nervous system is to impair fetal neurodevelopment through stress of the pregnant future mother, or prenatal stress (PS). The use of variable frequency ultrasound (US) in rodents is a promising method of imitating psychological stress, to which women in modern society are most often subjected. The aim of our study was to investigate the effect of PS induced by exposure to variable frequency ultrasound (US PS) throughout the gestational period on the adult rat offspring, namely, to identify features of behavioral alterations and neurochemical brain parameters that can be associated with certain mental disorders in humans, to determine the possibility of creating a new model of psychopathology. Our study included a study of some behavioral characteristics of male and female rats in the elevated plus maze, open-field test, object recognition test, social interaction test, sucrose preference test, latent inhibition test, Morris water maze, forced swimming test, acoustic startle reflex, and prepulse inhibition tests. We also determined the activity of the serotonergic, dopaminergic, and noradrenergic neurotransmitter systems in the hippocampus and frontal cortex by HPLC-ED. Concentration of norepinephrine, dopamine, DOPAC, serotonin, and HIAA, as well as DOPAC/dopamine and HIAA/serotonin ratios were determined. A correlation analysis of behavioral and neurochemical parameters in male and female rats was performed based on the data obtained. The results of the study showed that US PS altered the behavioral phenotype of the rat offspring. US PS increased the level of anxious behavior, impaired orientation-research behavior, increased grooming activity, decreased the desire for social contacts, shifted behavioral reactions from social interaction to interaction with inanimate objects, impaired latent inhibition, and decreased the startle reflex. US PS activated the serotonergic, dopaminergic, and noradrenergic neurotransmitter systems of the rat frontal cortex and hippocampus. A correlation between neurochemical and behavioral parameters was revealed. Our study showed that US PS leads to a certain dysfunction on behavioral and neurochemical levels in rats that is most closely associated with symptoms of schizophrenia or autism. We hypothesize that this could potentially be an indicator of face validity for a model of psychopathology based on neurodevelopmental impairment.",

        "abstract": "It is known that patients reporting chronic pain often experience trauma or post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and tend to be more difficult to treat. Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), a neurodevelopmental disorder, is frequently associated with chronic pain. Furthermore, patients diagnosed with ADHD are more likely to encounter trauma and develop PTSD because of their inattentive and impulsive tendencies. There are reports stating that atomoxetine (ATX), a selective noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor for ADHD, is effective in patients diagnosed with PTSD and ADHD. However, there have been no reports on cases of comorbid PTSD and ADHD with chronic pain, and ATX's potential in improving chronic pain coexisting PTSD. Furthermore, no reports have evaluated patient cerebral blood flow in conjunction with the course of treatment with ATX for chronic pain.\nIn this study, we reported a case where ATX improved chronic pain with PTSD and improved cerebral blood flow. The patient was a 56-year-old woman exhibiting chronic pain with PTSD, resulting from 6\u2009years of severe domestic violence from her common-law husband. She had no history of ADHD diagnosis, but through aggressive screening, comorbid ADHD was diagnosed. When treated with ATX, there were significant improvements in her pain, quality of life, anxiety, depression, catastrophic thoughts, and cerebral blood flow. As a result, she could resume work after 11\u2009years.\nThe study showed that chronic pain with PTSD may be comorbid with ADHD. Moreover, we found that ATX can improve chronic pain with PTSD and cerebral blood flow. Aggressive screening of ADHD is important because once the diagnosis of comorbidity is confirmed, an ideal ADHD treatment can be selected. Therefore, based on the results of this study, ATX may be a candidate for treatment for cases of chronic pain with PTSD and ADHD.",

        "abstract": "Our internal balance, or homeostasis, is threatened or perceived as threatened by stressful stimuli, the stressors. The stress system is a highly conserved system that adjusts homeostasis to the resting state. Through the concurrent activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and the locus coeruleus/norepinephrine-autonomic nervous systems, the stress system provides the appropriate physical and behavioral responses, collectively termed as \"stress response\", to restore homeostasis. If the stress response is prolonged, excessive or even inadequate, several acute or chronic stress-related pathologic conditions may develop in childhood, adolescence and adult life. On the other hand, earlylife exposure to stressors has been recognized as a major contributing factor underlying the pathogenesis of non-communicable disorders, including neurodevelopmental disorders. Accumulating evidence suggests that early-life stress has been associated with an increased risk for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and autism spectrum disorder in the offspring, although findings are still controversial. Nevertheless, at the molecular level, early-life stressors alter the chemical structure of cytosines located in the regulatory regions of genes, mostly through the addition of methyl groups. These epigenetic modifications result in the suppression of gene expression without changing the DNA sequence. In addition to DNA methylation, several lines of evidence support the role of non-coding RNAs in the evolving field of epigenetics. In this review article, we present the anatomical and functional components of the stress system, discuss the proper, in terms of quality and quantity, stress response, and provide an update on the impact of early-life stress on child development and behavior.",

        "abstract": "Early-life stress is associated with a high prevalence of mental illnesses such as post-traumatic stress disorders, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, schizophrenia, and anxiety or depressive behavior, which constitute major public health problems. In the early stages of brain development after birth, events such as synaptogenesis, neuron maturation, and glial differentiation occur in a highly orchestrated manner, and external stress can cause adverse long-term effects throughout life. Our body utilizes multifaceted mechanisms, including neuroendocrine and neurotransmitter signaling pathways, to appropriately process external stress. Newborn individuals first exposed to early-life stress deploy neurogenesis as a stress-defense mechanism; however, in adulthood, early-life stress induces apoptosis of mature neurons, activation of immune responses, and reduction of neurotrophic factors, leading to anxiety, depression, and cognitive and memory dysfunction. This process involves the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis and neurotransmitters secreted by the central nervous system, including norepinephrine, dopamine, and serotonin. The rodent early-life stress model is generally used to experimentally assess the effects of stress during neurodevelopment. This paper reviews the use of the early-life stress model and stress response mechanisms of the body and discusses the experimental results regarding how early-life stress mediates stress-related pathways at a high vulnerability of psychiatric disorder in adulthood.",

To investigate the functional consequences, we established patient variant (BCAT1: c.792T>A p.(Phe264Leu); c.1042G>A p.(Glu348Lys)) and BCAT1 knockout hiPSC models. Both disease models show profound defects in cortical neuron differentiation and neurite outgrowth. Furthermore, metabolic analysis revealed evidence of mitochondrial dysfunction associated with increased levels of tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle intermediates, glutamate, and glutamine. This increase is linked to altered oxygen consumption rates, superoxide production, and upregulation of UCP2 in BCAT1-disease neurons, suggesting a downstream impact on electron-transport chain homeostasis. These findings establish a regulatory role for BCAT1 in mitochondrial function and further define a role for genomic variants in BCAT1 in neurometabolic disorders.",

        "abstract": "Autism spectrum disorders are neurodevelopmental conditions that pose substantial diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. Maternal exposure to valproic acid (VPA) during pregnancy is a well-established risk factor associated with autism-like behaviors in offspring. This study characterized the metabolic phenotypes in the brain tissue of larval zebrafish following VPA exposure. Zebrafish were exposed to 4 \u03bcM VPA from 2 hours post-fertilization (hpf) until 4.5 days post-fertilization (dpf), and locomotor activity was assessed at 14 dpf. Comprehensive metabolomic profiling via ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) identified 2,613 metabolites in brain tissue, of which 50 showed potential links to autism (CTRL_CV < 15%, VPA_CV < 20%). Significant reductions were observed in the levels of glutamine, glutamate, and triacylglycerol (TG). Nile red staining confirmed profoundly decreased TG deposition in the dorsal telencephalon (pallium), habenula, and cerebellum of VPA-exposed zebrafish. Furthermore, in vivo imaging revealed attenuated fluorescence intensity in excitatory glutamatergic and inhibitory GABAergic neurons within the habenular nucleus and optic tectum, corresponding to reduced TG levels. Conversely, the cerebellar corpus (central cerebellar body) and inferior olive nucleus exhibited an increase in excitatory glutamatergic neurons and a reduction in inhibitory GABAergic neurons, indicating an excitatory/inhibitory (E/I) imbalance. Collectively, these findings suggest that VPA may promote autism pathogenesis by disrupting the glutamine-glutamate cycle and impairing triacylglycerol metabolism in the zebrafish brain. These findings offer novel insights into metabolic dysfunction in ASD and may facilitate the identification of potential diagnostic biomarkers.",

        "abstract": "Recent studies link intensive adolescent alcohol exposure to adult memory deficits and glutamatergic dysfunction, as shown in preclinical models of binge drinking. Adolescent stress exposure has also been associated with changes in emotional behavior and memory, varying with stress timing and intensity. This study demonstrates that repeated exposure to restraint stress (five sessions of 1.5h from postnatal days 32-36) can prevent memory deficits, but not anxiety, caused by intensive alcohol exposure (four weekly cycles of 3g/kg ethanol doses followed by three washout days) when assessed in adult animals (postnatal day 77). PCR analysis of hippocampal mRNA showed alcohol consumption reduced expression of growth factors (BDNF), glutamate receptor subunits (AMPA: GluR1, GluR2; NMDA: NR1, NR2A), and endocannabinoid signaling genes (CB2, PPAR\u03b1; DAGL\u03b1, DAGL\u03b2; FAAH, MAGL). Restraint stress largely reversed these biochemical changes, suggesting it protects against alcohol's long-term impact on the hippocampus by partially restoring glutamatergic synaptic function and normalizing glutamate receptor and endocannabinoid system expression. Proteomic studies in the dorsal hippocampus further reveal that early stress exposure modifies how adolescent alcohol affects dorsal hippocampal protein expression. These findings imply that early stress habituation could counteract neurodevelopmental changes affecting memory when induced by adolescent alcohol exposure. However, disruption of emotional behavior is still present in animals exposed to alcohol, independently of the stress delivered.",

        "abstract": "Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a chronic neurodevelopmental disorder characterised by inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity, significantly impacting life quality and mortality. It is among the most heritable neuropsychiatric disorders, yet its aetiology remains unclear, hindering the development of novel medications. Previously, research has primarily focused on the dopaminergic and noradrenergic systems using animal models. However, there is growing evidence for a role of the glutamatergic system in ADHD pathomechanisms, and a translational failure between pre-clinical animal models and human clinical trials. We therefore established and characterised a functional cortical neuronal model using human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) to investigate glutamatergic development in healthy controls and adult ADHD patients. hiPSCs from healthy controls and ADHD patients showed no difference in their capacity to form cortical neurons (CNs). However, CNs from ADHD patients showed an altered developmental pattern, characterised by changes in extracellular glutamate and decreased transcription of NEUN, PSD95 and EEAT2. Moreover, a significant ~50% reduction in vGLUT2 transcription was observed at multiple time points, suggesting a robust cellular disease endophenotype which might be suitable for future drug screening. Lastly, calcium imaging analysis revealed decreased synaptic signalling strength and frequency, indicating a hypoactive phenotype. In summary, we were able to establish a functional hiPSC-derived cortical neuronal model to investigate ADHD pathomechanisms, which revealed impaired glutamatergic development in ADHD individuals. Our results suggest that the glutamatergic system should also be a target for future drug development.",

        "abstract": "Neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) are chronic brain diseases linked to innate immune signaling abnormalities, affecting children with complex gut-brain axis etiologies and limited targeted therapies. While infant microbes/metabolites may predict childhood NDDs, their landscape and host-metabolism interactions in NDDchildren remain unclear.\nThis study enrolled 40 NDDchildren (mean age: 5.18 \u00b1 1.77, F:M = 11:29) and 60 healthy controls (HCs; mean age:5.11 \u00b1 1.42, F:M = 25:35) from Gansu Province Hospital Rehabilitation Center. Shotgun metagenomics and untargeted metabolomics was used to analyze gut microbiota and fecal/plasma metabolites, multi-omics integration analysis was performed to explore host-microbe interactions.\nClinically, NDD children showed self-care, concentration, and social behavior deficits, with grandparents as primary caregivers, versus parents in HCs. Microbiome analysis revealed reduced gut diversity and dysregulation in NDDs: depleted beneficial taxa including Akkermansia muciniphila and Lactococcus lactis, but enriched GABA/lactateproducing bacteria; and disrupted pathways included polysaccharides/fatty acids/amino acid/purine ribonucleosides metabolism. Fecal metabolomics identified 100 enriched metabolites including polyamines and GABA in 45 pathways and 254 depleted metabolites including bile acids and butyrate in 57 pathways. Plasma metabolomics showed 321 enriched metabolites like free fatty acids in 143 pathways and 270 depleted metabolites including glycerophospholipids in 84 pathways. Notably, phenolic acids, arginine/proline metabolism, and HIF-1 signaling were enriched in both feces and plasma of NDDs children. Benzene derivatives, indoles, steroid hormone biosynthesis, and tryptophan/tyrosine/phenylalanine metabolism were increased in plasma but decreased in feces, while oxidized lipids, amino acids and derivatives, metabolism of glycine/serine/threonine, alanine/aspartate/glutamate, and cysteine/methionine showed the opposite pattern. Venn analysis identified 29 common metabolites, with eight in KEGG maps. 11-dehydrocorticosterone, LPC (17:0/0:0), adipic acid, and sucralose were decreased in feces but increased in plasma; 1-methylhistidine and trigonelline were decreased in both; L-asparagine anhydrous was increased in feces but decreased in plasma; and sarcosine increased in both. Microbe-metabolite correlation analyses linked these metabolites to NDDs depleted species A. muciniphila, L. lactis, A. butyriciproducens, and etc.\nCollectively, our study presents the first integrated profile of gut microbiome, microbial metabolites, and host metabolome, reveals gut microbiota dysbiosis, functional impairment, and metabolic disturbance in pediatric NDDs. These findings provide a theoretical foundation for microbiotaand metabolite-targeted therapeutic strategies in childhood NDDs.",

        "abstract": "Brain excitatory-inhibitory (E-I) balance plays a fundamental role in sensory and social processing. Alterations in E-I neurotransmitter systems-commonly indexed by the glutamate and glutamine (Glx)/GABA ratio-have been implicated in various neurodevelopmental conditions, including autism spectrum disorder (ASD). However, how individual differences in E-I balance relate to sensory responsivity and autism-spectrum-related traits in neurotypical populations remains poorly understood. In this study, we evaluated E-I balance across sensory-related brain regions in 92 neurotypical participants to explore its association with sensory responsivity and autistic traits. Our findings revealed that individuals with higher levels of self-reported autistic traits also exhibited stronger associations with sensory responsivity and higher Glx/GABA ratios. In cross-correlation analyses, the Glx/GABA ratio was significantly associated with both autistic traits and sensory responsivity, whereas Glx alone showed fewer associations. Clustering analyses further grouped autistic traits with the Glx/GABA ratio, rather than with the individual metabolite concentrations, suggesting that the ratio may be more behaviorally relevant than either metabolite alone. Moreover, the prefrontal Glx/GABA ratio demonstrated stronger associations with both autistic traits and sensory responsivity compared to other brain regions, a finding further supported by hierarchical moderation and mediation analyses. Overall, these results suggest that individual variability in regional E-I balance may be meaningfully related to sensory and social-affective traits, even within non-clinical populations. These findings may offer insights into the broader neurobiological mechanisms underlying sensory-affective processing across the general population spectrum.",

        "doi": "10.1111/jnc.70223",
        "abstract": "Patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) may experience neurobehavioral and cognitive concerns, including psychiatric symptoms, due to the absence of full-length dystrophin (Dp427), frequently accompanied by deficiencies in shorter isoforms. The lack of dystrophin affects neurophysiological processes from the uterine phase, impacting neural circuitry in brain regions such as the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum. This leads to reduced inhibitory GABAergic transmission and altered hippocampal glutamatergic signaling. The resulting imbalance between inhibitory and excitatory inputs contributes to the neurodevelopmental and cognitive deficits observed in DMD. Recent studies have reported correlations between serum levels of D-aspartate and D-serine, endogenous ligands of glutamatergic receptors, and conditions such as schizophrenia, spinal muscular atrophy, and aging. Furthermore, in a recent clinical study, we reported a general dysregulation of D-/L-amino acids known to modulate glutamatergic neurotransmission in the serum of DMD patients, with significant correlations between muscle wasting, motor impairment, and alterations in L-glutamate levels and the L-glutamine/L-glutamate ratio. To delve deeper into this matter, we conducted an extensive neurochemical analysis using high-pressure liquid chromatography to measure the levels of the same D-/L-amino acids across various brain regions, the spinal cord, and serum of the mdx mouse model of DMD. Our results revealed a significant reduction in prenatal D-aspartate levels and postnatal levels of specific L-amino acids in the hippocampus of dystrophic mice compared to wild type. In adult mdx mice, we also observed a near-significant decrease in hippocampal D-serine levels and a significant reduction in spinal cord D-aspartate levels. This study provides the first evidence potentially linking D-/L-amino acid dysmetabolism in the hippocampus to the described neurophysiological alterations. Although further investigations are essential to validate this hypothesis, the mechanisms proposed here offer insight into how amino acid imbalances may contribute to the DMD-associated neurological and cognitive deficits, thus supporting the rationale for developing future targeted therapeutic strategies.",

Here, we report that common marmosets carrying FMR1 mutation, a non-human primate model for FXS, share common features in behavioral and molecular phenotypes with patients with FXS. Founder mutants with markedly reduced fragile X messenger ribonucleoprotein expression display hyperactivity, spontaneous seizures, and transcriptome changes in synapse-related genes that overlap with those reported in patients with FXS. Although spontaneous seizures in these mutants lead to postnatal lethality, the lethality is rescued by introducing mutations into the GRM5 gene, suggesting that elevated mGluR5 signaling contributes to the phenotype. F1 heterozygous females carrying a uniform mutation exhibit phenotypes associated with FXS, including alterations in vocal development and social preferences, electroencephalographic abnormalities, and impaired motor skills. Thus, female marmosets heterozygous for the FMR1 mutation represent a valuable translational model for investigating FXS mechanisms and potential therapeutic strategies.",

        "abstract": "The chromosome 15q11.2 locus is deleted in 1.5% of patients with genetic epilepsy and confers a risk for intellectual disability and schizophrenia. Individuals with this deletion demonstrate increased cortical thickness, decreased cortical surface area and white matter abnormalities. Human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived neural progenitor cells from 15q11.2 deletion individuals exhibit early adhesion junction and migration abnormalities, but later neuronal development and function have not been fully assessed. Imaging studies indicating altered structure and network connectivity in the anterior brain regions and the cingulum suggest that in addition to alterations in neural progenitor dynamics, there may also be structural and functional changes within discrete networks of neurons. To explore this, we generated human forebrain cortical neurons from iPSCs derived from individuals with or without 15q11.2 deletion and used longitudinal imaging and multielectrode array analysis to evaluate neuronal development over time. 15q11.2 deleted neurons exhibited fewer connections and an increase in inhibitory neurons. Individual neurons had decreased neurite complexity and overall decreased neurite length. These structural changes were associated with a reduction in multiunit action potential generation, bursting and synchronization. The 15q11.2 deleted neurons also demonstrated specific functional deficits in glutamate- and GABA-mediated neuronal network activity and synchronization with a delay in the maturation of the inhibitory response to GABA. These data indicate that deletion of the 15q11.2 region is sufficient to impair the structural and functional maturation of cortical neuron networks, and suggest an in vitro correlate to the pathologic changes in humans with the 15q11.2 deletion.",

        "abstract": "Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental condition increasingly linked to microbiota-gut-brain axis dysregulation, yet the causal microbial mediators and molecular mechanisms remain elusive. Based on our previously published ASD cohort, we discovered that depletion of Lactobacillus species in children with ASD correlates with exacerbated gastrointestinal symptoms and social deficits. Maternal immune activation (MIA) during pregnancy has been established as a critical environmental risk factor for ASD. Furthermore, in the MIA-induced ASD mouse model, we demonstrated that supplementation with Lactiplantibacillus plantarum, or its derived sodium benzoate (NaB), mitigates gut dysbiosis, alleviates deficits of social behavior, glutamate-glutamine levels, and neuronal activity in autistic mice. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed that NaB restored the genes expression, like Cxcl16, in astrocytes of autistic mice, which is linked to glutamate metabolic activity between neurons and astrocytes. Further, we demonstrated that astrocytes-specific Cxcl16 knock-in hippocampus bypassed microbiota effects to restore social memory in autistic mice. Recent investigations have established NaB as key mediator of histone lysine benzoylation (Kbz), primarily through its role in generating benzoyl-CoA, the essential substrate for this epigenetic modification. Mechanistically, through integrating RNA-seq and Cut & Tag analysis, our findings revealed that NaB boosts Cxcl16 gene expression in astrocytes, possibly by increasing H3K27 benzoylation binding at enhancer regions. This highlights the therapeutic potential of probiotics-derived NaB for ASD and uncovers a novel epigenetic mechanism within the microbiota-gut-brain axis.",

        "abstract": "Maternal obesity increases the risk of neurodevelopmental disorders and cognitive impairments in offspring later in life. Most animal studies investigated the effects of maternal high-fat diet (HFD) from pre-mating to lactation on offspring neurodevelopment and cognitive function. However, the specific impact of in-utero exposure to maternal HFD on the cognitive function in offspring remains limited. In this study, female dams were fed laboratory chow or HFD for 11 weeks: 8 weeks before conception and during gestation. To isolate the prenatal effects, newborns were reared by foster mothers under control-diet conditions during lactation. Behavioral tests were conducted between postnatal days 42 and 56. Our results demonstrate that maternal HFD exposure in utero impaired spatial working memory and spatial memory, and also caused depression-like behavior in offspring. These behavioral abnormalities were associated with reduced hippocampal NMDA receptor expression, diminished neurogenesis, and deficits in hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP). In addition, intrahippocampal microinjection of NMDA receptor antagonists that block NMDA ion channels or compete for glutamate binding effectively reduces hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP), resulting in deficits in spatial learning and memory. Furthermore, microinjection of NMDA into the hippocampus bilaterally activated NMDA receptor signaling, leading to the amelioration of behavioral abnormalities in HFD offspring. In summary, alteration of hippocampal NMDA receptors induced by prenatal maternal HFD exposure is associated with spatial learning and memory deficits in offspring.",

        "abstract": "Astrocytes, the most abundant glial cells in the central nervous system (CNS), play critical roles in blood-brain barrier (BBB) maintenance, synaptogenesis, neurotransmission, and metabolic regulation. In response to perinatal brain injury, astrocytes release inflammatory mediators that drive neuroinflammation, disrupting normal brain development. Key signaling pathways, including Janus kinase/signal transducers and activators of transcription (JAK/STAT), nuclear factor kappa B (NF-\u03baB), Notch, and glutamate transporter signaling, are activated during this process, contributing to astrocyte dysfunction and neuronal damage. Astrocytes also engage in dynamic crosstalk with microglia, oligodendrocytes, and neurons, further influencing the injury response. Biomarkers such as glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and calcium-binding protein (S100\u03b2) highlight astrocyte activation and its role in pathology. By targeting these signaling pathways and glial interactions, novel therapeutic strategies can be developed to mitigate neurodevelopmental and perinatal brain injuries associated with astrocyte dysfunction.",

        "abstract": "As a widely used pediatric anesthetic, sevoflurane presents a paradoxical neurodevelopmental risk during vulnerable brain maturation periods. This review synthesizes emerging evidence on sevoflurane-induced developmental neurotoxicity, with a focus on somatostatin (SST)-SSTR4 signaling and its downstream effects on synaptic integrity. Key findings reveal that sevoflurane exposure disrupts excitatory-inhibitory balance by upregulating hippocampal SST expression, suppressing glutamatergic synaptic markers (vesicular glutamate transporter 1 (vGLUT1), PSD95), and impairing cAMP/PKA signaling-a pathway essential for AMPA receptor trafficking and synaptic plasticity. Mechanistically, SSTR4 activation exacerbates synaptic dysfunction through adenylate cyclase (AC) inhibition, reducing cAMP levels and diminishing AMPA receptor phosphorylation. Primate and rodent models corroborate these effects, linking SST-SSTR4 dysregulation to long-term cognitive deficits. Single-nucleus RNA sequencing in macaques further identifies altered synaptic development genes after sevoflurane exposure. While preclinical data suggest SSTR4 modulation as a therapeutic target, causal relationships between sevoflurane, SSTergic signaling, and synaptic pathology remain unconfirmed. This work underscores the urgency of refining pediatric anesthesia protocols and developing neuroprotective strategies targeting the SST-SSTR4-cAMP/PKA axis. Future research should prioritize spatiotemporal profiling of SST dynamics, validation of SSTR4-specific interventions, and translational studies using non-human primate models to bridge mechanistic insights with clinical outcomes.",

        "abstract": "Citrin deficiency (CD) is a pan-ethnic autosomal recessive inborn error of metabolism due to-pathogenic variants in the SLC25A13 gene which results in disruptions of multiple metabolic pathways including glycolysis, gluconeogenesis, lipogenesis, the urea cycle, and tricarboxylic cycle.\nA retrospective observational study of CD patients managed according to standard clinical practice at a single centre in Singapore (KK Women's and Children's Hospital, KKH) was undertaken from August 2016-August 2024. We present the largest cohort of patients reported in Southeast Asia focusing on clinical, biochemical and imaging findings at diagnosis, and long-term outcomes/management (including drug therapy, food preferences/adherence, hospital admissions, growth, neurodevelopmental, biochemical, and imaging outcomes). We also explore the utility of newborn screening (NBS) as a means for early detection of CD.\nEighteen CD patients (9 males; 2 sibling pairs) majority of Chinese ethnicity (n\u00a0=\u00a016) with a median duration of follow up 5\u00a0years 5\u00a0months, participated in this study. Median age at first presentation and at diagnosis was 50\u00a0days and 82\u00a0days, respectively. Fourteen patients presented with neonatal intrahepatic cholestasis caused by CD (NICCD), 2 asymptomatic from sibling screens, and two from abnormalities on NBS (one presenting with unconjugated hyperbilirubinaemia and the other with cholestasis and liver failure). Two patients had liver failure (one from NICCD group and another from NBS group). None required liver transplantation. All symptomatic patients had raised citrulline and threonine-serine ratios at presentation. None of the patients was prescribed any regular concomitant medications except for MCT oil. No genotype phenotype correlation was observed. At final assessment, all patients showed normalisation of liver parameter, galactose and plasma amino acids. Abnormalities in lipid profile in 9 patients (age 5-16\u00a0years) showed borderline high total cholesterol (median 5.4\u00a0mmol/L) and LDL (median 3.0\u00a0mmol/L) which was on the higher end of the normal range. Sixty-six percent of patients liver imaging findings were normal or showed stable changes. Food preferences (assessed in \u22651-year olds) did not reflect a clear bias towards high protein/fat diet. Adherence appeared to improve with a more prescriptive approach, it waned with age (more so in dietary aspects versus the use of MCT oil). Hospital admissions were few (median 1/patient) and unrelated to CD. Overall improvements were seen in weight, height and BMI for age z-scores, showing median weight/height/BMI for age z-scores to be -0.72, -0.83, 0.08, respectively. None had neurodevelopmental concerns.\nCD remains challenging to diagnose biochemically at all ages. Current NBS strategies require further refining to increase pick up rates of CD. Cascade screening utilising genetic testing is recommended due to the presence of phenotypic heterogeneity among patients with the same genotype. However, in the absence of available genetic testing, CD should be considered in all children presenting with prolonged conjugated hyperbilirubinaemia in the presence of elevated ALP, total galactose, with/without transaminitis and typical PAA profile. With our standard treatment for CD, we observed: (i) normalisation of biochemical parameters, (ii) normalisation/stabilisation of liver imaging findings, (iii) improvements in weight/height/BMI for age scores. Adoption of a prescriptive approach appeared to encourage treatment adherence.\nThis retrospective study examines 18 patients with citrin deficiency at KK Women's and Children's Hospital in Singapore, the largest cohort reported in Southeast Asia. The study assesses clinical, biochemical, imaging findings, and outcome measures. Results showed improvements in growth, biochemical normalisation, and stable liver imaging with standard treatment (dietary adjustments and MCT oil). While NBS detected some cases, there remains a need for better screening strategies. This study also demonstrated a lack of genotype-phenotype correlation, suggesting that cascade screening utilising genetic testing are crucial for early diagnosis.",

        "abstract": "Prenatal nicotine exposure is linked to adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes, yet e-cigarette use during pregnancy continues to rise due to aggressive marketing efforts and misconceptions of safety. We investigated the effect of prenatal e-cigarette aerosol exposure on the migration of GABA neurons, a developmental process critical for the establishment of cerebral cortical circuitry. Pregnant mice were exposed to nicotine-containing aerosol (e-cigarette), nicotine-free aerosol (e-liquid) or room air (control) daily beginning 2\u00a0weeks before conception and continuing until gestational day 14. E-cigarette, but not e-liquid, aerosol significantly reduced GABA neuron density in the dorsal cerebral wall at rostral forebrain level and within the marginal zone, reflecting region-specific vulnerabilities. In vitro explant cultures revealed that nicotine dose-dependently reduced neuronal migration, and this effect was mimicked by a selective \u03b17 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) agonist. Blocking the \u03b17 nAChR using a selective antagonist attenuated the effects of nicotine on neuronal migration. These findings reveal a previously unrecognized vulnerability of GABA neuron migration to e-cigarette aerosol and identify \u03b17 nAChR activation as a mechanism for nicotine-induced impairment of GABA neuron migration. Moreover, the findings highlight the need for translational efforts to update clinical guidance and public policy regarding e-cigarette use during pregnancy.",

        "abstract": "Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by social and communication deficits, accompanied by restricted and repetitive behaviors. ASD is a lifelong condition that causes a heavy medical and societal burden. To date, there are no disease-modifying, mechanism-targeted treatments approved for core ASD symptoms. In human studies, loss-of-function mutations in the CACNA1H gene, which encodes the T type Cav3.2 calcium channel, have been associated with ASD. However, animal and molecular studies investigating the underlying mechanism in ASD patients with CACNA1H mutations are lacking. In this study, we performed a series of behavioral assays to phenotype the Cav3.2 systemic knockout (Cav3.2KO) mice. The Cav3.2KO mice exhibited ASD-like behaviors, including impaired social novelty, increased self-grooming behavior, and deficits in recognition and retrieval of fear memory. Notably, enhancing \u03b3-aminobutyric acid (GABA) signaling via administration a low-dose of clonazepam (CLZ) rescued these behavioral impairments in the Cav3.2KO mice. Furthermore, we found that the intrinsic GABA level was significantly reduced in the frontal cortex of Cav3.2KO mice, suggesting that GABA transmission was impaired in the Cav3.2KO mice. Together, our findings suggest that loss-of-function in the Cav3.2 channel contributes to ASD-like phenotypes through disrupted GABAergic signaling and that pharmacological enhancement of GABAergic signaling may offer a potential therapeutic approach for individuals with ASD carrying the CACNA1H mutations.",

        "doi": "10.1093/brain/awaf356",
        "abstract": "The neurotransmitter GABA activates G protein-coupled GABAB receptors (GBRs) that mediate neuronal inhibition in the brain. These receptors function as obligate heterodimers, consisting of the GB1 and GB2 subunits, with GB1 binding GABA and GB2 interacting with the G protein. The monoallelic variants p.A567T, p.S695I, and p.I705N in the GABBR2 gene, which encodes the GB2 subunit, have been associated with epileptic encephalopathy and Rett-like disorders. The clinical phenotypes overlap with those seen in individuals with monoallelic loss-of-function variants in GABBR1, the gene encoding the GB1 subunit. To investigate the effects of these GABBR2 variants on GBR function, we expressed the variants in heterologous cells and evaluated their pharmacological profiles using a luciferase reporter assay. Furthermore, we introduced the epileptic encephalopathy-associated p.I705N variant into the mouse Gabbr2 gene to examine its impact on neuronal and network activity. These mice were analyzed using proteomic approaches, in combination with in vitro and in vivo electrophysiological techniques. Finally, we evaluated whether the observed network alterations could be reversed pharmacologically. In heterologous cells, all variants displayed strong constitutive activity, reaching 50-100% of the maximal GABA-induced activity of wild-type receptors. This gain-of-function effect was evident regardless of whether the variants were expressed as individual subunits or as heterodimeric receptors. EEG recordings from Gabbr2I704N/+ mice revealed abnormal high-amplitude synchronization in the \u03b4 frequency band, without overt seizures. Electrophysiological recordings from brain slices confirmed an increase in constitutive activity in both pre- and postsynaptic GBRs, but also revealed a significant reduction in receptor responsiveness to agonists. Proteomic analysis of brain tissue further revealed a downregulation of both GB1 and GB2 subunits, along with several G protein signaling components. This downregulation likely serves as an adaptive response to the heightened constitutive activity, reducing not only the activity of the variant receptors but also the signaling of wild-type receptors. In vivo recordings from the auditory cortex of awake Gabbr2I704N/+ mice revealed reduced spontaneous neuronal activity and a slower decline in neuronal activity following auditory stimuli. Treatment with a positive allosteric modulator of GBRs normalized spontaneous network activity and the termination of neuronal activity after sensory stimulation in these mice. In conclusion, our findings indicate that the clinical phenotypes associated with constitutively active GABBR2 variants are driven by an adaptive downregulation of GBRs and their key signaling components. Therefore, in monoallelic individuals, positive allosteric modulators that enhance wild-type receptor activity may provide a promising therapeutic strategy.",

        "abstract": "Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental condition affecting 1 in 36 children, characterized by deficits in social communication and restricted, repetitive behaviors. Self-injurious behaviors (SIBs), such as head-banging and biting, are prevalent in ASD, affecting up to 50% of individuals. These behaviors pose significant risks, including physical injury and social isolation. While behavioural therapies are the first-line treatment, their effectiveness is often limited, necessitating the use of pharmacological interventions. However, there is a paucity of evidence regarding the effective pharmacological management of SIBs in this population. Gabapentin, an anticonvulsant also used for neuropathic pain, has shown potential in managing SIBs, despite limited evidence in pediatric populations thus far. It acts as a GABA analog, inhibiting voltage-dependent calcium channels. Gabapentin is generally well-tolerated, with mild adverse effects like fatigue and dizziness. In this report, we present a case detailing the use of gabapentin in a 13-year-old non-verbal male with ASD and severe SIBs. Despite extensive subspeciality evaluations and various treatments, his SIBs persisted, significantly negatively impacting his quality of life. Oral gabapentin was introduced and progressively titrated up to 600mg TID, leading to a notable reduction in the frequency and severity of SIBs within days. The patient's episodes became shorter and more manageable, with no adverse effects reported. This case highlights gabapentin's potential as an effective treatment for severe SIBs in pediatric patients with ASD, particularly when chronic pain is suspected as a contributing factor. Further research is warranted to explore its effectiveness in this population and establish guidelines for its use.",

        "abstract": "The dentate gyrus (DG), a crucial region of the hippocampus responsible for learning, spatial encoding, and memory formation, undergoes its main development and maturation after birth. Despite its importance, the regulatory mechanisms underlying postnatal DG development remain poorly understood. This study is aimed to investigate the role of H3 lysine 4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) and H3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) in the development and function of the postnatal DG. We show robust enrichment of H3K4me3 in the subgranular zone (SGZ), a primary neurogenic region, while high levels of H3K27me3 were mainly presented in granule cell layer. Enhanced H3K4me3 level facilitated proliferation and development of neonatal mouse neural stem cells (NSCs), promoted differentiation towards GABA neurons, as well as improved mouse spatial learning and memory. Enhancing H3K27me3 level exerts the opposite function, additionally promoting NSCs entry into a quiescent-like state. During the neuronal differentiation of NSCs, the integration of RNA-Seq and ChIP-Seq datasets reveals that H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 co-regulate the expression of genes essential for neural development, such as Gli1, through the formation of bivalent domains. Manipulation activation of the Shh/Gli1 pathway abolishes the effect of alterations in the levels of H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 in NSCs. Based on these findings, we propose that H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 serve as molecular \"switches\" to dynamically regulate NSCs proliferation and differentiation and in turn, influence the postnatal developmental progression of DG, additionally to provide potential therapeutic targets for treating diseases associated with abnormal hippocampal development. During dentate gyrus development in neonatal mice, the active transcription mark H3K4me3 and the repressive mark H3K27me3 are co-localized at the promoter regions of essential neurodevelopmental genes, and thus forming bivalent chromatin domains in neural stem cells. These domains serve as a \"molecular switch\" that regulates the dynamic processes of cell proliferation and differentiation. The enhanced ratio of H3K4me3 to H3K27me3 markedly upregulates the expression related genes, thereby promoting cell proliferation and neuronal differentiation, ultimately leading to improved spatial learning and memory. Conversely, decreasing this ratio has the opposite effect.",

        "abstract": "Variation in over 100 genes is now associated with increased risk for autism and related neurodevelopmental conditions, but how this variation results in distinct and overlapping behavioral changes is still not well understood. Recent efforts have focused on screening many autism genes at once for functional and phenotypic convergence, and identified subsets that are crucial for many early steps of neurodevelopment. Few studies have screened later steps of neurodevelopment, circuit function, circuit plasticity, or behaviors. We screened 20 conserved autism-associated genes for impact on experience-dependent neuron remodeling in Caenorhabditis elegans. Loss of unc-44/ANK2, set-4/KMT5B, daf-18/PTEN, gap-2/SYNGAP1, and chd-1/CHD2/8 increased, while unc-36/CACNA2D3 decreased, neurite outgrowth of the GABAergic DVB neuron in adults. Although daf-18/PTEN, set-4/KMT5B, and unc-44/ANK2 had convergent phenotypes, they arise from distinct temporal trajectories with differential impact on DVB presynaptic morphology. Screening for the DVB regulated spicule protraction behavior identified multiple autism genes involved, but only unc-44/ANK2 and unc-36/CACNA2D3 were shared between screens. Application of a metric geometry computational framework (CAJAL) to the DVB morphology dataset identified 5 additional genes that impact DVB morphology, including unc-2/CACNA1A and unc-10/RIMS1, which also significantly impacted behavior. This work defines new regulators and molecular mechanisms of experience-dependent neuron remodeling and circuit plasticity, and further links these processes with conserved autism genes. It also demonstrates the utility of using intact, behavior generating circuits in C. elegans, to screen for novel roles for conserved autism genes.",

Light and electron microscopy of Kirrel3-expressing GABA neurons suggests that they receive direct excitation from DG neurons and project onto CA3 dendrites.

        "abstract": "Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a complex neurodevelopmental condition, characterized by early-onset deficits in social interactions, communication, and repetitive behaviors. Dysfunction of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) neurotransmission during neural development has been implicated as a potential mechanism, particularly within the frontal cortex. This study aimed to investigate the effects of prenatal valproate (VPA) exposure on the sensorimotor reflexes, ultrasonic vocalization (USV), and GABAergic markers in the frontal cortex of male offspring. The morphology of primary cortical neurons isolated from control and prenatally VPA-exposed rats was also assessed. Significant sensorimotor developmental delays were observed in VPA-exposed male rats, evident from delays in negative geotaxis and righting reflex tests on postnatal Day 5. The recordings of USV calls showed significant decreases in both the total number of calls and average call duration. Increased gene expression of glutamate decarboxylase 2 (Gad65), vesicular GABA transporter (Vgat), GABAA receptor \u03b2 subunit 1 (Gabrb1), and Gabarap-like protein 1 (Gabarapl1) was found in the frontal cortex of VPA-exposed pups, indicating alterations in the GABAergic system. Total primary cortical neurons and parvalbumin-positive neurons from VPA-exposed pups showed reduced branching and shorter neurites, whereas GABAergic neurons exhibited increased arborization, and somatostatin-positive neurons showed no change. These findings suggest that prenatal VPA exposure alters cortical neuron morphology and GABAergic markers, potentially contributing to motor and early vocal communication impairments, which may explain the etiology of specific autistic symptoms.",

        "abstract": "Autism is characterised by core differences in social communication and interaction. The neurobiology underlying autism can be investigated using experimental designs that capture the dynamic nature of social perception, which activates the third visual pathway. Here, we investigated dynamic specific facial emotion processing using a naturalistic facial expression paradigm, leading to a specific dynamic N170 (dN170) evoked by emotion expression trajectories. Participants engaged in an active task of an avatar with two temporal trajectories: morphing from neutral to happy or sad expressions and unmorphing back to neutral. We recorded event-related potentials (ERPs) and magnetic resonance spectroscopy in autistic and non-autistic children and adolescents (n\u2009=\u200916 per group; ages between 8 and 17) matched for sex, handedness, and age. Results revealed that dN170 exhibited longer latencies during unmorphing for the autistic group. This specific timing effect, identified for the unmorphing versus morphing conditions in autism, suggests a stimulus trajectory-dependent effect (hysteresis). Dynamic P300 showed higher amplitudes in the autistic group during morphing, confirming the presence of an attentional compensatory mechanism. Correlations between ERP properties, GABA, and social communication abilities provided evidence of a dimensional continuum from non-autistic to autistic traits. These findings highlight the promising role of these ERPs as indicators of perceptual and attentional processing differences in autism.",

These macro-structural changes are parallel with developmental changes in brain neurochemistry, probed in the human brain using Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS). This includes neurotransmitters such glutamate and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), as well as building blocks of neuronal and associated tissue such as N-acetyl aspartate (NAA), and those involved in metabolism such as creatine (Cr). While previous research has linked MRS-measured neuro-metabolite levels to bulk tissue composition (e.g., gray matter, white matter, and cerebrospinal fluid), the relationship between neurochemistry and more granular macrostructural metrics, such as cortical thickness, area, volume, and local gyrification, remains unexplored. This study investigates the association between MRS-measured neuro-metabolite levels in the posterior parietal cortex (PPC) and PPC-voxel cortical macrostructural metrics in a developmental cohort of 86 individuals aged 5-35 years. We also examine whether PPC metabolite concentrations associate with whole-brain structural metrics to determine whether associations are region-specific or more broadly generalisable. Our findings reveal significant positive associations between PPC cortical thickness, volume, local gyrification index (LGI) and Glx (glutamate + glutamine) levels, likely because differences in cortical ",

        "abstract": "Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are neurodevelopmental disorders whose aetiology remains obscure. Multiple human and animal studies have shown that prenatal exposure to valproate increases the risk of ASD in children. Although the mechanisms implicated are still poorly understood, several hypotheses have been put forward; one being that the alteration of the prenatal hormonal milieu could be involved. Indeed, hormone disruption was observed in women with epilepsy or bipolar disorder treated with valproate with an increased risk of experiencing hyperandrogenism or an androgen-associated pathology such as polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) or diabetes. This could be explained by an inhibition of aromatase, the enzyme responsible for the aromatisation of androgens into oestrogens. Hormone disruption could impair neurodevelopment through the involvement of the orphan retinoic acid receptor alpha (RORA), a nuclear receptor whose expression is regulated by dihydrotestosterone (DHT) as well as estradiol, and whose transcriptional targets are implicated in ASD. Moreover, neuroestradiol is a key regulator of neurodevelopment and the effects of its disruption seem to overlap with the consequences of prenatal exposition to valproate. Finally, the onset of autism seems to be more frequent when pregnancies were affected by conditions hormonal disturbances such as obesity, diabetes, pre eclampsia or prematurity. This provides a better understanding of valproate-induced autism patterns and opens up new avenues of research to better understand the development of this disorder.",

        "doi": "10.3390/nu17193173",
        "abstract": "Caffeine is one of the most widely consumed psychoactive substances globally and is a common component of daily diets, particularly among women of reproductive age. Numerous in vitro and in vivo studies have indicated potential adverse effects of prenatal caffeine exposure, including disturbances in fetal growth, metabolic dysregulation, organ malformations, and neurodevelopmental alterations. These findings suggest that caffeine may influence multiple physiological pathways during gestation, including epigenetic modifications and metabolic programming. However, evidence from human studies remains heterogeneous and often inconclusive. Recent cohort studies and meta-analyses have reported that moderate maternal caffeine intake is not significantly associated with increased risks of gestational diabetes mellitus, gestational hypertension, or preeclampsia, although higher intake levels have been linked to anemia, preterm birth, and low birth weight in some populations. Furthermore, emerging data suggest potential associations between prenatal caffeine exposure and early neurodevelopmental outcomes, including behavioral changes, subtle structural brain differences, and alterations in offspring metabolic health and obesity risk. Despite these findings, the magnitude and clinical relevance of these effects remain uncertain, partly due to variability in caffeine sources, dosages, study designs, and reliance on self-reported intake. This review aims to synthesize current evidence on maternal caffeine consumption, its impact on pregnancy complications, fetal development, and long-term child health outcomes. By integrating experimental and clinical data, the study provides a comprehensive overview that may assist clinicians and healthcare professionals in counseling pregnant women regarding caffeine intake and potential risks.",

        "abstract": "Schizophrenia is a prevailing yet severely debilitating psychiatric disorder characterized by a convoluted etiology. Although antipsychotics have been available for over half a century, they primarily mitigate symptoms rather than providing definitive care. This limitation suggests that the neurotransmitter systems targeted by these medications are not the root cause of the disorder. Ongoing research seeks to elucidate the cellular, molecular, and circuitry pathways that contribute to the development of schizophrenia. Unfortunately, its precise pathogenesis remains incompletely understood. Accumulating evidence implicates dysregulated neurogenesis and aberrant neurodevelopmental processes as key contributors to disease progression. Recent advances in proteomics and imaging technology have facilitated the emergence of novel models of schizophrenia, emphasizing the roles of neuroinflammation, sex steroids, and cortisol. This paper aims to organize and map the intercorrelations and potential causal effects between various mechanistic models to gain deeper insight on how these mechanisms contribute to the cause, risks, and symptoms of the disorder. Furthermore, we discuss the potential therapeutic strategies that target these pathological pathways. Elucidating these mechanisms may ultimately advance our understanding of schizophrenia's etiological foundations and guide the development of curative interventions.",

        "abstract": "Gabapentin lactam (GBP-L), a transformation product of the anticonvulsant gabapentin, persists in surface waters at concentrations reaching \u03bcg/L levels due to its recalcitrance to conventional treatment processes. Despite growing concerns about pharmaceutical transformation products, their mechanistic toxicity pathways remain poorly characterized. Here, we used zebrafish embryo-larval models to investigate the neurodevelopmental effects of environmentally relevant GBP-L concentrations (8, 80, and 800\u202f\u03bcg/L). Exposure to GBP-L had no significant effect on the survival rate of zebrafish embryos, but significantly impaired the hatching process, increased the malformation rate, and inhibited body length development-with a 3.86\u202f% reduction in body length compared to the control group at 72 hpf and a 3.70\u202f% reduction at 144 hpf. Motor assessment revealed a concentration-dependent reduction in swimming activity. Meanwhile, transgenic imaging indicated a decrease in neuronal fluorescence intensity by 9.46\u202f%, alongside a reduction in axonal length of 7.84\u202f%. Mechanistic investigations demonstrated that GBP-L activates calcium signaling pathways, triggering intracellular Ca\u00b2\u207a overload that leads to mitochondrial dysfunction, increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and disrupted neurotransmitter homeostasis. Co-exposure with the calcium channel blocker verapamil significantly mitigated these effects, confirming calcium signaling as the molecular initiating event in GBP-L neurotoxicity. Transcriptomic analyses further validated the calcium-mitochondria-ROS cascade as the critical toxicity pathway. This study provides the first evidence that GBP-L, a persistent pharmaceutical transformation product, can disrupt neurodevelopment by perturbing calcium signalling at environmentally relevant concentrations, highlighting the need to establish a comprehensive risk assessment framework that includes transformation products.",

Fourteen studies met the eligibility criteria, which focused on original research assessing GM characteristics in individuals with ADHD. Selected articles comprised a total of 1319 participants, 67\u00a0% male, from Europe (53\u00a0%) and East Asia (47\u00a0%), mostly with children and adolescents aged 4-18 years. Alterations in microbial composition were observed among ADHD patients; including higher relative abundance of Agathobacter and Ruminococcus gnavus and decreased Faecalibacterium, identified in different studies. Results regarding alpha- and beta-diversity were inconclusive. There was also evidence of links between GM and inflammatory markers and neurotransmitter-related pathways.

        "abstract": "Stimulants such as methylphenidate (MPH) are the first-line pharmacological treatment for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Although stimulants are effective at a group level, individual response varies, which advocates for tailored treatment approaches. Prior studies suggested that neurobiological measures following a single dose of stimulants are indicative of longer-term clinical response. To expand these findings, we tested whether an association between acute and longer-term treatment response can also be identified using measures commonly used in clinic. Sixty adults with ADHD completed clinico-neuropsychological measures, including the Barkley Adult ADHD Rating Scale-IV (BAARS-IV) and the Quantitative behavior (Qb) test, following a single dose of MPH (20\u2009mg) and placebo. These measures were repeated after two-month MPH treatment to ascertain response. We tested associations between single-dose and longer-term response using univariate and multivariable (Lasso) regression approaches. We also ran correlations between predicted and true outcome measures. Univariate regressions showed significant associations between single-dose and two-month improvement in BAARS hyperactivity/impulsivity and Qb scores (all p\u2009<\u20090.001 but Qb activity, p\u2009=\u20090.006). Multivariable models including acute response and baseline clinicodemographic measures yielded significant correlations between predicted and actual values for all BAARS-IV and Qb scores at follow-up, except for BAARS inattention and Qb activity. Most had large/very large effect size (up to r\u2009=\u20090.69). These findings suggest that specific clinico-neuropsychological changes following a single dose of MPH may be indicative of longer-term treatment response, especially when combined with pre-treatment clinico-demographic characteristics. Once validated in larger and more heterogeneous samples, these results may support more informed and individualized treatment approaches for ADHD.",

        "abstract": "Neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental disorders represent a significant global health burden, characterized by progressive neuronal dysfunction and loss. Both diseases, despite their diverse etiologies and mechanisms, share a complex interplay of genetic, environmental, and biological factors. Neurodegenerative diseases are caused by multiple factors, including aging, mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, inflammation, genetic mutations, and protein misfolding. In contrast, neurodevelopmental disorders are primarily influenced by epigenetic alterations, neurotransmitter imbalances, early brain damage, environmental factors, and genetic variations. Despite extensive research, effective treatments remain unavailable due to the complexity of their pathologies and the biochemical pathways involved. A deep understanding of the complexities and individual differences associated with these disorders is crucial for developing effective treatments. In this background, this review provides a comprehensive overview of neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental disorders, including their clinical symptoms, etiology, pathogenesis, underlying mechanisms, potential drug targets, reported drugs, advanced treatment options, and challenges in the drug discovery process. This comprehensive literature review was conducted using databases such as PubMed and Scopus, focusing on research published up to April 2025. By understanding the complexities of these disorders, researchers can develop novel therapeutic approaches, including potential drugs and advanced treatment methods, to mitigate their devastating impact.",

        "doi": "10.1186/s12888-025-07349-3",
        "abstract": "Catatonia, including malignant catatonia, is a severe neuropsychiatric condition historically associated with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. However, recent diagnostic frameworks, such as the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, Text Revision (DSM-5-TR) and the International Classification of Diseases, 11th Revision (ICD-11), offer a broader understanding. These systems classify catatonia not as a standalone diagnosis but as a specifier that may occur alongside various psychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia spectrum disorders, mood disorders, neurodevelopmental disorders, or medical conditions. Although electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) and benzodiazepines are considered gold standard treatments for catatonia, many healthcare settings lack access to ECT, and certain physical conditions make ECT relatively contraindicated or a high-risk option. Guanfacine, a central adrenergic \u03b12A receptor agonist, has a similar mechanism of action as the sedative dexmedetomidine, which has shown efficacy in treating catatonia. However, the effectiveness of guanfacine in this context has not been tested.\nWe report five cases of catatonia (including malignant catatonia) associated with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. These cases were treated either in a psychiatric hospital or an outpatient clinic, both of which lacked access to ECT. Extended-release formulation of guanfacine was administered alongside temporary benzodiazepine use, and treatment outcomes were observed. All five patients were in syndromal remission from catatonia following treatment that included guanfacine in combination with other pharmacological interventions. Mild to moderate side effects were observed. These included dizziness and fatigue in one patient, and hypotension and bradycardia in two others. All adverse effects resolved with dose reduction. Complications of catatonia included impaired oral intake requiring nutritional support in two patients and urinary catheterization due to immobility in two patients.\nThese findings suggest that guanfacine may serve as a safe and effective alternative to ECT for catatonia in settings where ECT is unavailable or relatively contraindicated. The clinical courses also suggest that dysfunction of the central noradrenergic system may contribute to the pathophysiology of catatonia, and that guanfacine's selective \u03b12A adrenoceptor modulation may play a role in symptom improvement. Further research is needed to validate these findings and clarify the underlying mechanisms.",

        "abstract": "Schizophrenia is a debilitating, chronic neuropsychiatric disorder, a multifactorial disorder combining genetic, neurodevelopmental, immunological, and environmental factors. Common antipsychotic treatments may be effective against positive symptoms, but still lack when dealing with negative symptoms, cognitive defects, and side effects of medication. Recent innovations show how the gut-brain axis is an important modulator of neuropsychiatric health, identifying microbial dysbiosis as a cause of schizophrenia. This review examines the therapeutic potential of such treatments of probiotics, psychobiots, and postbiotics as an adjunctive or alternative treatment targeting the way of modulating neuroinflammation, neurotransmitter synthesis, experience, and maintenance of blood-brain barrier integrity. Probiotics, which are live beneficial microbes, have immunomodulatory and neuroactive effects; psychobiotics, a subclass that has specific mental effects, modify stress-response systems and neurotrophic factors. Postbiotics, consisting in turn of microbial metabolism like short-chain fatty acids, present improved safety and stability with anti-inflammatory and antioxidant functions. Available clinical and preclinical evidence suggests the ability of these agents to attenuate the symptoms of schizophrenia and cognitive impairment, as well as to increase the tolerability of treatment. Regarding the conclusive presumptions, however, strain-specific variability and inconsistent methodologies confined by the sparse large-scale trials limit them. New technologies of nanocarrier systems, artificial intelligence, and personalized microbiome profiling might provide the best precision of the therapy. In this review, pitfalls in mechanistic insights, progress reports on translational studies, and future research prospects are deconstructively examined to support microbiota-based interventions as promising paradigms of holistic schizophrenia management.",

        "abstract": "Organophosphate (OP) pesticide exposure, particularly during the prenatal period, is linked to adverse neurodevelopmental impacts in children. One commonly used agricultural OP pesticide, chlorpyrifos, was severely restricted in California in 2020 but other OP pesticides continue to be used.\nWe calculated the absolute change in agricultural OP pesticide applications (by weight) in California before and after the chlorpyrifos ban (2016-2021) and investigated the spatial and demographic patterns of OP applications within 1\u00a0km of residences during pregnancy for all births in California in 2021. Geocoded residential addresses from 2021 California birth certificates were linked with publicly available records of pesticide applications within 1\u00a0km. Kilograms of OP pesticides applied during the estimated duration of the pregnancy were proportioned based on the area of intersection between the 1\u00a0km buffer zone and land-use polygons with crop data.\nWe found a 54% decrease in overall kilograms of OP pesticide use in California between 2016 and 2021 following the chlorpyrifos ban in 2020. Despite this decrease, we found that 7.5% of all pregnant people in California who gave birth in 2021 lived within 1\u00a0km of agricultural fields where OP pesticides had been used during their pregnancy; in one county, more than 50% of pregnant people lived within 1\u00a0km of OP pesticide use. There were considerable disparities by race/ethnicity, age, and region, with Hispanic/Latine, younger people, and residents of the predominantly fruit and vegetable growing Central Coast region being most likely to live near OP pesticide applications during pregnancy.\nA high number of births statewide, particularly in high use counties, were to pregnant people who lived within 1\u00a0km of OP pesticide use at levels similar to those linked to adverse impacts for the child in epidemiologic studies. This suggests that regulatory changes to limit use or restrict applications in close proximity to residential areas could have a substantial public health benefit on children's brain development.",

        "abstract": "N-acetylcysteine (NAC), a cysteine derivative with a reactive thiol group, possesses antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. Its redox activity plays a central role in scavenging reactive oxygen and nitrogen species and modulating cellular signaling pathways. Recent research highlights its potential role in psychiatric disorders through the modulation of oxidative stress and inflammatory pathways. This narrative review examines the efficacy of NAC in treating psychiatric conditions, including mood disorders, schizophrenia, anxiety disorders, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), obsessive- compulsive disorder (OCD), substance use disorders (SUDs), and neurodevelopmental disorders. A comprehensive search of PubMed, Scopus, Embase, PsycINFO, and Google Scholar databases was conducted for studies published between March 1, 2007, and December 30, 2024. The search utilized keywords related to NAC and psychiatric disorders. Data were critically analyzed to evaluate NAC's therapeutic potential. Preclinical studies demonstrate NAC's benefits in reducing oxidative stress, inflammation, and modulating neurotransmitter systems. Animal models of depression, schizophrenia, and OCD show symptom reduction through glutamatergic and antioxidant mechanisms. Clinical trials reveal NAC's efficacy as an adjunct in treating major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia, particularly for negative and cognitive symptoms. Evidence for anxiety disorders, PTSD, and OCD is limited but suggests anxiolytic and anti-obsessive effects. In SUDs, NAC shows promise in reducing cravings and substance- seeking behavior, while preliminary findings in autism suggest improvements in irritability and hyperactivity. NAC exhibits potential as an adjunctive treatment for various psychiatric disorders due to its safety profile, low cost, and broad mechanisms of action. However, clinical results are mixed, highlighting the need for larger, well-designed trials to confirm its efficacy and define optimal dosing strategies.",

        "abstract": "The mechanisms of age-related differences and innovative intervention strategies for cognitive dysfunction in hemodialysis patients are crucial for enhancing patient outcomes. This research thoroughly examined the varying pathological aspects of cognitive decline across different age groups. Children and adolescents experience heightened permeability of the blood-brain barrier during critical developmental phases, along with the disruptive effects of uremic toxins on neurotransmitters and synaptic plasticity, which result in diminished white matter integrity and abnormal functioning of the default mode network. Additionally, genomic variations, such as harmful CNVs, coexist with the central nervous system's high plasticity and susceptibility. In contrast, elderly patients face cognitive impairment due to the combined effects of vascular diseases (like small vessel disease and impaired cerebral blood flow regulation) and Alzheimer's-like pathology, exacerbated by dialysis-related hypotension, oxidative stress, and inflammation, which further contribute to reduced cerebral blood flow and neurodegeneration. Consequently, a life cycle-based layered intervention strategy is suggested: children should focus on safeguarding their neural development through collaborative gene-environment interventions and neural stem cell transplants, while elderly patients require standardized treatment for vascular diseases and comorbidities, including Alzheimer's disease. Evidence indicates that incremental dialysis, low temperature dialysis, and high-dose hemodiafiltration can significantly reduce inflammation and oxidative stress markers, slow cognitive decline across all ages, and offer new insights for targeted nephrology management due to their universal effects. Future multi-center cohort studies are necessary to confirm the long-term advantages of age-specific interventions and to support the development of personalized precision treatment systems.",

        "abstract": "Metabolism is critical for neurodevelopment, yet the mechanisms by which endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) contribute to neurodevelopmental disorders remain poorly defined. Using a rat model, we investigated hippocampal metabolomic responses at postnatal day 6 following maternal exposure to six structurally diverse EDCs (bisphenol F, permethrin, butyl benzyl phthalate, triphenyl phosphate, perfluorooctane sulfonic acid, and DINCH) from pre-mating through lactation. Targeted steroid, thyroid, and neurosteroid hormones, neurotransmitters, and untargeted lipidomics were profiled to map disrupted pathways. The analysis revealed sex-specific, chemical-specific, and shared metabolic signatures of developmental neurotoxicity. Key affected endpoints across chemicals included corticosterone, pregnenolone sulfate, and N-acylethanolamine lipids, confirming hormonal disruption while uncovering novel non-EATS (estrogen, androgen, thyroid, and steroidogenesis) pathways and mechanisms of action. These findings provide new insights into EDC-mediated disruption of hippocampal development and identify potential molecular biomarkers that may support future mechanistic research and chemical risk assessment.",

A key histological hallmark of FCD type II is the presence of cytomegalic dysmorphic neurons (CDNs), which are considered to be major contributors to cortical network hyperexcitability. However, the relatively low frequency of CDNs within resected lesions has challenged their unbiased molecular characterization. Here, we leverage deep learning approaches to objectively map key anatomical compartments of FCD IIb and guide regional spatial transcriptomic profiling.

        "abstract": "The steroid hormone cortisol plays crucial roles in innate stress response, downregulation of inflammation, and promotion of glucose homeostasis. Infants born extremely preterm may be prone to cardiovascular compromise and inflammation-mediated respiratory disease due in part to insufficient cortisol production. Current data show that hydrocortisone, the exogenous medication form of cortisol, may help prevent or treat complications associated with relative adrenal insufficiency, although the full balance of treatment risks and benefits is uncertain. Prophylactic administration of hydrocortisone beginning in the first 1-2 postnatal days in extremely preterm infants likely results in earlier initial weaning from invasive ventilation and may reduce in-hospital mortality and the composite outcome of death or bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). However, such use may increase the risk of sepsis in infants born less than 26 weeks' gestation and gastrointestinal perforation with concurrent exposure to indomethacin. Whether prophylactic hydrocortisone affects childhood neurodevelopment has not been adequately studied. Initiation of hydrocortisone after the first postnatal week in infants receiving invasive ventilation promotes successful extubation but does not affect risks of mortality, BPD, or neurodevelopmental impairment. In extremely preterm infants with hypotension, hydrocortisone can increase blood pressure, but short- and long-term safety for this indication and usefulness compared to other anti-hypotensive agents are not well established.",

        "abstract": "Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common neurodevelopmental disorder in children, characterized by persistent inattention, hyperactivity and impulsivity. Dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis has been proposed as one neurobiological mechanism, yet findings across individual studies are inconsistent.\nTo quantify differences in HPA-axis function between children under 18 years with ADHD and typically developing (TD) controls across multiple biological markers. TD children were defined as having no diagnosis of ADHD or any other psychiatric or neurodevelopmental disorder.\nA systematic review and random-effects meta-analysis of studies published from 1999 to 2025 was performed following PRISMA guidelines. Searches of PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, SpringerLink, CNKI, Wanfang, VIP and CBM identified studies reporting adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), basal cortisol (saliva or blood), cortisol awakening response (CAR), stress-reactive cortisol or hair cortisol concentration (HCC). Pooled effect sizes were expressed as standardized mean differences (SMDs) with 95\u202f% confidence intervals (CIs). Heterogeneity was assessed with the I\u00b2 statistic; publication bias was examined using funnel plots and Egger's test.\nThirty-four studies (n\u202f=\u202f4635; 2559 ADHD, 2076 TD) met inclusion criteria. Compared with TD controls, children with ADHD had significantly lower morning awakening cortisol (SMD = -0.63, 95\u202f% CI -0.93 to -0.34), 30-min post-awakening cortisol (SMD = -0.39, 95\u202f% CI -0.54 to -0.23), afternoon cortisol (SMD = -0.85, 95\u202f% CI -1.63 to -0.06) and post-test cortisol (SMD = -2.14, 95\u202f% CI -3.93 to -0.34). No group differences emerged for ACTH, CAR, pre-test cortisol or HCC. Subgroup analyses showed larger effects in blood versus saliva matrices and in studies from China; the hypocortisolemic profile was most pronounced in the hyperactive-impulsive (ADHD-HI) subtype. Meta-regression identified no significant moderators, and no evidence of publication bias was detected.\nADHD may exhibit a consistent pattern of HPA-axis hypoactivity, affecting both basal secretion and stress responsiveness, whereas ACTH, CAR and HCC appear preserved. The effect is strongest in the ADHD-HI subtype and when cortisol is measured in blood, indicating a subtype-specific and matrix-dependent neuroendocrine phenotype. These findings may support HPA-axis dysregulation as a potential biological correlate of ADHD.",

While much attention has been paid to genetic and neurodevelopmental factors, emerging evidence highlights the crucial role of the endocrine system in modulating social, cognitive, and behavioral outcomes associated with ASD. To systematically review the existing literature on endocrine dysfunction and hormonal signaling pathways implicated in ASD, with the aim of identifying common mechanistic links and evaluating their clinical relevance.A comprehensive literature search was conducted across PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar for studies published between 1980 and 2024. The review included 183 human studies evaluating associations between ASD and hormonal alterations, encompassing thyroid function, HPA axis dysregulation, growth hormone signaling, sex hormones, obesity, melatonin, oxytocin, vitamin D status, and exposure to endocrine-disrupting chemicals. Alterations in multiple endocrine axes were consistently associated with ASD, including prenatal thyroid imbalances, cortisol rhythm dysregulation, aberrant IGF-1 levels, elevated fetal steroidogenic activity, and impaired oxytocin signaling. Endocrine disruptors such as phthalates and pesticides were also linked to increased ASD risk in susceptible populations. Endocrine dysfunctions are frequently associated with ASD, with multiple hormonal axes potentially influencing its pathophysiology, although causality remains unconfirmed. Understanding hormonal influences across developmental stages could inform early detection strategies and novel therapeutic approaches.",

Data on corticosteroid treatment were collected from medical records, and the cumulative doses of hydrocortisone and dexamethasone were calculated. Cognitive outcomes at 6.5 years were assessed using a standardized test of intelligence, and the associations with corticosteroid therapy were evaluated.\nTwentynine (44 %) children were treated with corticosteroids, 18 with hydrocortisone, 3 with dexamethasone, and 8 with hydrocortisone and dexamethasone. The mean Full-scale (FSIQ), Performance (PIQ) and Verbal (VIQ) Intelligence Quotients did not differ significantly between children treated with corticosteroids and those not treated at 6.5 years. The incidence of cognitive impairment (FSIQ, PIQ and VIQ < 85) was higher in children treated with corticosteroids than in those not treated.

        "abstract": "Standard glucocorticoid (GC) replacement therapy in autoimmune Addison's disease (AAD) fails to replicate natural cortisol rhythms. Despite adherence, patients report persistent fatigue, reduced vitality, and impaired wellbeing, ultimately lowering health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Cortisol is essential for sleep regulation, yet the impact of cortisol imbalance on sleep and HRQoL in AAD remains poorly understood. This study investigates self-reported sleep impairments and their associations with fatigue and HRQoL in young adults with AAD.\nSixty-four patients with AAD and 128 healthy controls completed validated questionnaires assessing sleep (Karolinska Sleep Questionnaire), fatigue (Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory), and HRQoL (Short Form-36).\nPatients reported significantly more non-restorative sleep (p\u2009=\u20090.015) than controls. While overall rates of clinically relevant sleep impairments were similar, patients more frequently experienced awakening difficulties (p\u2009=\u20090.011) and struggling to stay awake (p\u2009=\u20090.036). Patients also reported poorer physical health (p\u2009<\u20090.001) and greater general fatigue (p\u2009=\u20090.007), with female patients experiencing more mental fatigue (p\u2009=\u20090.013). Poor sleep and fatigue were associated with reduced HRQoL across the cohort, with patients showing a more pronounced decline in physical health in relation to these factors. Mental health scores remained similar between groups.\nNon-restorative sleep emerged as a distinct feature of AAD. While the prevalence and severity of sleep impairments were similar to controls, the association with poorer physical health was stronger in patients. Mental health remained similar despite sleep disturbances. These findings highlight the importance of addressing even modest sleep disturbances, which may worsen fatigue and reduce physical wellbeing in AAD.",

Despite being highly prevalent, diagnosis of ADHD continues to rely on subjective assessment reports of behavior and is often delayed or inaccurate. This review summarizes current advances in biomarkers and neuropsychological tests for the improvement of ADHD diagnosis and treatment. Key biomarkers are neuroimaging methods (e.g., structural and functional MRI), electrophysiological measures (e.g., EEG, ERP), and biochemical measures (e.g., cortisol, vitamin D). Additionally, novel experimental measures, e.g., eye-tracking, pupillometry, and microbiome analysis, hold the promise to be objective and dynamic measures of ADHD symptoms. The review also comments on the impact of the burden of ADHD on quality of life, e.g., emotional well-being, academic achievement, and social functioning. Additionally, differences between individuals, such as age, sex, comorbidities, and the impact of social and family support, are also addressed in relation to ADHD outcomes. In summary, we highlight the potential of these emerging biomarkers and tools to revolutionize ADHD diagnosis and guide personalized treatment strategies.

        "abstract": "Prenatal stress is increasingly recognized as a critical factor influencing fetal brain development, with potential long-term risks for neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders. This review explores the effects of prenatal stress on the fetal brain, with particular emphasis on sex differences and the interplay between genetic, epigenetic, and environmental factors. The activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis in response to maternal stress leads to increased levels of glucocorticoids, which can cross the placenta and alter fetal brain structure and function. Key regions affected include the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, and amygdala, which are crucial for emotional regulation, memory, and cognitive function. Sex differences play a significant role in fetal stress responses, with males exhibiting greater vulnerability to adverse prenatal conditions. Studies suggest that male fetuses exposed to high maternal cortisol levels exhibit alterations in brain connectivity, increased amygdala volume, and heightened stress reactivity, whereas female fetuses may show adaptive mechanisms that confer resilience. Additionally, maternal nutritional status influences fetal neurodevelopment, with both undernutrition and obesity contributing to structural and functional changes in the fetal brain. Advances in neuroimaging techniques, including high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and placental diffusion imaging have provided valuable insights into how prenatal stress affects fetal brain connectivity. Epigenetic modifications, such as DNA methylation and histone modification, are implicated in the long-term programming of stress responses. Furthermore, early-life interventions, including maternal social support and mindfulness-based therapies, may mitigate the adverse effects of prenatal stress on offspring neurodevelopment. Given the profound impact of prenatal stress on fetal brain development, early identification of at-risk populations and the implementation of targeted interventions are crucial. Future research should integrate findings from neuroscience, genetics, and endocrinology to develop preventive strategies that improve neurodevelopmental outcomes and reduce the burden of stress-related disorders in later life.",

        "abstract": "Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a complex neurodevelopmental condition marked by substantial sex differences in prevalence, with males more frequently diagnosed than females. While genetic and environmental factors contribute to ASD, there is growing evidence that sex-specific endocrine pathways, particularly those involving sex hormones, may play a critical role in ASD etiology. This study aimed to investigate the functional network robustness and annotations of autism spectrum disorder genetic risk candidates (ASD-GRCs), with a focus on endocrine pathways and their impact on network connectivity. Using data from the Simon's Foundation Autism Research Initiative (SFARI) and functional network analysis via the STRING database, we assessed the connectivity of ASD-related genes by randomly subtracting sets of genes from the whole ASD gene network in subsets associated with androgen-testosterone, estrogen-progesterone, and other hormone pathways. Our findings reveal a significant \"sex-over-chance\" association, with androgen- and estrogen-related gene subsets showing marked connectivity within the ASD gene network compared to non-sex hormone genes. These results suggest that sex hormones may uniquely influence ASD-related neural development, providing support for the \"female protective effect\" and the androgen-driven model of ASD. Additional analyses of other hormonal pathways, such as oxytocin and cortisol, showed a lower connectivity impact, reinforcing the distinctive role of sex hormones in ASD. This study highlights the potential of endocrine-focused genetic analysis in understanding ASD, emphasizing sex-specific biological mechanisms that may inform future diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.",

        "abstract": "Alcohol use remains common in pregnancy with prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) associated with a plethora of adverse outcomes, including impaired emotional regulation and stress reactivity. Prior preclinical studies and emerging clinical evidence indicate that PAE affects the fetal hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis via the maternal-fetal interface in the placenta; however, little is known about the effect of these alterations on neurodevelopmental outcomes. We earlier reported on the effect of PAE and maternal stress on HPA axis biomarkers in placenta and umbilical cord (UC) blood; in the current study, we examined the effect of HPA axis biomarkers on infant neurodevelopmental outcomes at 6-9\u2009months of term-equivalent age. Participants in the Ethanol, Neurodevelopment, Infant and Child Health (ENRICH-2) prospective cohort were followed from the second trimester of pregnancy until infants were 6-9\u2009months of term-equivalent age. Maternal alcohol use was assessed through prospective interviews and a battery of ethanol biomarkers; maternal stress, by a Perceived Stress Scale (PSS). Placenta and UC blood specimens were collected shortly after birth, flash frozen, and analyzed for mRNA and protein expression of placental corticotropin-releasing hormone (pCRH), hydroxysteroid 11-beta dehydrogenase types 1 and 2 (HSD11B1, HSD11B2) and corresponding proteins (11\u03b2-HSD1 and 11\u03b2-HSD2), and Nuclear receptor subfamily 3 Group C Member 1-alpha (NR3C1-\u03b1) and corresponding glucocorticoid receptor alpha. UC plasma cortisol and cortisone levels were measured with ELISA. Bayley Scales of Infant Development, fourth edition (BSID-4; Motor, Language, Cognitive scores) and Infant Behavior Questionnaire Revised (IBQ-R; Surgency, Orienting/Regulation, Negative Affect) assessed neurodevelopment at 6-9\u2009months of term-equivalent age. Pearson correlation was used to examine associations between placental HPA axis biomarkers and neurodevelopmental outcomes overall and after stratification by group (Alcohol/Control). Multivariable linear regression assessed the independent effect of placental biomarkers and Alcohol\u2009*\u2009biomarker interactions on infant outcomes after adjusting for Alcohol and maternal stress. Participants (32 Alcohol and 68 Controls) were comparable in sociodemographic characteristics. Activation of the placental HPA axis was correlated with a decrease in BSID-4 scores among Controls and an increase in IBQ-R scores (Surgency and Negative Affect) among Alcohol participants. In multivariable analyses, the HSD11B2/HSD11B1 ratio was associated with a decrease in Cognitive scores, and the Alcohol\u2009*\u2009pCRH interaction was associated with a decrease in Orienting/Regulation and an increase in Surgency and Negative Affect (all p's\u2009<\u2009.05), after adjusting for Alcohol and PSS. A significant independent effect of PSS was also observed on infant motor skills, Orienting/Regulation, and Negative Affect. This is the first clinical study to characterize the role of placental HPA axis biomarkers and maternal psychosocial stress in PAE-induced changes on infant neurodevelopment, highlighting the importance of a \"placenta-brain axis\". We demonstrated that the effects of mild-to-moderate PAE on infant neurobehavior were observed in participants with the highest quartile of pCRH expression, emphasizing the role of placental biomarkers in PAE-induced effects.",

Postpartum depression is also associated with neurodevelopmental delays, possibly via altered parental attachment. While prenatal and postpartum mental health may be correlated, their relative and independent impacts on offspring neurodevelopment remain unclear. This study examines the effects of prenatal and postpartum anxiety and/or depression on neurodevelopmental delay at 24\u00a0months.\nIn a nationwide prospective cohort from the \"Assessing the Safety of Pregnancy in the Coronavirus Pandemic\" study, prenatal anxiety (GAD-7), prenatal depression (PHQ-9), and six-week postpartum depression (EPDS) were assessed. Childhood neurodevelopment was measured using the Ages and Stages Questionnaire, 3rd edition (ASQ-3). Logistic regression tested associations between moderate-to-severe maternal anxiety/depression and neurodevelopmental delay, adjusting for participant age, education, household income, and residential density. Alcohol, nicotine, anxiety/depression medication use during pregnancy, and preterm birth were considered as moderators/mediators.\nOffspring of participants experiencing both prenatal and postpartum moderate-to-severe anxiety or depression (N\u00a0=\u00a062) had a higher risk of neurodevelopmental delay at 24\u00a0months compared to those who experienced neither (N\u00a0=\u00a01060) with an adjusted risk ratio of 1.88 (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). While delay risk was higher in offspring of those with only prenatal (N\u00a0=\u00a0218) or postpartum (N\u00a0=\u00a045) anxiety/depression, these were not statistically significant.\nHaving both moderate-to-severe prenatal and postpartum anxiety or depression independently increased the risk of developmental delay at 24\u00a0months, even after adjusting for confounders. Further research is needed to explore underlying mechanisms linking maternal mental health and fetal neurodevelopment.",

        "abstract": "In the case of a suspected genetic disease, it is a big challenge to integrate the wide range of symptoms, to select the appropriate diagnostic steps and then to evaluate the results. In this case report, we present the medical history of a boy with congenital heart defects, neurodevelopmental and endocrine disorders. In connection with recurrent, psychomotor developmental delay, detection of minor anomalies and recurrent, severe sepsis since his birth, we started his genetic testing. Multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA-) analysis identified MECP2 duplication syndrome. This genetic syndrome, also called X-linked intellectual disability syndrome Lubs-type, is an X-linked recessive genetic defect. The exact frequency of this genetic disorder is unknown. We know about 200 people in the world, based on literature data. The severity of the clinical symptoms is related to the size of the duplicated chromosome segment. In our patient the affected region, in addition to MECP2, also contained SLC6A8, IDH3G, L1CAM, IRAK1, FLNA, GDI1, DKC1, F8 and VAMP7 genes. These genes may have contributed to the appearance of the diverse clinical picture. We emphasize the pathological role of the reduced cortisol response in the background of recurrent, severe septic conditions. A wide spectrum of genetic testing methods is available, but it depends on the clinician to initiate them. Our main goal with this announcement is to draw attention to these special analyses, which can shorten the diagnostic path, therefore during the next pregnancis the prenatal genetic diagnosis is possible.

This study explored the behavioural, physiological, and epigenetic consequences of early-life stress in a population of homeless rescue kittens. This longitudinal study included 50 kittens rescued and placed into foster care by the Prince Edward Island Humane Society. They underwent behavioural testing at 8, 10, and 12 weeks of age. Hair cortisol concentration was measured at 8 weeks and served as a physiological marker of the previous 3 months' cumulative stress response, which, for these kittens, included the late gestation period. A blood sample for relative telomere length measurement was taken at 10-12 weeks to estimate epigenetic changes as young kittens. Data were analyzed with respect to age and performance in all repeated measures tests, status as a stray or a surrender, and the presence of the dam in their foster homes. As expected, the performance of kittens in all tests changed over the 5 weeks of testing. Kittens separated from their mothers exhibited significantly higher hair cortisol concentrations (",

        "abstract": "Very preterm infants are at higher risk of long-term neurodevelopmental and psychiatric impairments, including anxiety. Prematurity is also linked to altered programming of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, associated with stress-related diseases. The cortisol awakening response (CAR), marked by a rapid cortisol increase after waking, is a biomarker of HPA reactivity and is linked to psychiatric disorders. This study aimed to evaluate for the first time the CAR in adults born very preterm and to explore its association with anxiety and stress. Twenty-five young adults born very preterm and 24 age- and sex-matched term-born controls collected saliva samples on two consecutive mornings at 0, 30, 45, and 60\u2009min after awakening. Anxiety was measured using the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, and stress was assessed with the Perceived Stress Scale. The CAR was analyzed using the sample at 0\u2009min (S1), total cortisol output (AUCg), and actual CAR (AUCi). There were no significant differences in AUCi. The preterm group exhibited lower S1 levels and a reduced AUCg. Preterm-born participants reported higher trait anxiety and stress, though no consistent link with the CAR was identified. Findings suggest long-term neuroendocrine changes in adults born very preterm, warranting further research. Clinical Trial Registration: Duetsche Register Klinischer Studien (DRKS): 00020235.",

        "abstract": "Children with autism and their parents face daily challenges that may be stressful for both. However, little is known about biological stress (hair cortisol concentrations [HCC]) in these families and its connection to children's health outcomes. This study investigates biological stress in children with autism and their parents and its associations with child mental health, eating behavior and BMI. Stress was measured in 102 young children with autism and their parents (101 mothers, 86 fathers) using HCC and self-reported parenting stress (OBVL). Child mental health was measured through autism symptoms (ADOS-2, SRS-2) and problem behavior (CBCL). Child eating behavior (CEBQ) and BMIz were also measured. Children with autism had higher HCC than their peers. Child HCC was not linked to mental health, eating behavior, or BMIz. Maternal stress (self-reported and HCC) was associated with child problem behavior. In fathers, self-reported parenting stress correlated with child autism symptoms (SRS-2) and behavior problems. Both parents' self-reported stress was associated with child eating behavior, specifically emotional undereating and overeating. In conclusion, higher HCC levels in children with autism in comparison to children from the general population, suggest differences in stress-regulation in children with autism. Given these findings, monitoring HCC in research and clinical practice could improve our understanding of stress-regulation in children with autism. The association between parental stress and children's mental health and eating behaviors, underscores the importance of considering family dynamics in clinical (preventive) interventions and in further research that addresses the mental and physical health of children with autism.",

        "abstract": "People with schizophrenia (SZ) and bipolar disorder (BD) show abnormalities in the biological stress system and low-grade inflammation. However, whether the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis-immune regulation is disrupted in SZ and BD, is yet to be determined.\nCortisol and C-reactive protein (CRP) were measured in blood samples collected at or before 10\u202fam in participants with SZ (N\u202f=\u202f257), BD (N\u202f=\u202f153), and healthy controls (N\u202f=\u202f40). Cortisol/CRP ratio was calculated as an indicator of the balance between HPA axis activity and inflammatory activity, called HPA axis-immune regulation. Global functioning and symptom levels were obtained using the Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) Scale and Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS). Standardized neuropsychological tests were used to assess cognitive function. All analyses were adjusted for demographic variables (age and sex) and the time of blood sampling.\nParticipants with a SZ or BD diagnosis had lower cortisol/CRP ratios (F=5.93, p\u202f=\u202f0.003) compared to healthy controls. The difference was no longer statistically significant (p\u202f>\u202f0.1) when BMI was added as a covariate to the model. Within patients, those on psychotropic treatment (n\u202f=\u202f337) had lower cortisol/CRP ratio than those not taking psychotropic agents (n\u202f=\u202f59) (F=4.72, p\u202f=\u202f0.03). Compared to HC, only patients on regular psychotropic agents had lower cortisol/CRP ratio (p\u202f=\u202f0.02). Within the SZ group, lower cortisol/CRP ratio was associated with having poorer general functioning as measured by GAF (\u00df=-0.18, p\u202f=\u202f0.01), and more severe negative and general symptomatology as measured by PANSS (\u00df=0.19, p\u202f=\u202f0.007 and \u00df=0.18, p\u202f=\u202f0.01, respectively). In SZ, lower cortisol/CRP ratio was also associated with poorer verbal memory, learning, and processing speed (\u00df=-0.20 p\u202f=\u202f0.007, \u00df=-0.19 p\u202f=\u202f0.01, \u00df=-0.25, p\u202f>\u202f0.001, respectively). No associations were observed between cortisol/CRP ratio and clinical and cognitive functioning in the BD group.\nThese findings may indicate HPA axis-immune dysregulation in SZ. Our study further indicates that disrupted HPA axis-immune regulation in people with SZ and BD is associated with psychotropic treatment and fat mass, highlighting the clinical importance of weight control and regular psychotropic treatment follow-ups within this group.",

The primary outcome is time alive and free of inotropes/vasopressors, censored at 7 days. Secondary outcomes include 28-day mortality, survival free of organ support, PICU length of stay, quality of life, functional status and neurodevelopmental vulnerability at 6 months post-enrollment, and hospitalization-related costs. Statistical analysis will be based on an intention-to-treat principle. The study has ethical approval (HREC/20/QCHQ/69922, dated December 21, 2020), is registered in the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ACTRN12621000247875), commenced recruitment on December 8, 2021, and is expected to finish recruitment by mid-2026.\nDissemination of the results will occur through publication in peer-reviewed journals, presentations at international conferences, and additional consumer-informed pathways.",

        "abstract": "Prenatal stress, mediated by elevated glucocorticoid (GC) levels, is a relevant modulator of fetal brain development and a known risk factor for neurodevelopmental disorders. Using the avian embryo as a vertebrate model, we injected corticosterone into the yolk on embryonic day 6 (E6) and assessed neurodevelopmental outcomes at day 14 (E14). Through deep proteomic profiling - quantifying over 6500 proteins - we uncovered a robust molecular signature of stress-induced disruption. Key myelin-associated proteins (myelin basic protein [MBP], PLP1, 2',3'-cyclic-nucleotide 3'-phosphodiesterase [CNP]) were markedly downregulated, indicating impaired oligodendrocyte maturation. These proteomic shifts were corroborated by immunohistochemistry and qPCR. Pathway-level analysis pointed to altered MAPK and AKT signaling as putative mediators of the observed phenotype. Our findings mirror previous mammalian data while highlighting the avian model's unique suitability for mechanistic dissection of prenatal stress effects. This study offers new insight into how early GC exposure impairs glial development, with broader implications for understanding the molecular origins of stress-linked brain vulnerability.",

However, the mechanisms underlying increased susceptibility to stress-related neurological disorders remain unclear. This study aimed to investigate the brain vulnerability after repeated neonatal sevoflurane exposure in rats to future traumatic stress exposure.P5 male Sprague - Dawley rats were exposed to 3% sevoflurane for 2\u00a0h daily from P6 to P8. Bumetanide, an NKCC1 inhibitor, was administered intraperitoneally before sevoflurane exposure. The expression of NKCC1 in the hippocampus at P8 was detected by reverse transcription -polymerase chain reaction and Western blot analysis. The brain vulnerability to stress exposure was assessed at P14-20 by conditioned fear traumatic stress model. The stress response was assessed by measuring serum corticosterone level. Primary hippocampal neurons of neonatal rat were cultured in vitro and exposed to sevoflurane with or without bumetanide pretreatment. The growth activity, intracellular LDH enzyme activity, ROS levels and apoptosis of hippocampal neurons were determined. Repeated neonatal sevoflurane exposure in rats enhanced serum corticosterone secretion after fear conditioning training and induced deficits in fear extinction training and recall.Pretreatment with bumetanide reversed these effects. In cultured primary neonatal rat hippocampal neurons, sevoflurane exposure enhanced the expression of NKCC1, increased the markers of neuronal cytotoxicity and downregulated the expression of Noggin, Drebrin and MAP2. In contrast, pretreatment with NKCC1 inhibitor bumetanide attenuated these adverse effects in vitro. Our results suggest repeated neonatal sevoflurane exposure enhances stress-related neurological susceptibility in rats by upregulating NKCC1, highlighting NKCC1 as a potential therapeutic target for anesthesia-induced neurodevelopmental vulnerability.",

        "doi": "10.1007/s11033-025-11029-6",
        "abstract": "Fluoride is an essential trace element primarily known for its role in preventing dental caries; however, excessive exposure can lead to adverse health effects. Emerging research suggests possible links between fluorosis and neurodevelopmental disorders, including reduced cognitive function and increased prevalence of ADHD. Its impact on liver health such as hepatotoxicity and hormone-related infertility also raises concern. Moreover, high fluoride exposure has been associated with various toxicities, including skeletal fluorosis, reproductive toxicity, and neurotoxicity, potentially driven by mechanisms involving oxidative stress and DNA damage. Recent studies have emphasized the critical role of epigenetic mechanisms in mediating fluoride's toxic effects. Epigenetics refers to stable yet reversible changes in gene expression that do not involve alterations in the DNA sequence, such as DNA methylation, histone modifications, and non-coding RNA regulation. Fluoride toxicity can disrupt normal methylation patterns and induce histone modifications, leading to abnormal expression of genes involved in apoptosis, oxidative stress, and inflammatory pathways. Additionally, microRNAs have been implicated in fluoride-induced reproductive dysfunction and neurotoxicity. In this review article, we provide a comprehensive overview of the evidence on the mechanism of fluoride-induced fluorosis, reproductive toxicity, and neurological impairment. We elaborate on current and future treatments, highlighting promising epigenetic drug candidates for managing fluoride toxicity. Understanding the epigenetic landscape of fluoride toxicity opens new avenues for therapeutic interventions, primarily targeting DNA methylation and histone modification pathways to mitigate its adverse health effects.",

        "abstract": "The central nervous system (CNS) is particularly vulnerable to endocrine-disrupting chemicals, especially bisphenol analogues. Bisphenol A (BPA), a widely studied compound, has been associated with various neurological disorders, leading to restrictions on its use and the subsequent adoption of alternative chemicals such as 4-hydroxy-4'-isopropoxydiphenylsulfone (BPSIP). However, concerns regarding the potential neurotoxicity of BPSIP have emerged. To evaluate the effects of BPSIP on neural development, zebrafish were exposed to a gradient of concentrations (0.05\u00a0mg/L, 0.5\u00a0mg/L, 5\u00a0mg/L) for 96\u00a0h post fertilization. Our results demonstrated that BPSIP exposure induced dose-dependent neurobehavioral abnormalities, including hypoactivity and reduced swimming distance. Furthermore, early-life exposure to BPSIP resulted in impaired brain morphology and increased neurocyte apoptosis. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that BPSIP exposure significantly disrupted neural development and function, particularly through modulations of the stress response and neurotransmitter-related pathways. Metabolomic profiling further confirmed these findings, showing significant alterations in dopaminergic and serotonergic neurotransmitter pathways in the BPSIP-treated larvae. Additionally, quantitative real-time PCR analysis of gene expression along these pathways corroborated the RNA-seq data. Our study findings provided compelling evidence that BPSIP exposure during early zebrafish development induced neurodevelopmental deficits through mechanisms such as apoptosis, energy metabolic dysfunction, and neurotransmitter disruption, even at environmentally relevant concentrations. These findings offer critical insights into the neurotoxic potential of emerging bisphenol analogues and underscore the need for further investigation into their impact on neural health.",

        "abstract": "Tylosin, a widely used veterinary macrolide antibiotic, raises environmental concerns due to its persistence and potential health risks. However, the neurotoxic effects of chronic low-dose tylosin exposure remain unclear. This study assessed the neurotoxicity of chronic exposure to environmentally relevant tylosin concentrations (5000\u202fng/L) in adult zebrafish. Behavioral tests indicated anxiety- and depression-like behaviors, including reduced exploration and increased freezing. Histopathology revealed neuronal degeneration, evidenced by decreased Nissl staining in key brain areas. Transcriptomic analysis identified significant changes in genes related to neuroinflammation, synaptic dysfunction, immune response, and steroid metabolism. Multi-omics approaches further showed substantial alterations in gut microbiota composition and metabolic profiles, particularly involving tryptophan metabolism and steroid hormone synthesis. These gut changes correlated with impaired intestinal barrier function, including fewer goblet cells and reduced tight junction and mucin-2 protein expression. Fecal microbiota transplantation confirmed the role of altered gut microbiota in inducing anxiety- and depression-like behaviors, highlighting microbiota-gut-brain axis involvement. Molecular docking identified microbial metabolites (MG 20:4, 2E-dodecenedioic acid, Ononin) interacting with critical neurodevelopmental and stress-response proteins (LRAT, BHLHE40, HSPA5), potentially linking microbiota shifts to brain dysfunction. Our results demonstrate that chronic environmental tylosin exposure induces neurotoxicity through gut dysbiosis and compromised intestinal barriers, disrupting essential neuroactive pathways. These findings emphasize the importance of considering microbiota-gut-brain axis disruption in environmental antibiotic risk assessments.",

        "abstract": "Bisphenol A (BPA), a prevalent endocrine-disrupting chemical, is widely found in various consumer products and poses significant health risks, particularly through hormone receptor interactions, oxidative stress, and mitochondrial dysfunction. BPA exposure is associated with reproductive, metabolic, and neurodevelopmental disorders. Melatonin, a neurohormone with strong antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, has emerged as a potential therapeutic agent to counteract the toxic effects of BPA. This review consolidates recent findings from in vitro and animal/preclinical studies, highlighting melatonin's protective mechanisms against BPA-induced toxicity. These include its capacity to reduce oxidative stress, restore mitochondrial function, modulate inflammatory responses, and protect against DNA damage. In animal models, melatonin also mitigates reproductive toxicity, enhances fertility parameters, and reduces histopathological damage. Melatonin's ability to regulate endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and cell death pathways underscores its multifaceted protective role. Despite promising preclinical results, human clinical trials are needed to validate these findings and establish optimal dosages, treatment durations, and safety profiles. This review discusses the wide range of potential uses of melatonin for treating BPA toxicity and suggests directions for future research.",

        "abstract": "Growth hormone (GH) is secreted by the anterior pituitary gland under the control of hypothalamic neuroendocrine neurons that express somatostatin or growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH). Ghrelin, originating primarily in the stomach, is also an important GH secretagogue. GH stimulates the hepatic secretion of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and the expression of IGF-1 in extra-hepatic tissues, including the brain. Many regions of the brain express receptors for GH, IGF-1, and ghrelin. In recent decades, evidence from both human and animal studies has indicated that GH, IGF-1, and ghrelin regulate numerous brain functions. Alterations in the secretion or sensitivity to these hormones may represent risk factors for developing neurodegenerative diseases (e.g., Alzheimer's and Parkinson's) and neuropsychiatric conditions (such as depression, anxiety, posttraumatic stress disorder, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder). Additionally, classical neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism spectrum and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder may also be influenced by somatotropic hormones. This review aims to summarize and discuss the emerging role of GH and IGF-1 in influencing brain function and the predisposition to brain diseases and neuropsychiatric disorders.",

        "abstract": "Environmental toxicants are increasingly prevalent worldwide and associated with numerous neurodevelopmental and psychiatric health outcomes. Exposure to these toxicants, particularly during gestation and the early postnatal period, alters maternal and offspring stress responses, inflammation, and behavioral outcomes. Oxytocin (OT) and arginine vasopressin (AVP) are highly conserved neuropeptides with myriad roles in the regulation of social behavior, stress responses, and more. While developmental stress is well known to impact OT and AVP systems, a growing body of literature suggests that early-life exposure to toxicants also impacts OT and AVP system development. Here we review the evidence demonstrating that perinatal exposures to environmental toxicants program developmental trajectories of the OT and AVP systems. Perinatal exposure to flame retardants, pesticides, plastics, and air pollution induces a variety of changes to OT and AVP systems in the brain, affecting the neuropeptides themselves as well as their primary central receptors, the oxytocin receptor (OTR) and the vasopressin receptor 1a (V1aR), respectively. Next, we discuss two biological mechanisms of action that may underlie the effects of toxicant exposure on OT and AVP: endocrine disruption and maternal immune activation. Finally, we explore key factors that promote either risk or resilience to toxicant exposures, including psychosocial experience, sex, the gut microbiome, and dosage/timing of exposures. Cumulatively, the literature reviewed suggests that preventing psychosocial stress to mothers during the perinatal period while promoting positive psychosocial experiences may lessen the impact of toxicants on offspring outcomes. Furthermore, the gut microbiome may be an important intermediary, and therefore target for intervention, between toxicant exposures and OT and AVP systems in the brain.",

There was a significant increase in the ratio of the pro-inflammatory interleukin-10 (IL-10) to the anti-inflammatory interleukin-6 (IL-6) for the no DEX group at the end of the procedure when compared to the DEX group (10 \u00b1 9 vs. 5 \u00b1 4, P = 0.04). When looking at the Bayley cognitive composite score, the DEX group scored better than the no DEX group during the second visit (102 \u00b1 11 vs. 88 \u00b1 17, P = 0.023). By the fifth visit, the two groups scored similarly (94 \u00b1 12 vs. 94 \u00b1 12, P = 0.9 for the no DEX and DEX groups, respectively).\nWhen looking at the neurodevelopmental outcome, both groups had no significant changes in their Bayley scores from baseline with blunting of most stress markers. This study offers possible evidence of the safety of early extubation after pediatric cardiac surgery while maintaining the goal of neuroprotection.",

        "abstract": "Endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) are widespread environmental contaminants that interfere with hormonal regulation, affecting metabolism, reproduction, neurodevelopment, and overall health. This review presents an overview of recent evidence on the health effects and biological mechanisms of EDCs, with a focus on their impact on hormonal balance and quality of life. An integrative literature review was conducted using 28 peer-reviewed articles published between 2020 and 2025, retrieved from databases such as PubMed, Scopus, and ScienceDirect. The selected studies explored the physiological and pathological effects of EDCs in humans. Compounds, such as bisphenol A, phthalates, and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), can mimic or block hormones, disrupt endocrine signaling pathways, and bioaccumulate in tissues. Exposure, especially during critical developmental windows, is linked to metabolic disorders, infertility, neurodevelopmental delays, and hormone-sensitive cancers. Common exposure sources include food, air, household dust, water, and personal care products. Key mechanisms of action involve receptor binding interference, oxidative stress, and epigenetic alterations. EDCs pose a significant and growing threat to public health, warranting urgent regulatory measures, increased public awareness, and continued research to mitigate long-term health consequences.",

Thus, understanding the molecular mechanism controlling mitochondrial dynamics in differentiating neurons is crucial to prevent the prenatal stress-induced impairments in behavior. We investigated the interplay between mitochondrial transport and fusion/fission in differentiating neurons exposed to prenatal stress, leading to ensuing behavior impairments, and then tried to identify the primary regulator that modulates both phenomena.\nWe used primary hippocampal neurons of mice exposed to prenatal stress and human induced-pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived neurons, for investigating the impact of glucocorticoid on mitochondrial dynamics during differentiation. For constructing mouse models, we used AAV vectors into mouse pups exposed to prenatal stress to regulate protein expressions in hippocampal regions.\nWe first observed that prenatal exposure to glucocorticoids induced motility arrest and fragmentation of mitochondria in differentiating neurons derived from mouse fetuses (E18) and human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs). Further, glucocorticoid exposure during neurogenesis selectively downregulated Miro1 and increased Drp1 phosphorylation (Ser616). MIRO1 overexpression restored mitochondrial motility and increased intramitochondrial calcium influx through ER-mitochondria contact (ERMC) formation. Furthermore, we determined that the N-terminal GTPase domain of Miro1 plays a critical role in ERMC formation, which then decreased Drp1 phosphorylation (Ser616). Similarly, prenatal corticosterone exposure led to impaired neuropsychiatric and cognitive function in the offspring by affecting mitochondrial distribution and synaptogenesis, rescued by Miro1\nPrenatal glucocorticoid-mediated Miro1 downregulation contributes to dysfunction in mitochondrial dynamics through Drp1 phosphorylation (Ser616) in differentiating neurons.",

To date, only one case with a PPP5C variant has been reported, associated with a severe neurological phenotype, including microcephaly, failure to thrive, and early-onset seizures.\nWe report a 12-year-old girl affected by epilepsy and learning disorders. At the age of five, she presented convulsive status epilepticus with respiratory failure at onset and she started anticonvulsant therapy with Levetiracetam with a significant improvement. Genetic analysis revealed a de novo heterozygous missense variant of PPP5C gene (c.202\u00a0C\u2009>\u2009T: p.Arg68Cys), which had not been previously described in the literature.\nThis case expands the phenotypic spectrum associated with PPP5C variants, highlighting the potential role of this gene inneurological disorders.

        "abstract": "Prenatal stress (PNS) is a significant risk factor impacting the lifelong health of offspring, and it has been widely recognized as being closely linked to the increased prevalence of neurodevelopmental disorders and psychiatric illnesses. However, effective pharmacological interventions to mitigate its detrimental effects remain limited. Melatonin (Mel), an endogenous hormone, has demonstrated considerable potential in treating neurological diseases due to its anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and neuroprotective properties, as well as its favorable safety profile and broad clinical applicability.\nThis study aims to investigate the protective effects and mechanisms of melatonin on neurodevelopmental and behavioral abnormalities in offspring induced by prenatal stress.\nUsing a prenatal stress mouse model, we evaluated the effects of melatonin on emotional and cognitive deficits in offspring. Neurogenesis and synaptic development were assessed, and RNA sequencing was performed to analyze microglial gene enrichment and immune-related pathways. Both in\u00a0vivo and in\u00a0vitro experiments were conducted to validate the findings, focusing on the PI3K/AKT/NF-\u03baB signaling pathway in microglia.\nMelatonin administration alleviated emotional and cognitive deficits in offspring mice exposed to prenatal stress, addressing abnormalities in neurogenesis and synaptic development. Additionally, RNA sequencing revealed that melatonin suppresses microglial gene enrichment and the upregulation of immune-related pathways. Both in\u00a0vivo and in\u00a0vitro validation indicated that melatonin modulates the PI3K/AKT/NF-\u03baB signaling pathway in microglia, reducing the elevated expression of CXCL10 in the dentate gyrus, thereby restoring normal neuro-supportive functions and optimizing the neurodevelopmental environment.\nThese findings suggest that melatonin significantly improves neurodevelopmental disorders and behavioral abnormalities caused by prenatal stress by inhibiting pathological microglial activation and promoting hippocampal neurogenesis and synaptic plasticity. This provides new insights into melatonin's potential as a neuroprotective agent for treating prenatal stress-related disorders.",

        "abstract": "Brain development involves the sequential expression of vulnerable biological processes including cell proliferation, programmed cell death, neuronal migration, synapse and functional unit formation. All these processes involve gene and activity-dependent events that can be distorted by many extrinsic and intrinsic environmental factors, including stress, microbiota, inflammatory signals, hormonal signals and epigenetic factors, hence leading to disorders born in the womb that are manifested later in autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) and other neurodevelopmental disorders. Predicting and treating such disorders call for a conceptual framework that includes all aspects of developmental biology. Here, taking the high incidence of ASDs as an example, we first discuss the intrinsic limitations of the genetic approach, notably the widely used twin studies and SNPs. We then review the long list of in utero events that can deviate developmental sequences, leading to persistent aberrant activity generated by immature misplaced and misconnected neuronal ensembles that are the direct cause of ASD. In a clinical perspective, we suggest analysing non-genetic maternity data to enable an early prediction of babies who will develop ASD years later, thereby facilitating early psycho-educative techniques. Subsequently, agents capable of selectively silencing malformed immature networks offer promising therapeutic perspectives. In summary, understanding developmental processes is critical to predicting, understanding and treating ASD, as well as most other disorders that arise in the womb.",

However, how early stress modification of brain development contributes to this pathophysiology is poorly understood. Ventral forebrain regions such as dorsal striatum are of particular interest: dorsal striatum modulates movement and cognition, is altered in NDDs, and has a primarily GABAergic population. Here, we examine effects of prenatal stress on adult movement, cognition, and dorsal striatum neurobiology in mice using striatal-dependent behavioral assays, immunohistochemistry, embryonic ventral forebrain transcriptomics, and placental transcriptomics. We found prenatal stress affected adult procedural, habit, and reversal learning in sex-specific ways. Stress also increased adult dorsal striatal GABAergic neurons - an effect largely driven by males. We sought to examine the developmental origins of these adult brain changes. We found similar sex-specific dorsal striatal cellular changes in earlier points of development. The dorsal striatum primordium--embryonic ventral forebrain-showed that prenatal stress increased DNA replication and cell cycle pathways in male but not female transcriptomics and cellular biology. Unique signatures may have arisen from male-female placental differences. Stress-induced placental transcriptomics showed upregulated morphogenesis pathways in males while females downregulated morphogenic, hormonal, and cellular response pathways. Our findings suggest that prenatal stress could affect placenta function and also alter the GABAergic population of dorsal striatum differentially between the sexes.",

BP analogues with phenol rings linked via hydrophobic segments (\"chain:alkaneBranch_neopentyl_C5\") disturbed stress response, leading to embryonic lethality, and introducing hydrophobic groups on the meta position of bisphenol structure augmented their embryonic lethality effects. \"3DACorr_TotChg_3\" of BP analogues is a key physicochemical feature for behavioral disorders, and BP analogues with 3DACorr_TotChg_3 value < 0.11 could induce hyperactive behavior by perturbing neurodevelopment relevant biological pathways.

The retina is part of the nervous system; however, the impacts of prenatal stress on retinal neurogenesis and visual function remain unclear. This study examined how elevated prenatal glucocorticoid levels differentially affect retinal development in the offspring of pregnant mice exposed to chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS). Offspring were classified into control, stress-resilient, and stress-susceptible groups based on behavioral tests assessing spatial memory and depression-like behaviors. The stress-susceptible group exhibited significantly altered synaptogenesis, reduced ganglion cell development, decreased retinal thickness, and visiual impairment. These mice also showed a pervasive transformation of retinal astrocytes into a proinflammatory A1-like reactive state, evidenced by increased GFAP and decreased STAT3 expression levels. This astrocyte phenotype shift coincided with disruptions in neurogenesis and synaptic formation. Furthermore, prenatal exposure to exogenous corticosterone confirmed that the effects of prenatal stress are mediated by glucocorticoid-induced retinal neurodegeneration. Our findings suggest that elevated prenatal glucocorticoid levels trigger a series of neurodevelopmental disturbances leading to retinal neurodegeneration and vision impairment. This research highlights the impact of prenatal stress on retinal development and visual health, suggesting new avenues for understanding and potentially mitigating the negative effects of early-life stress on neurodevelopment.",

        "abstract": "To examine movement behavior with stress-related biomarkers alongside self-reported mental health issues in adolescents with neurodevelopmental disorders (NDD).\nOne hundred fifty-one adolescents with clinically diagnosed NDD and aged between 12 and 17 yr were recruited in Hong Kong secondary schools. Salivary cortisol as a stress-related biomarker and self-reported mental health variables including anxiety, depression, and stress were collected. Physical activity (PA) levels (light PA [LPA], moderate PA [MPA], moderate-to-vigorous PA [MVPA], and vigorous PA [VPA]) and sedentary behavior [SB] were measured using a tri-axial waist-worn accelerometer. Data were analyzed using bootstrapping regression models (bias-corrected method), adjusted for age, gender, and body mass index.\nA significant negative association between MPA and MVPA with self-reported stress and a negative association between MVPA and self-reported anxiety were observed in adolescents with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). A significant positive association between SB and salivary cortisol and a negative association between VPA and salivary cortisol in adolescents with comorbid autism spectrum disorder (ASD)-ADHD were observed.\nStudy results demonstrated the association of PA levels and SB with mental ill-being, including stress-related biomarkers in both adolescents with ADHD and comorbid ASD-ADHD. Participation in PA, in particular at MVPA intensity, may be essential for mitigating mental health issues in this population. Alternatively, our results could show that mitigating stress and mental health issues is critical for PA participation in adolescents with NDD.",

This case highlights systemic challenges, including delayed diagnosis and unnecessary surgical referrals.We present an 8-year-old girl diagnosed with Van Wyk-Grumbach syndrome, characterized by severe hypothyroidism, isosexual precocious puberty, and ovarian hyperstimulation. She exhibited symptoms including vaginal bleeding, abdominal distention, and marked obesity with stunted growth. Investigations revealed severe hypothyroidism (TSH: 96 mU/L) and enlarged bilateral ovarian cysts. After initiating levothyroxine therapy, the patient demonstrated remarkable clinical improvement, including reduced abdominal swelling and normalizing thyroid function. This case underscores the importance of considering hypothyroidism in differential diagnoses of ovarian masses in children, especially in regions lacking newborn screening protocols, to prevent unnecessary surgical interventions and ensure appropriate management of the condition.",

        "abstract": "Tetramethyl bisphenol F (TMBPF) is being increasingly used as a Bisphenol A (BPA) substitute, particularly as a coating material for food and beverage cans. Unlike BPA, TMBPF is considered safe because of the lack of reported estrogenic effects, and it is often marketed under the \"BPA-free\" label. Initial cell-based assays and rat toxicity studies indicated much lower systemic and sex hormone-related toxicity of TMBPF compared with BPA, which has facilitated its substitution and significant market expansion. Since 2021, however, a growing body of research has reported various adverse effects of TMBPF across multiple biological systems. These include cytotoxicity associated with apoptosis and endocrine-disrupting effects on the thyroid axis, skeletal system, neurodevelopment, and reproductive function. Although the effects on the estrogen and androgen systems, as well as obesogenic potential, show variability across studies, several studies have indicated significant biological impacts. Of particular concern is the potential neurodevelopmental toxicity, which may manifest only after long-term exposure and is often irreversible. Even if current leaching levels from food contact materials are minimal, environmental accumulation and biomagnification over time may pose significant risks. Therefore, comprehensive toxicological profiling of TMBPF is essential. This review summarizes the current toxicological findings on TMBPF and discusses the implications for future research and regulatory considerations, highlighting the importance of early attention to potential public health impacts. Strengthening the toxicological evidence base will help inform regulatory frameworks and support proactive measures to safeguard consumer safety as the use of TMBPF expands.",

        "doi": "10.1038/s41398-025-03570-6",
        "abstract": "Maternal subclinical hypothyroidism (SCH) has been associated with neurodevelopmental disorders, but the molecular mechanisms underlying its impact on offspring behavior remain poorly understood. This study investigates the role of the Wnt/BDNF signaling pathway in the development of autism-like behaviors in male offspring rats born to SCH mothers. Our findings demonstrate that maternal SCH induces significant behavioral abnormalities in the offspring, including increased grooming behavior and deficits in social interaction, which are hallmarks of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). These behaviors correlate with alterations in hippocampal protein expression, particularly a decrease in Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) and key signaling molecules involved in neuronal survival, such as cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) and B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2). Additionally, we observe a marked upregulation of mTOR gene expression and a downregulation of Wnt signaling in the hippocampus of SCH-exposed offspring. These molecular changes are consistent with disrupted synaptic plasticity and neurogenesis, which are critical processes for cognitive and social development. Our study further reveals that impaired Wnt/BDNF signaling may play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of autism-like behaviors in these offspring. Moreover, sex-specific differences were observed in the behavioral manifestations, with male offspring showing more pronounced deficits, suggesting a gender-dependent sensitivity to maternal SCH. This research provides novel insights into the molecular pathways by which maternal thyroid dysfunction contributes to neurodevelopmental disorders, offering potential targets for therapeutic intervention.",

        "abstract": "Congenital hypothyroidism (CH) is the most common congenital endocrine disorder and one of the most preventable causes of intellectual disability. The underlying etiology of CH can be thyroid dysgenesis or dyshormonogenesis, and in rare cases, CH can occur as part of a genetic syndrome. Sotos syndrome is a rare overgrowth disorder caused by pathogenic variants in the NSD1 gene, characterized by excessive growth in infancy, distinctive facial features, and developmental delay.\nWe describe two unrelated children with permanent CH and genetically confirmed Sotos syndrome. Both children were referred to our Pediatric Endocrinology Centre due to abnormal thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) values detected through neonatal screening. A permanent CH was confirmed in both cases: one patient had thyroid hypoplasia with the presence of only the right thyroidal lobe; the other one had an in-situ thyroid gland. The diagnosis of Sotos syndrome was made later in infancy. In the first case, auxological parameters at birth were within normal ranges and overgrowth became apparent after six months of age; in the second case, overgrowth was already manifest at birth, but the diagnosis was guided primarily by the neurodevelopmental delay.\nWe describe two cases in which CH occurred with Sotos syndrome, and we hypothesize that this association may not be coincidental. To our knowledge, these are among the few reported cases of genetically confirmed Sotos syndrome associated with permanent congenital hypothyroidism. Further studies are needed to determine whether CH is a clinical feature of Sotos syndrome or an unrelated finding. We recommend early thyroid function testing in patients with Sotos syndrome and suggest suspecting Sotos syndrome in children presenting with CH, cognitive delay and overgrowth or additional congenital anomalies.",

        "abstract": "Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are both common neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs), but their association between maternal thyroid dysfunction and NDDs in offspring remains equivocal. This study aimed to evaluate the association between maternal thyroid dysfunction, related medications, and neurodevelopmental disorders in offspring. This population-based retrospective birth cohort study included children born between 2004 and 2020, with surveillance continuing through 2021. Maternal thyroid dysfunction during pregnancy was identified by any outpatient or inpatient diagnosis of hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism. Medications for hyperthyroidism during pregnancy, including propylthiouracil (PTU) and methimazole (MMI), as well as levothyroxine for hypothyroidism, were also examined. Associations between maternal thyroid dysfunction with medication use and child NDDs were modeled using Cox proportional hazards regression. The study cohort consisted of 3,175,328 live-born children. Among them, 39,294 (1.2%) were born to mothers with hyperthyroidism, and 14,630 (0.5%) had mothers with hypothyroidism. A higher risk of ADHD was noted in children whose mothers had thyroid dysfunction, whether they had hyperthyroidism (adjusted HR, 1.19; 95% CI,1.14-1.24) or hypothyroidism (adjusted HR,1.28; 95% CI,1.19-1.37), and a similarly increased risk of ASD was observed in association with maternal hyperthyroidism (adjusted HR, 1.14; 95% CI, 1.03-1.27) or hypothyroidism (adjusted HR, 1.34; 95% CI, 1.19-1.51). For medications in treating hyperthyroidism during pregnancy, continuous propylthiouracil (PTU) use was associated with a lower risk of ADHD (adjusted HR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.83-0.99) or ASD (adjusted HR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.67-0.96). This study identified the association between maternal thyroid dysfunction during pregnancy and offspring ADHD. Moreover, we observed that continuous use of PTU for treating maternal hyperthyroidism during pregnancy may be associated with a reduced risk of childhood ADHD.",

        "abstract": "Distinguishing between transient congenital hypothyroidism (TCH) and permanent congenital hypothyroidism (PCH) remains clinically challenging and is typically deferred until the age of 2-3\u2009years, to minimise the potential risk of adverse neurodevelopmental effects due to treatment cessation. However, evidence suggests that earlier discrimination may be feasible, thus avoiding unnecessary, potentially harmful, prolonged levothyroxine (LT4) treatment. This narrative review aims to provide an overview of the current literature regarding potential predictive markers for distinguishing PCH from TCH.\nA comprehensive search of the PubMed and Google Scholar databases was independently performed by two authors to identify studies that evaluated the utility of several predictive factors.\nA total of 27 studies were included. The most commonly proposed predictors were thyroid imaging findings, thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels at diagnosis, LT4 doses at various time points during the treatment period, absolute daily LT4 dose, and episodes of TSH elevation above the reference interval during treatment.\nDespite these advances, no single marker or combination of markers has yet proven definitive in reliably differentiating PCH from TCH. Further research is needed to establish predictive models that could facilitate the early identification of TCH and the timely and safe treatment withdrawal.",

        "abstract": "This case report describes an early adolescent girl who began experiencing recurrent paroxysmal events, behavioural changes and involuntary body movements from toddler age, shortly after a febrile illness. Prolonged seizures and developmental regression followed the febrile episode. Although she regained most of her milestones, she continued to have seizures over the years and developed stereotypic hand movements, emotional instability and hyperactivity. Despite extensive investigations, a definitive diagnosis remained elusive. She was initially diagnosed with intellectual disability, autism spectrum disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and seizure disorder. However, re-evaluation in early adolescence confirmed the presence of intrathecal N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antibodies and type 2 oligoclonal bands, thereby establishing the diagnosis. The patient was treated with a combination of immunotherapies, including methylprednisolone, rituximab and intravenous immunoglobulin, with partial clinical improvement observed over 4\u2009months of follow-up. This case highlights the importance of reconsidering the diagnosis in children presenting with unexplained neuropsychiatric symptoms and seizures.",

        "abstract": "Background Subclinical hypothyroidism (SCH) in pregnancy poses serious maternal and fetal risks, including miscarriage, gestational diabetes, and neurodevelopmental impairment. Despite clear international guidelines like those from the American Thyroid Association (ATA), global practice remains inconsistent. In Saudi Arabia, where SCH prevalence among pregnant women is notably high (13%), there is limited national data on how closely physicians follow these guidelines. This study aimed to evaluate current clinical practices, adherence to ATA recommendations, and influencing factors across medical specialties. Methods A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted from January to April 2025 using a nationwide online survey targeting licensed physicians involved in obstetric care. The structured questionnaire, adapted from a validated US-based tool, collected data on the SCH screening methods, diagnostic thresholds, use of anti-TPO antibodies, levothyroxine (LT4) prescribing patterns, and guideline familiarity. Adherence scores were computed based on alignment with key ATA recommendations. Statistical analyses, including Chi-square tests, t-tests, and analysis of variance (ANOVA), were performed to assess associations between adherence and physician-related variables. Results A total of 280 physicians participated, with most practicing in government hospitals (188, 67.1%)\u00a0and in the Central Region (220, 78.6%). Although all participants (280, 100.0%)\u00a0reported screening based on risk factors or symptoms, only 65 (23.2%) had reviewed the ATA guidelines, and 12 (4.3%) applied the recommended TSH cutoff of >2.5 mIU/L in the first trimester. Routine anti-TPO testing was reported by 99 (35.4%) participants, and only nine (3.2%) adhered to the four-week TSH monitoring interval. The mean adherence score was 6.17 (SD = 3.84), significantly associated with physician confidence (r = 0.310, p < .001) and experience (r = 0.323, p < .001). Endocrinologists and academic physicians demonstrated the highest adherence, while general practitioners and physicians from the Western Region showed the lowest. Clinical decision-making was primarily influenced by TSH levels (32, 11.4%), symptoms (18, 6.4%), and guideline awareness (14, 5.0%). Most respondents (208 (74.3%)\u00a0prescribed LT4 monotherapy, often initiating fixed low doses. Conclusion The study revealed substantial variability and low overall adherence to the ATA guidelines among physicians in Saudi Arabia managing SCH during pregnancy. Gaps were most evident in the TSH cutoff application, antibody testing, and postpartum management. These findings highlight the need for targeted education, national consensus protocols, and specialty-specific training to standardize care and improve maternal-fetal outcomes.",

        "abstract": "Previous studies often overlooked the roles of hypoxia and lactate metabolism in the breast cancer (BRCA) microenvironment. This study developed and validated a novel prognostic model for BRCA based on hypoxia-related genes (HRGs) and lactate metabolism-related genes (LMRGs) using machine learning approaches. The aim was to identify molecular subtypes capable of predicting patient prognosis and treatment response, thereby facilitating precision medicine strategies for BRCA.\nThis study utilized bulk RNA-sequencing data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) BRCA cohort (1,079 tumor samples; 99 normal samples) as the training set, with five independent validation cohorts (GSE19615, GSE20685, GSE20711, GSE42568, GSE58812) retrieved from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. HRGs and LMRGs were identified from the Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB). A machine learning-based integrative approach was employed to construct the Hypoxia and Lactate Metabolism Prognostic Score (HLMPS) via 10-fold cross-validation and multiple algorithm combinations. Model robustness was rigorously assessed through Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, time-dependent receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, and calibration plots with Brier score quantification.\nThe HLMPS model demonstrated robust prognostic discrimination, with high-risk patients exhibiting significantly inferior overall survival compared to low-risk counterparts [training set areas under the curve (AUCs): 0.76, 0.77, 0.74 at 1/3/5 years; validation sets AUCs: 0.61, 0.65, 0.67 at 1/3/5 years]. Functional enrichment analysis revealed that patients with a high HLMPS tended to have dysregulation of cell cycle and neurodevelopmental pathways, while those with a low HLMPS exhibited activation of immune pathways, including T-cell receptor (TCR) signaling and antigen presentation. An Immune infiltration analysis showed that patients with a low HLMPS had higher levels of immune cell infiltration and better responsiveness to immunotherapy. Meanwhile, patients with a low HLMPS showed greater sensitivity to drugs such as irinotecan and palbociclib, while patients with a high HLMPS were more sensitive to drugs such as lapatinib and sorafenib.\nThe HLMPS model represents a novel and clinically actionable tool for prognosticating outcomes and therapeutic responses in BRCA patients. This study highlights the potential of precision medicine strategies that integrate HRGs and LMRGs based on tumor microenvironment (TME) features. Future work should focus on validating the HLMPS model in larger, multicenter cohorts and determining its clinical applicability in guiding personalized treatment decisions for patients with BRCA.",

        "abstract": "Exposure to bisphenols and perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) is linked to various health impairments, including (developmental) neurotoxicity. Evidence indicates that bisphenols and PFAS can impact early neurodevelopmental processes such as proliferation, migration, and differentiation, although little is known about the effects of these compounds on neuronal activity and network development. Therefore, we assessed the effects of acute and chronic exposure to different bisphenols (bisphenol-A (BPA), bisphenol-F (BPF), and bisphenol-S (BPS)) and PFAS (perfluorooctanoate (PFOA), perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS), and perfluorohexanesulfonate (PFHxS)) on neuronal activity and network development in rat primary cortical cultures using micro-electrode array recordings. Acute exposure to BPA and BPF decreased neuronal activity, while BPS had no effect. Chronic exposure to 100\u00a0\u03bcM BPA decreased network development, while chronic exposure to 10\u00a0\u03bcM BPA, 100\u00a0\u03bcM BPF, and 100\u00a0\u03bcM BPS induced a hyperexcitation. Thus, differences in the molecular structure of bisphenols and exposure duration influence the effects of these compounds on neuronal activity and network development. In contrast, both acute and chronic exposure to PFOS, PFOA, and PFHxS had limited effects on neuronal activity and network development. Since bisphenols and PFAS are known endocrine-disrupting compounds, we also evaluated the possible involvement of estrogen, glucocorticoid, thyroid hormone, and aryl hydrocarbon receptor pathways in the observed neurotoxic effects. Our cortical cultures appeared insensitive to endocrine-mediated effects of (ant)agonists of these pathways, making it unlikely that the observed neurotoxic effects are endocrine-mediated. These findings contribute to hazard assessment for toxicological risk assessments and emphasize the need to consider molecular structure in evaluating neurotoxicity.",

        "abstract": "Congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDG) are a heterogeneous group of inborn errors of metabolism caused by impaired protein glycosylation. Among these, PMM2-CDG, caused by defective phosphomannomutase 2 activity and affecting protein N-glycosylation, is the most prevalent. As glycoproteins are involved in almost every physiological process, the clinical manifestations in PMM2-CDG are diverse and multisystemic. In the endocrine system, glycoproteins are present in every axis, acting as hormones, prohormones, receptors, enzymes, and transport proteins. Hypoglycosylation can alter hormonal function on multiple levels. As a result, endocrinopathies are frequently part of the clinical spectrum of PMM2-CDG, particularly hypergonadotrophic hypogonadism and pubertal abnormalities in female patients. Symptoms of endocrine involvement, especially hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia and failure to thrive during infancy, can be the presenting sign of the disease. The clinical spectrum of PMM2-CDG endocrinopathy is variable; for example, thyroid involvement can range from isolated transitory hyperthyrotropinemia to clinical hypothyroidism. Some endocrine abnormalities, such as adrenal insufficiency, are uncommon and probably underdiagnosed in PMM2-CDG. The new insights into the role of N-glycosylation on the endocrine system over the past twenty years have deepened our understanding of this complex disorder and should enable us to improve and personalize the clinical management of these patients.",

        "abstract": "Congenital hypothyroidism (CH) requires early diagnosis to prevent irreversible neurodevelopmental impairments. This study aimed to determine cutoff values for initial capillary thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), first venous TSH, and levothyroxine (LT4) dose at 6\u00a0months to differentiate between transient and permanent\u00a0CH.\nA retrospective analysis was conducted on 289 patients diagnosed with CH at the Pediatric Endocrinology Clinic of the University of Health Sciences, Umraniye Training and Research Hospital, from January 2014 to September 2021. Patients received treatment and were followed for at least 6\u00a0months after treatment discontinuation or remained under therapy. Patients were divided into two groups: permanent CH and transient CH. Initial capillary TSH, first venous TSH, and LT4 dose at 6\u00a0months were recorded, and cutoff values were determined using ROC analysis.\nOf the 289 patients, 179 (62\u202f%) had transient CH and 110 (38\u202f%) had permanent CH. The permanent CH group had significantly higher levels of capillary TSH, first venous TSH, and LT4 dose at 6\u00a0months (p<0.001). The cutoff values for predicting transient CH were <23.1 mIU/L for capillary TSH, <64.5 mIU/L for first venous TSH, and <3.6 \u00b5g/kg/day for LT4 dose at 6\u00a0months, all statistically significant.\nInitial capillary TSH, first venous TSH, and LT4 dose at 6\u00a0months are reliable predictors for distinguishing between transient and permanent CH. These cutoff values provide clinical guidance, especially for early treatment discontinuation in patients with LT4 doses below 3.6 \u00b5g/kg/day, indicating a higher likelihood of transient\u00a0CH.",

        "doi": "10.3390/nu17142362",
        "abstract": "The thyroid gland plays a crucial role in regulating metabolism and supporting development through the production of the hormones T4 and T3. These hormones are essential during childhood for nervous system myelination, physical growth, puberty, skeletal and dental maturation, and overall metabolic balance. In early infancy, when the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis is still immature, thyroid dysfunction can result in a range of long-term complications. The metabolism and action of thyroid hormones depend not only on iodine but also on other vital micronutrients, particularly selenium (Se). This narrative review aims to comprehensively examine the role of selenium in maintaining thyroid health from fetal life through adolescence. Selenium is a key micronutrient involved in thyroid development, hormone synthesis, antioxidant defense, and immune regulation, especially during pregnancy and childhood. Inadequate selenium levels may contribute to the onset, progression, and clinical management of various thyroid disorders, particularly hypothyroidism and autoimmune thyroid diseases. Although scientific evidence supports selenium's critical functions in hormone metabolism and antioxidant protection, public awareness and monitoring of selenium intake remain insufficient. Beyond the need for further research, there is an urgent call for integrated public health strategies, ranging from sustainable, food-based approaches to targeted clinical screening and educational programs. Promoting awareness of selenium's importance and incorporating selenium status into maternal and pediatric care protocols could play a significant role in preventing deficiencies and supporting long-term endocrine and neurodevelopmental health.",

        "doi": "10.2903/j.efsa.2025.9478",
        "abstract": "This updated risk assessment evaluated evidence on potential adverse health effects of fluoride related to all sources of oral exposure as mandated by the European Commission. Fluoride benefit assessment was not included. Effects on the central nervous system, thyroid and bone were prioritised. Evidence from human studies indicates that total fluoride intake is associated with adverse effects on the developing brain at drinking water concentrations >\u20091.5 mg/L. The evidence of such associations below 1.5 mg/L was not sufficiently consistent to draw conclusions for risk assessment. Using drinking water concentration of 1.5 mg/L as a reference point, a safe level of intake including all sources of oral exposure of 3.3 mg/day was established for pregnant women to protect the fetus. This safe level of intake was extended to apply to other adults and children >\u20098\u2009years. It is considered protective also against possible adverse effects on thyroid function and bone mineralisation, for which associations have been observed at water concentrations >\u20091.5 mg/L. Dental fluorosis was considered the most sensitive endpoint for children \u2264\u20098\u2009years. Tolerable upper intake levels (UL) of 1.0, 1.6 and 2.0 mg/day were established for infants, toddlers and children 4-8\u2009years, respectively. These ULs are considered protective against other possible adverse effects of fluoride, including neurodevelopmental outcomes. Aggregate exposure included intake of fluoride from food, drinking water, discretionary salt and (ingested) dental care products. Aggregate exposure based on the mean concentration of fluoride in EU drinking water (submitted data) was below the above health-based guidance values (HBGVs) for all age groups. Aggregate exposure exceeds the HBGVs at the 95th percentile of intake in the scenario of the P95 concentration of fluoride in EU drinking water, for all age groups except adolescents. The risk assessment suggests that the current legal limit for drinking water (1.5 mg/L) in the EU is not sufficiently protective.",

MCT8 and OATP1C1, two solute carrier (SLC) transporters, mediate the passage of thyroid hormones across the blood-brain barrier and into the central nervous system. Mutations in MCT8 result in Allan-Herndon-Dudley syndrome (AHDS), an X-linked birth defect characterized by neurodevelopmental impairments and peripheral hyperthyroidism, whereas OATP1C1 deficiency is linked to brain hypometabolism and progressive neurodegeneration. Here, we report cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of MCT8 and OATP1C1 bound with the active thyroid hormone triiodothyronine (T3) and the prohormone thyroxine (T4) at 2.9 and 2.3 \u00c5 resolutions, respectively. Combined with functional studies, we elucidate their distinct thyroid hormone recognition and transport mechanisms and explain disease mutations. Although extracellular allosteric sites are not a common feature of SLC transporters, we identify one in OATP1C1. Collectively, these findings illuminate key aspects of thyroid hormone transport, a fundamental process in development and disease.",

Hence, this review article provides background information for all stakeholders, from scientists to clinicians and policymakers. A disproportionate increase in research activity was observed, mainly from the USA and China, with a strong north-south divide. Multi-disciplinarity is characteristic, with a trend toward an ecological focus. Low- and middle-income economies are underrepresented in research on EDs. Therefore, global research needs to be refocused and expanded to more global approaches that take inspiration from the few successful collaborations with their synergistic effects.",

        "abstract": "Manganese (Mn) is an essential trace element that, in excess, may initiate adverse health effects. Recent evidence suggested that environmental exposure to Mn may produce thyroid hormone imbalances leading to adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes. The aim of this review was to summarize available evidence regarding Mn exposure and consequent adverse thyroid effects, including potential implications for neurodevelopmental impairment in children. Medline, EMBASE, and Scopus were systematically searched using two concepts: Mn exposure and thyroid function. A total of 31 studies (17\u00a0human studies, 14 toxicological studies) fulfilled eligibility criteria. Evidence for effects attributed to Mn on the thyroid from human studies is inconclusive. No apparent studies were identified to directly characterize Mn thyroid-mediated effects on neurodevelopmental outcomes. Although limited evidence from animal studies provides some support for the effects of Mn on thyroid-related hormones, it is unclear whether such hormonal imbalance is a result of a direct or indirect biological mechanism of action. Toxicokinetic data demonstrated that Mn accumulates in thyroid tissue and might interfere with thyroid function. Currently, there are limited data on biological mechanisms of action for the effects of Mn on the thyroid. Although evidence to date is suggestive of Mn thyroid-related activity, the lack of adequate studies precludes a causal interpretation.",

        "abstract": "Iodine deficiency remains one of the most serious global public health challenges, recognised as the leading cause of preventable brain damage worldwide. It is widely accepted as the primary aetiological factor underlying iodine deficiency disorders (IDD). Inadequate maternal iodine intake reduces thyroxine synthesis, impairing foetal brain development and leading to long-term deficits in cognitive function across childhood and adulthood. However, emerging evidence also suggests that excessive iodine intake may disrupt thyroid function, particularly in individuals with underlying thyroid autoimmunity, potentially leading to adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes. In this state-of-the-art review, we examine the effects of iodine nutrition during pregnancy and lactation on child cognitive outcomes. We provide an overview of the recent global iodine status, critically appraise the current evidence linking both iodine deficiency and excess to neurodevelopmental outcomes, and offer expert interpretation of the key findings. We further highlight areas of uncertainty, introduce emerging evidence from contemporary studies, and propose directions for future research to inform and optimise public health policies and clinical practice. Our findings highlight a U-shaped association, whereby both insufficient and excessive iodine exposure during pregnancy and lactation may impair optimal brain development in the offspring.",

Controls received vehicle. Offspring were assessed neonatally (postnatal day 9) for communication (ultrasonic vocalizations), neurogenesis (NeuN+ neurons), myelination (MBP+ area), and brain docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). Adolescent offspring (6-8 weeks) underwent behavioral tests for cognition (Y-maze, novel object recognition) and sociability (three-chamber test).\nT-exposed pups had lower birth weights and reduced vocalizations during maternal separation. Sex-specific neural changes observed: males showed reduced cortical neuron density, while females had diminished corpus callosum myelination. Both sexes exhibited decreased brain DHA. In adolescence, T offspring displayed cognitive deficits (impaired spatial/recognition memory) and social impairments (reduced sociability and social novelty preference).\nThe study highlights maternal T as a risk factor for neurodevelopmental disorders, with sex-specific effects on brain structure and function. Reduced brain DHA suggests a mechanistic link, implicating lipid metabolism in T-associated neurodevelopmental disruptions. These findings support further exploration of DHA supplementation as a therapeutic strategy to mitigate adverse outcomes in high-risk pregnancies.\nElevated maternal testosterone (T) during pregnancy induces ASD-like neurobehavioral deficits (e.g., impaired communication, social/cognitive dysfunction) and sex-specific neural alterations in offspring.

        "abstract": "Testosterone deficiency (TD) is a clinically significant condition strongly associated with aging and metabolic syndrome. While previous studies have established links between muscle mass and TD, evidence regarding the relationship between muscle quality index (MQI) and TD remains limited. This study aimed to investigate the association between MQI and TD in adult males in the United States and to develop an interpretable machine learning (ML) model based on SHapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP) for predicting TD risk.\nWe conducted a cross-sectional study using weighted multivariate logistic regression and subgroup analysis to assess the association between MQI and TD. Six ML models incorporating MQI were developed to predict TD risk. Model performance was evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), confusion matrix, F1 score, Brier score, and precision-recall curve. The optimal model was selected based on these metrics and further interpreted using SHAP to elucidate feature importance and decision-making processes.\nThe study included 2,628 eligible male participants, with a TD prevalence of 25.76%. After adjusting for confounders, each unit increase in MQI was associated with a 52% reduction in TD risk (OR\u2009=\u20090.480, 95% CI: 0.362-0.636, P\u2009<\u20090.001), demonstrating a dose-response relationship. Among the six ML models, the Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LGBM) exhibited the best predictive performance, achieving an AUC of 0.746 (95% CI: 0.707-0.790). SHAP analysis revealed that body mass index (BMI) was the most influential feature in the LGBM model, followed by high-density lipoprotein and MQI. Notably, lower MQI values were consistently associated with a higher risk of TD.\nOur findings indicate that MQI is an independent and reliable predictor of TD in males. The interpretable LGBM model provides a cost-effective and clinically applicable tool for early TD risk assessment. These results underscore the importance of muscle quality in testosterone regulation and may inform preventive strategies to mitigate TD risk in adult males.",

Here, we investigate the effects of excess testosterone (T) during a critical period of sex-specific brain organization on social approach and fear learning behaviors in C57BL/6J wild-type mice. Male, but not female, mice treated with T on the day of birth (Postnatal Day 0; PN0) exhibited decreased social approach as juveniles and decreased contextual fear memory as adults, compared with vehicle (veh)-treated controls. These deficits were not driven by anxiety-like behavior or changes in locomotion or body weight. Mice treated with the same dose of T on PN18, which is outside of the critical period of brain masculinization, did not demonstrate impairments compared with the veh group.

        "abstract": "This article explores the intricate relationship between androgens, androgen receptors, and the central nervous system. We examine the role of physiologically derived androgens and androgenic supplements in neurodevelopment and neuroplasticity and delve into the involvement of androgen pathways in the pathogenesis of various neurological disorders.\nThis review highlights the increasing recognition of testosterone and androgen signaling in various neurological conditions, with evidence of both protective and harmful effects depending on dosage and context. Although limited to experimental use, testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) may serve potential benefits in the management of multiple sclerosis, epilepsy, headache, Duchenne muscular dystrophy, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and Parkinson disease. On the other hand, androgen-blocking treatments may help alter disease progression in spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy. Testosterone supplementation can have potential adverse events when used at a supratherapeutic level, and prenatal testosterone exposure is believed to contribute to the pathogenesis of neurodevelopmental disease. Additionally, androgen-blocking agents could increase the risk of neurodegenerative conditions, such as Parkinson disease and Alzheimer disease. Despite the above findings, there is no established indication of TRT or androgen-blocking medication in neurological disorders. The body of evidence highlighting the involvement of androgens and androgen receptors (ARs) in pathogenesis of neurological diseases is growing. This includes ongoing research exploring the potential therapeutic targets involving the androgen signaling pathway for management of neurological disorders. Future placebo-controlled clinical trials are essential to determine the efficacy and safety of TRT or androgen-blocking therapies in managing neurological disease.",

This study investigated the effects of chronic exposure to E2\u03b2 and MT on brain development and neuroendocrine regulation in Leiocassis longirostris, a commercially important catfish species endemic to the Yangtze River Basin. Juvenile fish were exposed to three nominal dietary doses (100-300\u202fng) of each hormone for 30 days, corresponding to waterborne concentrations (556-1667\u202fng/L) within the upper range of environmental detections. Histopathological analysis revealed dose-dependent plasma accumulation in cerebral microvasculature, indicative of compromised blood-brain barrier integrity. Transcriptomic profiling identified significant suppression of immediate early genes (IEGs) critical for synaptic plasticity, including FOS, JUN, EGR1, NR4A1, CEBP-A/D, and ETS1, with E2\u03b2 exerting stronger inhibitory effects (maximal at 200 ng-dose). Concomitant upregulation of neuroendocrine genes cga (gonadotropin \u03b1-subunit) and pomcb (pro-opiomelanocortin) suggested compensatory endocrine feedback mechanisms. Growth inhibition was observed in both treatment groups, with E2\u03b2-induced reductions in body weight exceeding those of MT. Functional enrichment analysis linked these transcriptional changes to disrupted pathways in synaptic signaling, chromatin remodeling, and endocrine regulation. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that estrogenic and androgenic EDCs impair neurodevelopmental processes via suppression of IEGs, leading to growth retardation and endocrine dysregulation. This study underscores the sublethal risks posed by sex steroid EDCs to wild fish populations and highlights the need for targeted regulatory measures to mitigate aquatic endocrine disruption.",

        "abstract": "Klinefelter syndrome (KS) is a genetic condition characterised by the presence of an extra X chromosome in males (47,XXY). KS is associated with various phenotypic characteristics in adult life, including infertility, hypogonadism and increased risk of type II diabetes, cardiovascular disease and osteoporosis. Additionally, individuals with KS often experience mental health challenges and functional impairments that significantly impact their quality of life. Currently, testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) in adolescence is considered the first-line treatment by some physicians for patients with KS and biochemical signs of hypogonadism. However, comprehensive evidence on its effectiveness in preventing typical phenotypic traits associated with KS remains limited, and, currently, no evidence-based recommendations for TRT in this population exist. We therefore aim to evaluate the effects of two years of TRT during puberty in boys with KS. The primary endpoint is to monitor changes in body fat percentage. Secondary endpoints include changes in pubertal development and virilisation, growth and body proportions, bone mineralisation, muscle strength, lipid and glucose metabolism, systemic inflammation, methylation, fertility and effects on the cognitive and psychopathological features of KS.\nThe TIPY study is a multicentre, national, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled intervention study. Participants will be recruited from four tertiary paediatric endocrine units in Denmark that manage boys with KS. Participants will be randomised to treatment with transdermal placebo or transdermal testosterone (Androgel; Besins Healthcare, Paris, France) with dose titration every 3\u2009months based on individual measurements of serum concentrations of testosterone. Dose titration will be conducted by a single physician to ensure free testosterone remains between +1\u2009and +3\u2009SD for age.Thorough clinical and biochemical evaluation will be performed at baseline, after 12 months and 24 months. Additional visits for minor evaluations will occur every 3 months. Neuropsychological assessment will be conducted at baseline and after 24 months of treatment.\nThe study will be conducted in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration. The study has been approved by the Danish National Medical Research Ethics Committee and the Danish Medicines Agency (Clinical trials information system number 2023-505854-16-00). Results will be submitted for publication in peer-reviewed journals.\nNCT06294990.",

        "abstract": "Maternal hormonal and metabolic disorders, such as diabetes and obesity, can adversely affect the intrauterine environment, resulting in suboptimal fetal growth and an elevated risk of cardiovascular and metabolic diseases in the later life of the offspring. In this review, we examine the long-term impact of elevated maternal androgen levels during pregnancy on offspring. Maternal hyperandrogenemia is linked to various neurodevelopmental disorders, including attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, autism spectrum disorder, and anxiety-like behaviors, mediated by alterations in key brain regions responsible for emotion and cognition. Furthermore, children born to mothers with hyperandrogenemia exhibit heightened risk of metabolic and cardiovascular dysfunctions, such as obesity, insulin resistance, and hypertension, which can manifest early in life. Prenatal exposure to androgens has also been linked to reduced birth weights and altered fetal growth, potentially due to impaired placental function. Additionally, maternal testosterone levels influence offspring sex ratios, often favoring male births, though exceptions occur in certain conditions, such as congenital adrenal hyperplasia. The findings of this review underscore the need for healthcare professionals to monitor maternal serum androgen profiles during pregnancy. Further research is needed to determine underlying mechanisms and potential interventions to mitigate these risks.",

        "abstract": "Klinefelter syndrome (KS) is caused by the presence of a supernumerary X chromosome (conferring the classical 47,XXY karyotype) and is the most common sex chromosome abnormality in men. The clinical features described in the early characterization of the syndrome include tall stature, small testes, hypogonadism, gynecomastia, and neurodevelopmental deficits. However, the syndrome presents a broad phenotypic spectrum that seems to be evolving, along with environmental and general health changes. Although a proportion of men with KS are asymptomatic, others experience numerous severe comorbidities, ranging from cardiovascular to autoimmune disorders. Once considered a hallmark of the syndrome, the inability to conceive can now be overcome with assisted reproductive technology. The neuropsychological stigmata, once overstated, thereafter inadvertently dismissed, now demand a more balanced and objective approach. Significant advances have been made in our understanding of KS over recent years, including the molecular machinery involved in the chromosomal disjunction that gives rise to the syndrome. Our understanding of the risk-benefit of testosterone replacement therapy has greatly improved; however, many gaps persist. Future work should be prioritized according to the needs of people with KS. There are opportunities for new research addressing the fields of fertility, cardiovascular prevention, neurodevelopment, quality of life, and bone health. Above all, solid registries and extensive prospective longitudinal studies are needed to enroll people with KS to determine their evolving needs as they progress through their lifespan. These studies would be best initiated with international collaboration to ensure the results apply to all those with this condition worldwide.",

The aim of this study is to investigate the role of InhB, AMH levels, and 2D/4D finger length ratios in male children with specific learning disorder (SLD).\nThe study included 38 male children diagnosed with SLD and 38 males of similar ages without SLD as the control group.

Serum AMH, InhB, and Testosterone levels were measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.\nMale children diagnosed with SLD demonstrated significantly higher levels of serum InhB compared to controls (t= 2.59 p=0.009); both groups had similar levels of serum testosterone and AMH. The 2D/4D finger ratios in the SLD group were found to be lower than those in the control group (t= 2.92 p= 0.005). Serum InhB levels were positively correlated with WISC-R verbal scores (p= 0.003).\nOur findings suggest that serum InhB levels and the 2D/4D ratio, which is an indicator of prenatal testosterone exposure, may play a role in the male predominance of SLD.",

        "doi": "10.1016/j.bpsgos.2024.100343",
        "abstract": "Sex differences are widespread during neurodevelopment and play a role in neuropsychiatric conditions such as autism, which is more prevalent in males than females. In humans, males have been shown to have larger brain volumes than females with development of the hippocampus and amygdala showing prominent sex differences. Mechanistically, sex steroids and sex chromosomes drive these differences in brain development, which seem to peak during prenatal and pubertal stages. Animal models have played a crucial role in understanding sex differences, but the study of human sex differences requires an experimental model that can recapitulate complex genetic traits. To fill this gap, human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived brain organoids are now being used to study how complex genetic traits influence prenatal brain development. For example, brain organoids from individuals with autism and individuals with X chromosome-linked Rett syndrome and fragile X syndrome have revealed prenatal differences in cell proliferation, a measure of brain volume differences, and excitatory-inhibitory imbalances. Brain organoids have also revealed increased neurogenesis of excitatory neurons due to androgens. However, despite growing interest in using brain organoids, several key challenges remain that affect its validity as a model system. In this review, we discuss how sex steroids and the sex chromosomes each contribute to sex differences in brain development. Then, we examine the role of X chromosome inactivation as a factor that drives sex differences. Finally, we discuss the combined challenges of modeling X chromosome inactivation and limitations of brain organoids that need to be taken into consideration when studying sex differences.\nSex differences are a contributing factor in neuropsychiatric conditions such as autism, which is more prevalent in males. Sex differences occur through interactions between sex steroid hormones such as estrogen and testosterone and sex chromosomes (chrX and chrY). Human stem cell\u2013derived brain organoids are laboratory models that mimic brain development. For example, in individuals with neurodevelopmental conditions, brain organoids have revealed an imbalance of neuron populations compared with neurotypical individuals. In this review, we discuss sex steroid and sex chromosome influences on brain development and challenges of this model that need to be taken into account when studying sex differences.",

The digit ratio (2D:4D) is regarded as an indicator of prenatal testosterone exposure. This study aims to investigate the 2D:4D ratios and intelligence levels in individuals with specific learning disorders (SLD) and compare the ratios with healthy subjects.\nThe study included a total of 117 patients diagnosed with SLD and 67 healthy controls. We measured the 2D:4D ratios and administered the Wechsler-Intelligence Scale for Children-Revised to assess intelligence quotient (IQ) scores in the SLD group. Sociodemographic data was obtained for both patients and healthy subjects and compared in both groups, as well as 2D:4D ratios.\nCompared to healthy controls, both-hand 2D:4D ratios were found to be lower in the SLD group. In addition, male and female participants with SLD showed lower 2D:4D ratios in both hands than controls. The total scores on the WISC-R were found to decrease as the right-hand 2D:4D ratios and the age increased in the SLD group.\nOur findings add to the literature examining the influence of prenatal testosterone exposure on learning and intelligence in the SLD sample. Further research in this domain may yield valuable insights into the underlying mechanisms and potential clinical implications for the management of SLDs examining additional variables that could potentially impact alongside the impact of sex hormones on brain development.",

        "abstract": "An early prediction of outcomes of neonatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (NE) is of key importance in reducing neonatal mortality and morbidity. The objectives were (i) to analyze the characteristics of miRNA expression and metabolic patterns of neonates with NE and (ii) to assess their predictive performance for neurodevelopmental outcomes. Plasma samples from moderate/severe NE patients (N\u2009=\u200992) of the HYPOTOP study were collected before, during, and after therapeutic hypothermia (TH) and compared to a control group (healthy term infants). The expression of miRNAs and concentrations of metabolites (hypoxia-related and energy, steroid, and tryptophan metabolisms) were analyzed. Neurodevelopmental outcomes were evaluated at 24\u00a0months postnatal age using Bayley Scales of Infant Development, ed. III, BSID-III. Differences in miRNA and metabolic profiles were found between NE vs. control infants, abnormal (i.e., mildly and moderately abnormal and severe) vs. normal, and severe vs. non-severe (i.e., normal and mildly and moderately abnormal) BSID-III. 4-Androstene-3,17-dione, testosterone, betaine, xanthine, and lactate were suitable for BSID-III outcome prediction (receiver operating characteristic areas under the curve (AUCs)\u2009\u2265\u20090.6), as well as 68 miRNAs (AUCs of 0.5-0.9). Significant partial correlations of xanthine and betaine levels and the expression of several miRNAs with BSID-III sub-scales were found.\u00a0Conclusion: We have identified metabolites/miRNAs that might be useful to support the prediction of middle-term neurodevelopmental outcomes of NE.

        "abstract": "Rodent models of maternal immune activation (MIA) are increasingly used as experimental tools in preclinical research of immune-mediated neurodevelopmental disorders and mental illnesses. Using a viral-like MIA model that is based on prenatal poly(I:C) exposure in mice, we have recently identified the existence of subgroups of MIA-exposed offspring that show dissociable behavioral, transcriptional, brain network and inflammatory profiles even under conditions of genetic homogeneity and identical MIA. Here, we tested the hypothesis that the intrauterine positions of fetuses, which are known to shape individual variability in litter-bearing mammals through variations in fetal hormone exposure, may contribute to the variable outcomes of MIA in mice. MIA was induced by maternal administration of poly(I:C) on gestation day 12 in C57BL/6N mice. Determining intrauterine positions using delivery by Cesarean section (C-section), we found that MIA-exposed offspring developing between female fetuses only (0M-MIA offspring) displayed significant deficits in sociability and sensorimotor gating at adult age, whereas MIA-exposed offspring developing between one or two males in utero (1/2M-MIA offspring) did not show the same deficits. These intrauterine position effects similarly emerged in male and female offspring. Furthermore, while MIA elevated fetal brain levels of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines independently of the precise intrauterine position and sex of adjacent fetuses during the acute phase, fetal brain levels of TNF-\u03b1 remained elevated in 0M-MIA but not 1/2M-MIA offspring until the post-acute phase in late gestation. As expected, 1/2M offspring generally showed higher testosterone levels in the fetal brain during late gestation as compared to 0M offspring, confirming the transfer of testosterone from male fetuses to adjacent male or female fetuses. Taken together, our findings identify a novel source of within-litter variability contributing to heterogeneous outcomes of short- and long-term effects in a mouse model of MIA. In broader context, our findings highlight that individual differences in fetal exposure to hormonal and inflammatory signals may be a perinatal factor that shapes risk and resilience to MIA.",

However, more recent research has uncovered that oxytocin has a much wider range of roles in physiology and behavior. Despite the excitement surrounding potential therapeutical applications of intranasally administered oxytocin, the results of these intervention studies have been inconsistent. Various reasons for these mixed results have been proposed, which tend to focus on methodological issues, such as study design. While methodological issues are certainly important, emerging evidence suggests that the interaction between oxytocin and sex hormones may also account for these varied findings. To better understand the purpose and function of the interaction of oxytocin with sex hormones, with a focus on estrogens, progesterone, and testosterone, we conducted a comprehensive thematic review via four perspectives: evolutionary, developmental, mechanistic, and survival. Altogether, this synergistic approach highlights the critical function of sex hormone activity for accomplishing the diverse roles of oxytocin via the modulation of oxytocin release and oxytocin receptor activity, which is also likely to contribute to the heterogeneity of outcomes after oxytocin administration.",

        "abstract": "Neurodevelopmental disorders, which emerge early in development, include a range of neurological phenotypes and exhibit marked differences in prevalence between sexes. A male predominance is particularly pronounced in autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Although the precise cause of ASD is still unknown, certain genetic variations and environmental influences have been implicated as risk factors. Preclinical ASD models have been instrumental in shedding light on the mechanisms behind the sexual dimorphism observed in this disorder. In this review, we explore the potential processes contributing to sex bias by examining both intrinsic differences in neuronal mechanisms and the influence of external factors. We organize these mechanisms into six categories: 1) sexually dimorphic phenotypes in mice with mutations in ASD-associated genes related to synaptic dysfunction; 2) sex-specific microglial activity, which may disrupt neural circuit development by excessively pruning synapses during critical periods; 3) sex steroid hormones, such as testosterone and allopregnanolone, that differentially influence brain structure and function; 4) escape from X chromosome inactivation of the O-linked-N-acetylglucosamine transferase gene in the placenta; 5) sexually dimorphic activation of the integrated stress response pathway following maternal immune activation; and 6) immunological responses that are differentially regulated by sex. Understanding these mechanisms is essential for deciphering the underlying causes of ASD and may offer insights into other disorders with notable sex disparities.",

        "abstract": "Despite copious data linking brain function with changes to social behavior and mental health, little is known about how puberty relates to brain functioning. We investigated the specificity of brain network connectivity associations with pubertal indices and age to inform neurodevelopmental models of adolescence. We examined how brain network connectivity during a peer evaluation fMRI task related to pubertal hormones (dehydroepiandrosterone and testosterone), pubertal timing and status, and age. Participants were 99 adolescents assigned female at birth aged 9-15 (M = 12.38, SD = 1.81) enriched for the presence of internalizing symptoms. Multivariate analysis revealed that within Salience, between Frontoparietal - Reward and Cinguloopercular - Reward network connectivity were associated with all measures of pubertal development and age. Specifically, Salience connectivity linked with age, pubertal hormones, and status, but not timing. In contrast, Frontoparietal - Reward connectivity was only associated with hormones. Finally, Cinguloopercular - Reward connectivity related to age and pubertal status, but not hormones or timing. These results provide evidence that the salience processing underlying peer evaluation is jointly influenced by various indices of puberty and age, while coordination between cognitive control and reward circuitry is related to pubertal hormones, pubertal status, and age in unique ways.",

        "abstract": "Proper cerebrovascular development and neurogliovascular unit assembly are essential for brain growth and function throughout life, ensuring the continuous supply of nutrients and oxygen. This involves crucial events during pre- and postnatal stages through key pathways, including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and Wnt signaling. These pathways are pivotal for brain vascular growth, expansion, and blood-brain barrier (BBB) maturation. Interestingly, during fetal and neonatal life, cerebrovascular formation coincides with the early peak activity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, supporting the idea of sex hormonal influence on cerebrovascular development and barriergenesis.Sex hormonal dysregulation in early development has been implicated in neurodevelopmental disorders with highly sexually dimorphic features, such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Both disorders show higher prevalence in men, with varying symptoms between sexes, with boys exhibiting more externalizing behaviors, such as aggressivity or hyperactivity, and girls displaying higher internalizing behaviors, including anxiety, depression, or attention disorders. Indeed, ASD and ADHD are linked to high prenatal testosterone exposure and reduced aromatase expression, potentially explaining sex differences in prevalence and symptomatology. In line with this, high estrogen levels seem to attenuate ADHD symptoms. At the cerebrovascular level, sex- and region-specific variations of cerebral blood flow perfusion have been reported in both conditions, indicating an impact of gonadal hormones on the brain vascular system, disrupting its ability to respond to neuronal demands.This review aims to provide an overview of the existing knowledge concerning the impact of sex hormones on cerebrovascular formation and maturation, as well as the onset of neurodevelopmental disorders. Here, we explore the concept of gonadal hormone interactions with brain vascular and BBB development to function, with a particular focus on the modulation of VEGF and Wnt signaling. We outline how these pathways may be involved in the underpinnings of ASD and ADHD. Outstanding questions and potential avenues for future research are highlighted, as uncovering sex-specific physiological and pathological aspects of brain vascular development might lead to innovative therapeutic approaches in the context of ASD, ADHD and beyond.",

        "abstract": "Phthalates (PEs) are widely used plasticizers in polymer products, and humans are increasingly exposed to them. This study was designed to investigate the alleviative effect of phytochemicals quercetin (Que) against male reproductive toxicity caused by the mixture of three commonly used PEs (MPEs), and further to explore the underlying mechanism. Forty-eight male SD rats were randomly and evenly divided into control group, Que group, MPEs group and MPEs+Que group (n\u00a0=\u00a012); The oral exposure doses of MPEs and Que were 450\u00a0mg/kg/d and 50\u00a0mg/kg/d, respectively. After 91 days of continuous intervention, compared with control group, the testes weight, epididymis weight, serum sex hormones, and anogenital distance were significantly decreased in MPEs group (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05); Testicular histopathological observation showed that all seminiferous tubules were atrophy, leydig cells were hyperplasia, spermatogenic cells growth were arrested in MPEs group. Ultrastructural observation of testicular germ cells showed that the edges of the nuclear membranes were indistinct, and the mitochondria were severely damaged with the cristae disrupted, decreased or even disappeared in MPEs group. Immunohistochemistry and Western blot analysis showed that testicular CYP11A1, CYP17A1 and 17\u03b2-HSD were up-regulated, while StAR, PIWIL1 and PIWIL2 were down-regulated in MPEs group (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05); However, the alterations of these parameters were restored in MPEs+Que group. The results indicated MPEs disturbed steroid hormone metabolism, and caused male reproductive injuries; whereas, Que could inhibit MPEs' male reproductive toxicity, which might relate to the restored regulation of steroid hormone metabolism.",

        "abstract": "We have recently demonstrated a causal link between loss of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), the master molecule regulating reproduction, and cognitive deficits during pathological aging, including Down syndrome and Alzheimer's disease. Olfactory and cognitive alterations, which persist in some COVID-19 patients, and long-term hypotestosteronaemia in SARS-CoV-2-infected men are also reminiscent of the consequences of deficient GnRH, suggesting that GnRH system neuroinvasion could underlie certain post-COVID symptoms and thus lead to accelerated or exacerbated cognitive decline.\nWe explored the hormonal profile of COVID-19 patients and targets of SARS-CoV-2 infection in post-mortem patient brains and human fetal tissue.\nWe found that persistent hypotestosteronaemia in some men could indeed be of hypothalamic origin, favouring post-COVID cognitive or neurological symptoms, and that changes in testosterone levels and body weight over time were inversely correlated. Infection of olfactory sensory neurons and multifunctional hypothalamic glia called tanycytes highlighted at least two viable neuroinvasion routes. Furthermore, GnRH neurons themselves were dying in all patient brains studied, dramatically reducing GnRH expression. Human fetal olfactory and vomeronasal epithelia, from which GnRH neurons arise, and fetal GnRH neurons also appeared susceptible to infection.\nPutative GnRH neuron and tanycyte dysfunction following SARS-CoV-2 neuroinvasion could be responsible for serious reproductive, metabolic, and mental health consequences in long-COVID and lead to an increased risk of neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative pathologies over time in all age groups.\nEuropean Research Council (ERC) grant agreements No 810331, No 725149, No 804236, the European Union Horizon 2020 research and innovation program No 847941, the Fondation pour la Recherche M\u00e9dicale (FRM) and the Agence Nationale de la Recherche en Sant\u00e9 (ANRS) No ECTZ200878 Long Covid 2021 ANRS0167 SIGNAL, Agence Nationale de la recherche (ANR) grant agreements No ANR-19-CE16-0021-02, No ANR-11-LABEX-0009, No. ANR-10-LABEX-0046, No. ANR-16-IDEX-0004, Inserm Cross-Cutting Scientific Program HuDeCA, the CHU Lille Bonus H, the UK Medical Research Council (MRC) and National Institute of Health and care Research (NIHR).",

In addition, recent findings have shown sex-specific actions of neuroestradiol on neuroblast migration, neuritic growth and synaptogenesis in females. Among other factors, the epigenetic regulation exerted by\u00a0X\u00a0linked genes, such as Kdm6a/Utx, may determine sex-specific actions of neuroestradiol in the female brain.

        "abstract": "Clinical scientists have been investigating the relationships between sex hormones, personality, and eating disorders for decades. However, there is a lack of direct research that addresses whether personality mediates or moderates the relationships between sex hormones and eating pathology. Moreover, the neural mechanisms that underlie the interactive associations between these variables remain unclear. This review aims to summarize the associations between these constructs, describe a neural mechanism mediating these relationships, and offer clinical strategies for the early identification and intervention of eating disorders. The gathered evidence shows that aggressiveness, impulsivity, and obsessive-compulsiveness may mediate or moderate the relationships between sex hormones and eating pathology, but only among females. Furthermore, sex hormone receptor density in the mesocorticolimbic dopamine pathway may explain the neural mechanism of these associations. Future research should use more comprehensive personality measurements and assess the mediation and moderation effects of temperament while taking the hormone levels of women across menstrual cycles into account. Additionally, electroencephalography and functional magnetic resonance imaging should be implemented to directly assess brain activity and corroborate these findings.",

        "abstract": "A paradox of testosterone effects is seen in adolescents versus adults in social emotional approach-avoidance behavior. During adolescence, high testosterone levels are associated with increased anterior prefrontal (aPFC) involvement in emotion control, whereas during adulthood this neuro-endocrine relation is reversed. Rodent work shows that, during puberty, testosterone transitions from a neuro-developmental to a social-sexual activating hormone. In this study, we explored whether this functional transition is also present in human adolescents and young adults. Using a prospective longitudinal design, we investigated the role of testosterone on neural control of social emotional behavior during the transitions from middle to late adolescence and into young adulthood. Seventy-one individuals (tested at ages 14, 17, and 20 years) performed an fMRI-adapted approach-avoidance (AA) task involving automatic and controlled actions in response to social emotional stimuli. In line with predictions from animal models, the effect of testosterone on aPFC engagement decreased between middle and late adolescence, and shifted into an activational role by young adulthood-impeding neural control of emotions. This change in testosterone function was accompanied by increased testosterone-modulated amygdala reactivity. These findings qualify the testosterone-dependent maturation of the prefrontal-amygdala circuit supporting emotion control during the transition from middle adolescence into young adulthood.",

        "abstract": "Exposure to phthalates and non-phthalate plasticizers as well as bisphenols may be relevant to the development of behavioural symptoms in childhood with sex-specific effects, although the results of existing studies are not consistent. The aim of the study was to evaluate the cross-sectional association between childhood exposure to these compounds and behavioral outcomes in the REPRO_PL cohort (Poland).\nBehavioral assessments were performed at the age of 7-9 years\u00a0by parents using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ). HPLC-MS/MS was used for the quantification of BPA and 21 phthalate metabolites corresponding to 11 phthalate compounds (n\u2009=\u2009400) and their replacement alternatives BPF, BPS, three metabolites of diethylhexyl terephthalate (DEHTP) and three metabolites of di-isononyl-cyclohexane-1,2-dicarboxylate (DINCH) (n\u2009=\u2009150). Multivariable linear regression models accounting for sex-specific effects as well as sex-adjusted models were applied, using both separate models for each metabolite (or sum of metabolites) and joint models. In addition, mixtures models adjusted by the three chemical groups studied were also performed.\nMedian concentrations of several phthalate metabolites and bisphenols were of 42\u00a0\u00b5g/L (MEP), 4.5\u00a0\u00b5g/L (MMP), 3.5\u00a0\u00b5g/L (\u03a3DiDP), 2\u00a0\u00b5g/L (BPA) and 1\u00a0\u00b5g/L (BPF). For \u03a3DEHTP and \u03a3DINCH, the median concentrations were 35\u00a0\u00b5g/L and 3.1\u00a0\u00b5g/L, respectively. Exposure to phthalates was related to behavioral problems in girls, and bisphenols and DEHTP in boys. Among girls, DiBP was associated with mental health problems (total difficulties: \u03b2\u2009=\u20094.84; 95% CI 0.72;8.96, emotional: \u03b2\u2009=\u20092.14; 95% CI 0.33;4.0, hyperactivity/inattention: \u03b2\u2009=\u20092.52; 95% CI 0.55;4.49, externalizing behavior: (\u03b2\u2009=\u20092.95; 95% CI 0.36;5.53) and DiDP with hyperactivity/inattention scores (\u03b2\u2009=\u20092.46; 95% CI 0.30;4.63). BPF was associated with emotional problems and internalizing behavior among boys in both main and sensitivity models (main model: \u03b2\u2009=\u20091.03; 95% CI -0.16;2.21 and \u03b2\u2009=\u20091.71; 95% CI -0.14;3.56 respectively).\nThis study shows that children's exposure to several replacement compounds of BPA and phthalates, such as BPF and DEHTP, are associated with adverse effects on school-age children's behavior, with a divergent sex-specific effect. In any case, mixture models did not provide any further insight on the aforementioned cross-sectional associations and further methodological approaches are needed to explore adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes in children and teenagers.",

Its higher prevalence in males underscores the importance of understanding potential sex-specific differences. Prenatal exposure to valproic acid (VPA) is a widely used preclinical model to induce ASD-like traits in rodents; however, few studies have systematically compared neurobehavioral outcomes in both sexes. Here, we aimed to investigate sex-specific variations in developmental, behavioral, and physiological parameters in Wistar rat offspring prenatally exposed to VPA. Pregnant rats received a single intraperitoneal injection of VPA (600\u2005mg/kg) or saline on gestational day (GD) 12.5, and offspring were assigned to four groups: control males, control females, VPA males, and females (n\u2005=\u20059 per group). VPA-exposed rats of both sexes exhibited autism-like behaviors, including heightened anxiety, increased exploratory activity, repetitive behaviors, social deficits, spatial and recognition memory impairments, and depressive-like traits. Physiological assessments revealed altered gastrointestinal (GIT) motility, increased brain edema, impaired blood-brain barrier (BBB) function, and neuronal injury with no sex-based difference in estrogen \u03b2 (ER\u03b2/ESR2) mRNA expression. These findings demonstrate that in utero exposure to VPA induces autism-like behaviors, developmental abnormalities, and neurodegenerative changes in both rat sexes, emphasizing the importance of including females in preclinical ASD research.",

However, limited epidemiological studies have examined the neurodevelopmental effects of co-exposure to them during the first trimester on offspring and their inflammatory mechanism. This study investigates how maternal inflammation mediates the relationship between first-trimester co-exposure to BPA and PAEs and infant neurodevelopment.\nWe analyzed 176 mother-child pairs. Maternal exposure to BPA and PAEs (mono-n-butyl phthalate [MBP], monoethyl phthalate [MEP], mono (2-ethylhexyl) phthalate [MEHP]) and 6 types of inflammatory markers were measured in early pregnancy. Infant neurodevelopment was assessed with the Griffiths Development Scales-Chinese. Associations were examined using Spearman correlation, Bayesian kernel machine regression (BKMR), and causal mediation analysis (BKMR-CMA), considering maternal pregestational BMI as a modifier.\nDuring the first trimester, BPA positively correlated with TNF-\u0251 and CRP, while MEHP was positively associated with IL-1\u03b2. High BPA, MBP, and MEHP levels were negatively linked to infant personal-social development, MEHP was significantly associated with impaired language development. Mediation analysis showed that for personal-social ability, TNF-\u0251 (4.80\u202f%) and IL-1\u03b2 (24.68\u202f%) mediated the effect of mixed exposure at the 75th BMI percentile, while CRP mediated at the 25th (1.35\u202f%) and 75th (11.82\u202f%) percentiles. For language development, at the 25th BMI percentile, TNF-\u0251(28.19\u202f%), IL-1\u03b2(50.00\u202f%), and CRP (9.10\u202f%) were significant mediators.\nEarly pregnancy prenatal BPA and PAE exposure may be associated with delayed personal social and language development, possibly mediated by maternal TNF-\u0251, IL-1\u03b2, and CRP, especially in women with inadequate pre-pregnancy BMI.",

WES libraries were prepared and sequenced to an average depth of 100\u00d7. Raw reads underwent stringent quality control, alignment, variant calling, and annotation against public databases (gnomAD, ClinVar). Rare (minor allele frequency [MAF]\u2009<\u20091%) high-confidence variants were filtered to focus on exonic, splice-site, and insertion and deletion (indel) events. Candidate genes were subjected to Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment and Gene Ontology (GO) analyses to identify overrepresented neural development pathways, with particular emphasis on estrogen receptor-mediated signaling.\nA total of 479 rare, potentially pathogenic variants across 19 estrogen receptor-mediated neurodevelopmental genes were identified for further validation.\nAfter quality control, 266\u2009265 high-confidence variants were retained; of 217\u2009757 exomic calls, 48\u2009508 (22.3%) were exonic (49.8% nonsynonymous), including 4.1% splice-site, 225 missense, 27 nonsense, 43 frameshift, and various indels. KEGG analysis highlighted significant enrichment in axon guidance signaling, while GO terms pointed to neuronal projection and synaptic assembly. Nineteen genes within the estrogen receptor pathway harbored rare deleterious variants, suggesting disruptions in sex hormone-driven neural differentiation.\nThis WES-based framework enables the identification of novel candidate loci for diagnostic panels and may inform personalized interventions for gender identity-related anxiety.\nThis study leveraged high-depth whole-exome sequencing, stringent bioinformatics filtering, and a pathway-focused approach to pinpoint rare variants in sex-dimorphic neurodevelopmental genes; however, its small sample size, lack of functional validation, potential population stratification bias, and cross-sectional design limit causal inference.\nOur integrated WES and bioinformatics pipeline uncovers rare variants in estrogen receptor-mediated neurodevelopmental genes, providing new insights into the genetic architecture of sex-dimorphic brain development and its role in gender identity-related anxiety.\nThe article was registered at the ISRCTN Registry https://www.isrctn.com/ISRCTN18336816 (no. 18336816) under an observational study record.",

        "abstract": "Bisphenols (BPs) are widely used in plastic manufacturing, food packaging, and other industrial applications, with bisphenol A (BPA) being one of the most extensively produced chemicals globally. However, due to its endocrine-disrupting properties, BPA has been linked to reproductive abnormalities, metabolic disorders, neurodevelopmental impairments, and other adverse health effects, leading to regulatory restrictions. These restrictions have resulted in increased usage of BPA alternatives and thus exposure to the alternatives, whose toxicity thresholds remain insufficiently characterized. To address this gap, this study derived reference doses (RfDs) for five BPA alternatives, i.e., bisphenol B (BPB), bisphenol P (BPP), bisphenol Z (BPZ), bisphenol AF (BPAF), and bisphenol AP (BPAP), by integrating epidemiological data and animal experiments. The RfDs were calculated using Benchmark Dose (BMD) modeling and no observed adverse effect level/lowest observed adverse effect level (NOAEL/LOAEL) approaches, combined with uncertainty analysis to quantify risk metrics. The results demonstrated that the BMD-derived RfDs for BPB, BPP, and BPZ were 1.05, 0.23, and 5.13\u202f\u03bcg/kg-bw/day, respectively, while the NOAEL/LOAEL-based RfDs for BPAF and BPAP were 0.04 and 2.31\u202fng/kg-bw/day. By refining toxicity thresholds and risk assessment methodologies, this study not only highlights the potential health risks posed by BPs but also supports evidence-based policymaking to safeguard public health.",

This study aimed to investigate BPA exposure at 1 and 6 months of age and its correlation with neurodevelopmental scores at 2 years of age, focusing on age-specific effects and potential sex differences. In the cohort study conducted from May 2021 to December 2023, urine samples were collected from infants at 1 and 6 months, followed by neurodevelopmental assessments at 2 years of age. Of the 240 and 210 urine samples collected at 1 and 6 months, urinary BPA was detected via liquid chromatographytandem mass spectrometry in 93.7 and 93.8\u202f%, with median concentrations of 2.79 and 4.04\u202f\u03bcg/L, respectively. At the 1-month assessment, no statistically significant associations were observed between urinary BPA concentrations and any neurodevelopmental outcomes in either male or female infants (all adjusted P\u202f>\u202f0.05). However, at the 6-month assessment, significant inverse associations were identified exclusively in female infants. Specifically, higher urinary BPA concentrations at 6 months were independently associated with lower scores in the gross motor domain (adjusted \u03b2 = -3.33; 95\u202f% CI: -6.36, -0.30; P\u202f=\u202f0.032), adaptive behavior domain (adjusted \u03b2 = -5.01; 95\u202f% CI: -9.28, -0.74; P\u202f=\u202f0.022), personal-social skills (adjusted \u03b2 = -6.12; 95\u202f% CI: -11.29, -0.94; P\u202f=\u202f0.021), and the total neurodevelopmental score (adjusted \u03b2 = -4.21; 95\u202f% CI: -8.02, -0.40; P\u202f=\u202f0.031) after controlling for relevant confounders. In contrast, no significant associations were detected between 6-month BPA concentrations and neurodevelopmental outcomes in male infants (all adjusted P\u202f>\u202f0.05).

This review by the Eunethydis Special Interest Group on Female ADHD, addresses current knowledge and identifies research gaps for future work. Issues in women with ADHD across the lifespan such as late diagnosis, pubertal development, sexual health, hormonal birth control, executive function difficulties, and gynaecological disorders associated with ADHD are highlighted.\nThe review synthesises existing literature and self-reported experiences of women with ADHD to explore the impact of hormonal fluctuations [puberty, menstrual cycle, pregnancy, (peri)menopause] on ADHD symptoms and mood disturbances. It examines the interplay of oestrogen and progesterone with dopaminergic pathways, when periods of lower oestrogen may affect cognition, as well as the manifestation of executive function deficits, and the intersection of ADHD with reproductive health.\nHormonal transitions exacerbate ADHD symptoms and mood disturbances, yet pharmacological research and tailored treatments are lacking. Executive function deficits manifest differently in girls and women with ADHD and are influenced by neuropsychological and neurobiological profiles. Diagnostic practices and sociocultural factors contribute to delayed diagnoses, increasing the risk of comorbidities, impaired functioning, and diminished quality of life. Undiagnosed women have increased vulnerability to premenstrual dysphoric disorder, postpartum depression, and cardiovascular disease during perimenopause.\nLongitudinal, sex-specific studies incorporating hormonal status and lived experience are needed. Individualised interventions should be developed to address the unique needs of girls and women with ADHD. Addressing these gaps will advance more equitable diagnosis, management, and support for girls and women with ADHD, improving outcomes across the female lifespan.",

Evidence supports all of the mechanisms tested, except Y-linkage, as contributors to sex-biased miRNA expression.

        "abstract": "Prenatal exposure to bisphenol A (BPA), a common endocrine disruptor, has been increasingly implicated in neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism spectrum disorder. This study explores the molecular mechanisms by which prenatal BPA exposure affects alternative RNA splicing in the prefrontal cortex and investigates the potential link between alternative RNA splicing and autism-related behaviors in rat offspring. Using RNA sequencing and high-resolution melting real-time PCR, we identified differentially alternative splicing events associated with autism candidate genes. Gene ontology and pathway analyses revealed significant enrichment of differentially alternative splicing genes and neurological pathways relevant to autism. BPA appears to act through autism-related transcription factors, affecting RNA-binding proteins. Altered expressions of these RNA-binding proteins influenced alternative RNA splicing events within key autism-related genes, implicating them in disrupted synaptogenesis. Behavioral analyses of offspring exposed to BPA revealed autism-associated traits, including hyperactivity, anxiety, and aggression, which correlated with the observed sex-specific alternative RNA splicing patterns. These findings suggest that BPA-induced alterations of transcription factors and RNA-binding proteins affect alternative RNA splicing and synaptic development, potentially contributing to autism pathophysiology. This research underscores the role of environmental factors in autism etiology and highlights the importance of awareness and preventive measures against prenatal BPA exposure.",

        "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common form of dementia, is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by memory loss and cognitive decline. In addition to its two major pathological hallmarks, extracellular amyloid beta (A\u03b2) plaques and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), recent evidence highlights the critical roles of mitochondrial dysfunction and neuroinflammation in disease progression. A\u03b2 impairs mitochondrial function, which, in part, can subsequently trigger inflammatory cascades, creating a vicious cycle of neuronal damage. Estrogen receptors (ERs) are widely expressed throughout the brain, and the sex hormone 17\u03b2-estradiol (E2) exerts neuroprotection through both anti-inflammatory and mitochondrial mechanisms. While E2 exhibits neuroprotective properties, its mechanisms against A\u03b2 toxicity remain incompletely understood. In this study, we investigated the neuroprotective effects of E2 against A\u03b2-induced mitochondrial dysfunction and neuroinflammation in primary cortical neurons, with a particular focus on the role of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). We found that E2 treatment significantly increased phosphorylated AMPK and upregulated the expression of mitochondrial biogenesis regulator peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator-1 \u03b1 (PGC-1\u03b1), leading to improved mitochondrial respiration. In contrast, A\u03b2 suppressed AMPK and PGC-1\u03b1 signaling, impaired mitochondrial function, activated the pro-inflammatory nuclear factor kappa-light-chain enhancer of activated B cells (NF-\u03baB), and reduced neuronal viability. E2 pretreatment also rescued A\u03b2-induced mitochondrial dysfunction, suppressed NF-\u03baB activation, and, importantly, prevented the decline in neuronal viability. However, the pharmacological inhibition of AMPK using Compound C (CC) abolished these protective effects, resulting in mitochondrial collapse, elevated inflammation, and cell death, highlighting AMPK's critical role in mediating E2's actions. Interestingly, while NF-\u03baB inhibition using BAY 11-7082 partially restored mitochondrial respiration, it failed to prevent A\u03b2-induced cytotoxicity, suggesting that E2's full neuroprotective effects rely on broader AMPK-dependent mechanisms beyond NF-\u03baB suppression alone. Together, these findings establish AMPK as a key mediator of E2's protective effects against A\u03b2-driven mitochondrial dysfunction and neuroinflammation, providing new insights into estrogen-based therapeutic strategies for AD.",

        "doi": "10.1016/j.mcn.2025.104028",
        "abstract": "Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) exhibits a clear male bias, with males being approximately four times more likely to be affected than females. This difference has sparked curiosity about possible neurological elements that provide protection to females. One such neurological element that has shown promise is brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), essential for neuronal development, synaptic plasticity, and neuroprotection. ASD may be less common in females due to increased BDNF levels, which may be influenced by sex-specific epigenetic control and estrogen hormone. Research studies indicate that increased baseline BDNF in females promotes neurodevelopmental resilience and mitigates the environmental and genetic risk factors linked to ASD. Also, this protective impact may be enhanced by the regulatory function of estrogen in BDNF expression and the interaction of BDNF with X-linked genes. The processes by which BDNF contributes to sex differences are still not well understood despite strong evidence. Interpreting results is made more difficult by the variability of ASD symptoms and variations in study methodologies. In addition to that, it is yet unknown whether increased BDNF levels represent compensatory processes or actually provide protection. Longitudinal studies that monitor BDNF expression across developmental stages and look at sex-specific treatment approaches that target BDNF pathways should be the main focus of future research. Thus, a thorough understanding of how BDNF prevents sex differences in ASD may pave the way for innovative strategies destined to diminish the risk of ASD. In this milieu, this review explores the current research, highlighting the complex relationship between sex differences, BDNF, and the incidence of ASD.",

        "doi": "10.3390/ijms26125685",
        "abstract": "Bisphenol AF (BPAF) is widely utilized as an analog of bisphenol A (BPA) in the plastics industry. However, there is limited evidence on its neurodevelopmental toxicity. Existing studies suggest that BPAF has greater accumulation in vivo than other bisphenol analogs, and could pass through the placental barrier and the blood-brain barrier. In this study, we used the human neural progenitor cells line ReNcell CX, which was derived from 14-week human cortical brain tissue, as an in vitro model to investigate the neurodevelopmental toxicity effects of BPAF and BPA on ReNcell CX cells, and explored the possible mechanism by which BPAF induced neurodevelopmental toxicity on ReNcell CX cells. The results showed that BPAF reduced the proliferation of neural progenitor cells and changed the differentiation towards neurons after exposure for 24 h. Compared with BPA, ReNcell CX cells are more susceptible to BPAF exposure. In a 3D neurospheres model, BPAF affected the distance that neurons migrated outwards at the concentration of 2 \u03bcM. Furthermore, BPAF increased ROS levels in cells and reduced the expression of key proteins in the Nrf2/HO-1 pathway and its downstream molecules, such as SOD, GSH, and CAT. In conclusion, BPAF induces damage to critical nodes in neural progenitor cell development through the Nrf2/HO-1 pathway. Therefore, clarifying its neurodevelopmental toxicity and elaborating on the neurodevelopmental toxicity effects and mechanisms of bisphenol AF will help identify intervention targets for neurodevelopmental toxicity, and will have important public health significance for the safety assessment and risk prediction of bisphenol-related chemicals.",

This study aims to review the preventive and therapeutic effects of Resveratrol (RSV) against ASD during various stages of life, specifically focusing on its influence on behavioral and neurodevelopmental biochemical mechanisms.\nOn December 6, 2024, a comprehensive electronic search was conducted across several high-coverage databases, including Web of Science, Scopus, PubMed/MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Library. The most important data were extracted and reviewed after screening the publications based on our inclusion and exclusion criteria.\nRSV alleviates autistic-like social behaviors by promoting social interaction and mitigating repetitive behaviors, anxiety, and symptoms resembling depression. RSV influences chemokine receptor expression, diminishes pro-inflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and interferon-gamma (IFN-\u03b3), and regulates mitochondrial function by reducing nitrosative stress and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) levels, while also increasing antioxidant markers like glutathione (GSH), catalase (CAT), and superoxide dismutase (SOD) in the brain. Additionally, it enhances neuronal organization, increases the proportions of interneurons (SOM+, PV+, CB+), and restores the integrity of the hippocampus. Moreover, RSV modulates epigenetic pathways, such as estrogen receptorbeta (ER\u03b2) activation and sirtuin 1 (Sirt1) expression, counteracts learning, memory, and locomotor activity deficits, and normalizes cortical oscillations. It also potentially modulated gutbrain- axis dysregulation and neurotransmitters.\nRSV has shown promising effects on ASD, primarily through its influence on behavioral, neuromolecular, and neurodevelopmental mechanisms.",

        "abstract": "Bisphenol A (BPA), a prevalent environmental pollutant found in plastics and food packaging, has been associated with neurotoxicity and epigenetic dysregulation throughout successive generations. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), a crucial controller of gene expression, are especially susceptible to alterations caused by BPA, which may change transcriptional and post-transcriptional processes. However, the exact mechanism by which lncRNAs interact with BPA remains unclear. Using Drosophila melanogaster and mice as model organisms, this review focuses on BPA driving the dysregulation of lncRNAs and their role in mediating changes in gene expression. This comprehensive review elucidates the potential of natural compounds in mitigating BPA-induced health risks, particularly focusing on neurological development. It also underscores the critical importance of minimizing BPA exposure through the promotion of BPA-free alternatives and reduced plastic consumption as imperative public health strategies.",

        "doi": "10.1002/jnr.70049",
        "abstract": "Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a complex neurodevelopmental condition characterized by social deficits, restricted interest, and repetitive behaviors. The prevalence is higher in males (4:1). FDA-approved drugs, Aripiprazole, and risperidone, only target comorbid conditions and have significant side effects. Dysregulation in cAMP-responsive element-binding protein (CREB) signaling is reported in autistic individuals. Forskolin is traditionally used in Ayurvedic medicine with lesser side effects. It is a potent adenylyl cyclase (AC) activator, increases intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels, thereby activating the protein kinase A (PKA)/CREB pathway with clinically proven benefits as an anticancer, anti-asthmatic, and in metabolic disorder, and crosses the blood-brain-barrier (BBB) junction. The present study aimed to investigate the impact of Forskolin and sought to explore the role of estrogen beta (ER\u03b2/ESR2) receptors in a valproic acid (VPA) model of ASD. Pregnant Wistar rats received VPA or an equal volume of saline on gestational day (GD) 12.5. From postnatal day (PND) 23, male and female rats were divided separately into control, VPA, risperidone, and Forskolin (10-30\u2009mg/kg) groups. Systemic administration of Forskolin ameliorated anxiety, social deficit, repetitive behavior, spatial recognition memory, motor coordination, gastrointestinal (GIT) motility, brain edema, and BBB permeability in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, chronic Forskolin treatment significantly alleviated VPA-induced neuronal damage in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), hippocampus (HC), and cerebellum, and increased the intracellular CREB ser133 protein phosphorylation. Forskolin upregulated the mRNA expression of CREB signaling, which was altered by prenatal VPA administration. Our findings indicate that Forskolin provides neuroprotection through CREB signaling, suggesting its therapeutic potential for ASD.",

Gestational dietary soy prevents alcohol-related impairments in placentation and FASD-associated fetal anomalies.\nThis study was designed to determine if gestational dietary soy would be sufficient to normalize cognitive function in young adolescent offspring after chronic in utero exposure to alcohol. In addition, efforts were made to characterize the mechanisms of FASD prevention by maternal dietary soy.\nPregnant Long Evans rats were fed isocaloric liquid diets containing 0% or 26% caloric ethanol with casein or soy isolate as the protein source from gestation day 6 through delivery/postnatal day 0 (P0). From P24 - P28, the offspring were subjected to Morris water maze (MWM) testing, and on P35, they were sacrificed to harvest temporal lobes for histopathologic and molecular studies.\nThe in-utero ethanol-exposed offspring exhibited significant performance impairments on the MWM test, and they had a significantly reduced mean brain weight with neuronal loss in the CA1 hippocampal region and evidence of white matter myelin loss. Gestational dietary soy nearly normalized MWM performance and preserved brain weight, hippocampal CA1 architecture, and white matter myelin staining in alcohol-exposed offspring. Mechanistically, the main positive effects of soy included increased temporal lobe expression of HES-1 and HIF-1\nDietary soy intervention early in pregnancy may reduce FASD-associated cognitive deficits. The findings suggest that targeting Notch and GnRH-related networks may help reduce long-term disability with FASD. Additional mechanistic and experimental research is needed to determine if longer-duration, postnatal dietary soy could prevent the adverse neurobehavioral effects of FASD.",

        "abstract": "Deletion of the long arm of chromosome 6 (6q deletion syndrome) is a rare chromosomal abnormality that can lead to a variety of neurodevelopmental and physical impairments. Clinical manifestations vary widely depending on the size and location of the deletion, often including developmental delay, hypotonia, and craniofacial dysmorphism.\nWe present the case of a 2-year-old female with a history of delayed psychomotor development and poor sleep patterns. The patient had been receiving outpatient growth hormone injections prior to presentation. Upon referral to our clinic at age two, comprehensive clinical and laboratory evaluations were performed. Physical examination revealed hypotonia, developmental delay, and subtle craniofacial abnormalities. Chromosomal analysis confirmed a diagnosis of 6q27 deletion syndrome.\nAlthough rare, 6q deletion syndrome should be considered in children presenting with global developmental delay, hypotonia, and atypical facial features. Early diagnosis via karyotyping or chromosomal microarray is critical for appropriate genetic counseling and tailored intervention.\nThis case underscores the importance of early clinical suspicion and genetic testing in infants with unexplained developmental delays. Prompt diagnosis can guide therapeutic strategies and family support planning.",

It has been shown that missense variants in the GEF1 or GEF2 domains or loss-of-function variants in TRIO are associated with microcephaly while gain-of-function variants in the spectrin repeat domain result in macrocephaly. Rare cases of macrocephaly linked to missense variants in the GEF1 domain have been reported; however, clinical details remain limited.\nWe describe the case of a Japanese boy with macrocephaly, severe intellectual disability, distinctive facial features, scoliosis, and growth hormone deficiency. Brain magnetic resonance imaging revealed a thin corpus callosum and pituitary hypoplasia. His occipitofrontal circumference was +2.5 standard deviations above the normal range, while his height and weight were below the average. He displayed many features characteristic of TRIO-related neurodevelopmental disorders caused by gain-of-function variants. However, trio-based exome sequencing identified a de novo missense variant (instead of gain-of-function variant) in the GEF1 domain of TRIO (NM_007118.4:c.4104T>A, p.(Asp1368Glu)).\nThis case expands the phenotypic spectrum of TRIO-related neurodevelopmental disorders, highlighting macrocephaly associated with a missense variant in the GEF1 domain.

        "abstract": "KBG syndrome is one of the most frequent neurodevelopmental disorders and is caused by ANKRD11 variants. Postnatal short stature is observed in ~50% of patients. Recombinant human growth hormone (rhGH) has become a valuable treatment for patients with growth hormone deficiency (GHD) along with Prader-Willi and Turner syndrome. Limited evidence suggests benefits for some patients with KBG syndrome, but systematic analysis and detailed phenotyping are lacking. In this study, we include six unpublished patients with KBG syndrome treated with rhGH and 22 patients from the literature. At treatment start, 43% had GHD. Median height before treatment was -2.9 standard deviation score (SDS) which increased to -1.8 SDS at the latest measurement. Moreover, half of the patients showed height gains of \u2265\u20091 SDS and 10/18 patients with short stature before treatment achieved heights within normal ranges following treatment or at the latest available measurement. Of interest, the difference between pre-treatment height SDS and that at the latest measurement (\u2206HSDS) was comparable for patients with and without GHD. This study represents the largest group of patients with KBG syndrome treated with rhGH so far and suggests that rhGH treatment has a positive impact on height, as indicated by \u2206HSDS, in a subset of patients.",

Substances inducing thyroid histopathological and/or thyroid hormone effects in rodent studies need to be further investigated to rule out whether the substance can be considered as an endocrine disruptor for the thyroid pathway, including neurodevelopmental impact in pups and its relevance in humans. Histopathological assessment for identifying reliable biomarkers for assessing neurodevelopmental effects is an important aspect of this testing scheme in rats. Periventricular heterotopia in the corpus callosum and persistence of the external granular layer in the cerebellum have been proposed as potential histopathological biomarkers in the brain. The correlation in the cochlea for hearing impairment seen in rat pups derived from hypothyroid dams is another potential biomarker. Herein, we provide a brief overview of the histopathological endpoints. The technical challenges in correctly identifying these changes during brain development and their significance in detecting the impact of maternal hypothyroidism in rodents are discussed.

        "abstract": "Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are common neurodevelopmental disorders, mainly caused by disrupted excitation/inhibition balance and synaptic plasticity. Intermittent theta burst stimulation (iTBS) is a variant of excitatory repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation, inducing long-term potentiation-like plasticity. In recent years, there has been a growing interest in high-dose iTBS as a therapeutic tool for psychiatric disorders. We aim to preliminarily investigate the feasibility, safety, and efficacy of high-dose iTBS in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD).\nA randomized controlled pilot trial with a 4-week intervention will be conducted. Forty children with ASD will be randomized into either the intervention or control group. The intervention group will receive 5400-pulse iTBS per day, while the control group will receive sham iTBS. Feasibility will be evaluated through recruitment, intervention adherence, and assessment completion. Safety will be assessed by comparing the rates of drop-outs attributed to adverse events and the rates of serious adverse events The efficacy outcomes include the Autism Behavior Checklist, Social Responsiveness Scale, 2nd Edition, Childhood Autism Rating Scale, Autism Treatment Evaluation Checklist and Repetitive Behavior Scale-Revised. Resting-state electroencephalogram and functional near-infrared spectroscopy will be employed to quantify alterations in functional brain connectivity and cerebral haemodynamics. Salivary levels of oxytocin, growth hormone, insulin-like growth factor 1, and insulin-like growth factor binding protein 3 are measured to reflect the biochemical response to iTBS. These indicators will be assessed at baseline and at the end of the intervention.\nThis trial will evaluate the feasibility, safety, and efficacy of high-dose iTBS treatment in children with ASD. The proposed study will provide pilot data to inform the feasibility and design of larger sample-size trials.\nhttp://www.chictr.org.cn, identifier ChiCTR2400089757.",

        "abstract": "In recent years, the importance of placental function for fetal neurodevelopment has become increasingly studied. This field, known as neuroplacentology, has greatly expanded possible etiologies of neurodevelopmental disorders by exploring the influence of placental function on brain development. It is also well-established that brain development is influenced by craniofacial morphogenesis. However, there is less focus on the impact of the placenta on craniofacial development. Recent research suggests the functional influence of placental nutrients and hormones on craniofacial skeletal growth, such as prolactin, growth hormone, insulin-like growth factor 1, vitamin D, sulfate, and calcium, impacting both craniofacial and brain development. Therefore, interactions between the placenta and both fetal neurodevelopment and craniofacial development likely influence the growth and morphology of the head as a whole. This review discusses the role of placental hormone production and nutrient delivery in the development of the fetal head-defined as craniofacial and brain tissue together-expanding on the more established focus on brain development to also include the skull (or cranium) and face.",

        "doi": "10.1080/10408444.2025.2461076",
        "abstract": "Thyroid hormone (TH) is crucial for proper neurodevelopment. Insufficient TH concentrations in early life are associated with lower IQ and delayed motor development in children. Intracellular levels of TH are modulated via the transmembrane transport of TH and intracellular deiodination, and can mediate gene transcription via binding to the nuclear TH receptor. Chemical exposure can disrupt TH homeostasis via modes of action targeting intracellular mechanisms, thereby potentially influencing TH transport, deiodination or signaling. Understanding the cause and effect relationships of chemical hazards interfering with TH homeostasis in the developing brain is necessary to identify how chemicals might disturb brain development and result in neurodevelopmental disorders. Adverse Outcome Pathways (AOPs) can provide a template for mapping these relationships, and so far multiple AOPs have been developed for TH homeostasis and adverse effects on cognition. The present review aims to expand current AOP networks by (1) summarizing the most important factors in the regulation of brain development under influence of TH, (2) integrating human-based mechanistic information of biological pathways which can be disturbed by TH disrupting chemicals, and (3) by incorporating brain-specific TH-mediated physiology, including barriers and cell specificity, as well as clinical knowledge. TH-specific pathways in the fetal brain are highlighted and supported by distinguishing cell type specific Molecular Initiating Events (MIEs) and downstream Key Events (KEs) for astrocytes, neurons and oligodendrocytes. Two main pathways leading to adverse outcomes (AOs) in the areas of 'cognition' and 'motor function' are decreased myelination due to oligodendrocyte dysfunction, and decreased synaptogenesis and network formation via the neurons. The proposed AOP framework can form a basis for selecting developmental neurotoxic ",

        "abstract": "Prader-Willi syndrome is a rare neurodevelopmental disorder that impacts the musculoskeletal, endocrine, pulmonary, neurologic, ocular, and gastrointestinal systems. In addition, individuals with Prader-Willi syndrome have issues with cognitive development, characteristic behavioral problems, and perhaps most profoundly, appetite control. Currently, the only US Food and Drug Administration-approved therapy for Prader-Willi syndrome is growth hormone, which has been Food and Drug Administration approved for >\u00a020 years for the treatment of growth failure in Prader-Willi syndrome. Growth hormone has shown to improve many aspects of this syndrome, including final height, body composition, developmental milestones, and cognition, but it does not affect hyperphagia, which is the hallmark symptom of this condition. Over the past 15 years, there have been several medication trials for the treatment of hyperphagia in Prader-Willi syndrome, but thus far, all have failed to achieve Food and Drug Administration approval for a variety of reasons. However, hyperphagia is the most life-limiting symptom of Prader-Willi syndrome, thus new pharmacologic therapies are desperately needed. We review ongoing and recently completed clinical trials for hyperphagia. Other issues in Prader-Willi syndrome that significantly impact quality of life include excessive daytime sleepiness and severe behavioral problems. We examine the medication trials to address these issues.",

Epigenetic mechanisms may play a crucial role in the interplay between genetic and environmental factors in the pathogenesis of ASD. In addition to language delay, pediatricians should monitor and screen for several early signs of ASD. Differential diagnosis is complex because several neurodevelopmental conditions show clinical features that overlap with ASD.

In the full cohort, we used Cox regression to examine the associations between release from imprisonment and all-cause mortality. In a subcohort of those released from prison, we used Poisson regression to examine the associations between receipt of disability services and post-release all-cause mortality.\n3.3% of participants (n=2214) were imprisoned and released at least once during follow-up. In all age groups<55 years, age-specific all-cause mortality rates were higher in those released from prison than in those who were not imprisoned. In Cox regression models, after adjusting for sociodemographic factors, release from prison was associated with higher all-cause mortality compared with never imprisonment (adjusted HR (aHR) 1.50 (95% CI 1.17 to 1.92)); however, this association was no longer present after further adjustment for mental illness, substance use and physical comorbidity (aHR 1.02 (95% CI 0.79 to 1.31)). Among those released from prison, being known to the prison disability service was associated with higher post-release mortality (adjusted mortality rate ratio (aMRR) 1.97 (95% CI 1.18 to 3.30)), whereas receipt of community disability services was not associated with post-release mortality (aMRR 1.09 (95% CI 0.55 to 2.15)).\nAmong adults with neurodevelopmental disabilities, mortality was increased among those released from prison compared with their peers who had not been imprisoned, although this was largely explained by health-related factors, including mental illness, substance use and physical comorbidity.

        "abstract": "Childhood trauma exposure is associated with the development of psychiatric disorders including Eating Disorders (EDs) and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). A systematic review of comorbid PTSD and EDs in adults found relatively high prevalence rates of this comorbidity and more severe ED symptoms associated with this comorbidity. However, there has been less focus on comorbid PTSD and ED in children and young people, despite this group's increased susceptibility to psychiatric conditions due to their neurodevelopmental sensitivity. This systematic review aimed to synthesise research on co-occurring PTSD and EDs in children and young people (the latter group defined by the World Health Organisation-WHO-as aged 10-25\u00a0years), examining prevalence, aetiology, and treatment. Six electronic databases (PubMed, PsychInfo, Scopus, APA PsychNET, Web of Science and Embase) were searched for articles published from 1990 to 2024 which included participants aged under and up to 25\u00a0years who were either assessed as meeting criteria for both an ED and PTSD in the study, or were reported to have had a pre-existing diagnosis of ED and PTSD. Data from 24 studies were extracted and synthesised. PTSD prevalence among young people with EDs ranged from 0% to 46.4%, with higher rates observed in binging and purging-related EDs such as Bulimia Nervosa and binge-purge type anorexia. Risk factors associated with the comorbidity included trauma severity, binge-purging behaviours, and poor emotion regulation. No studies assessed treatment outcomes for this population. Overall, the current review highlights that, while co-occurring PTSD and EDs represents a relatively common psychiatric comorbidity in young people, the existing body of literature does not adequately explain the development of this comorbidity or how it impacts response to treatment. Future research is needed to clarify causal pathways, understand developmental trajectories of this comorbidity, and evaluate the impact of this psychiatric comorbidity on treatment outcomes.",

        "abstract": "This study aims to identify clinical and developmental factors associated with psychotropic medication exposure and subspecialty psychiatric service utilization among patients with genetic neurodevelopmental disorders (GNDDs).\nWe conducted a retrospective analysis of 316 patients from the Care and Research in Neurogenetics (CARING) Clinic at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). We assessed the association between neurodevelopmental and psychiatric diagnoses, behavioral histories, family history, and service utilization with two outcomes: (1) the number of psychotropic medication classes trialed before clinic intake and (2) whether the patient was evaluated by a CARING psychiatrist. Poisson and logistic regression models were used to evaluate associations while adjusting for demographic and clinical covariates.\nIndividuals with more severe behavioral disturbances had higher psychiatric service needs, while intellectual disability was associated with greater psychotropic medication exposure but not increased psychiatric consultation, possibly due to prior community-based care. The presence of a pathogenic/likely pathogenic genetic variant was not associated with either outcome, suggesting that genetic diagnosis alone does not predict psychiatric needs. Instead, behavioral comorbidities, not genetic status, were the primary drivers of psychotropic use and psychiatric referrals. A history of developmental delay was negatively associated with psychiatric consultation, and mediation analyses indicated that early intervention services partly explained this relationship. Additionally, patients receiving behavioral therapies had higher psychotropic exposure, reflecting greater clinical complexity and frequent use of multimodal treatment strategies.\nOur findings suggest that psychiatric needs in GNDDs are more closely tied to behavioral comorbidities than to genetic diagnosis status, reinforcing the importance of symptom-driven psychiatric evaluation. The observed relationship between early developmental interventions and psychiatric service utilization warrants further longitudinal investigation.

        "abstract": "Children with epilepsy are at increased risk for reduced health-related quality of life (HRQoL), due to the combined impact of seizures, comorbidities (somatic, psychiatric, neurologic, neurodevelopmental), social limitations. However, validated tools in different languages for HRQoL in pediatric epilepsies remain limited.\nTo explore HRQoL in children/adolescents with epilepsy, focusing on epilepsy-related factors, social difficulties, and overall well-being, after linguistic validation of the Italian Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory Epilepsy Module (PedsQL-EM).\nThe sample included 119 participants (aged 8-18-year-old). Caregivers completed the Italian PedsQL-EM and the Italian version of the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) Social Problems subscale. Hierarchical multiple regression was performed to identify predictors of HRQoL, and a mediation model tested the indirect effects on the Social Problems subscale of the CBCL.\nThe Italian PedsQL-EM showed good internal consistency (\u03c9\u00a0=\u00a00.72-.92). We found an high correlation between each domain of the PedsQL-EM, allowing to perform further analysis using a comprehensive total score. The total score strongly correlated with lower cognitive performances, neurological and psychiatric comorbidities, and was also significantly correlated with the subscale scores of the CBCL. HRQoL significantly mediated the relationship between clinical severity and social problems (indirect effect\u00a0=\u00a02.83; 95\u00a0% CI = 1.374-4.402).\nIn children with epilepsy, lower cognitive abilities and neurological/psychiatric comorbidities may affect social functioning through the mediation role of HRQoL. Utilizing PedsQL-EM as a screening tool can help identify these risks early, allowing for targeted interventions. Given the high psychiatric comorbidity in these patients, integrating behavioral health services into epilepsy care could improve comprehensive assessment and treatment, enhancing overall outcomes for affected children.",

        "abstract": "Auditory Brainstem Response (ABR) is an objective, non-invasive hearing test requiring the subject to remain still for accurate results. This poses challenges in children with neurodevelopmental disabilities. Traditionally, general anaesthesia (GA) was employed, but it carries risks, high costs, and long waiting times. Melatonin, with minimal side effects and no need for monitoring, offers a potential alternative. This study evaluates the feasibility and efficacy of melatonin-induced sleep as an alternative for GA in ABR testing.\nA retrospective review was conducted on 52 children with neurodevelopmental disabilities referred for ABR under melatonin-induced sleep at the Royal Hospital for Children, Glasgow, from July 2023 to November 2024. Pre-test sleep deprivation and a 9\u00a0mg dose of melatonin were used. Children with unsuccessful first tests were invited for a second attempt. If both attempts failed, GA was required.\nOf 47 attendees, 53\u00a0% achieved successful ABR testing on the first attempt, and 26.7\u00a0% at the second attempt. Cumulatively, 61.7\u00a0% did not require GA. No significant correlation was found between age, sex, or co-morbidities and success rates. Median GA ABR waiting times decreased by 25.8\u00a0%, and 26 children were removed from the GA waiting list. Cost analysis showed a 43.32\u00a0% saving per patient using melatonin-induced sleep compared to GA. Parent acceptability was high, irrespective of testing outcomes.\nMelatonin-induced sleep is a feasible, cost-effective alternative to GA for ABR testing. Despite the relatively low success rates, it reduces waiting times, lowers costs, and minimises the need for GA.",

Increased fidelity and availability of fetal imaging and increasing yields of advanced genetic testing help the fetal neurologist provide an assessment of potential neurodevelopmental outcomes when a suspected or confirmed fetal brain malformation is present. The postnatal care of infants with a previously diagnosed brain abnormality may include pediatricians in a general primary care setting. It is imperative that pediatricians have a basic understanding of common fetal neurologic conditions and comorbidities to provide the best care to new families facing these challenges.\nGrowing literature of fetal brain abnormalities has allowed for increasing prenatal neurologic diagnoses. The recent recognition of neonatal neurocritical care as a distinct subspecialty seeks to optimize the management and care of this patient population.\nThis review provides a broad overview of the evolution of fetal neurology as a distinct field within neurology and neonatal neurocritical care. This article highlights nuances of fetal consultations and reviews some of the more common fetal neurologic diagnoses and comorbidities. Finally, it provides a call to action for collaborative management in pediatric care.",

        "abstract": "Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a prevalent neurodevelopmental condition that persists into late adolescence and even adulthood. While a lot of research has addressed the issues of childhood ADHD, manifestation of the condition in adults, particularly females, remains largely obscure. The aim of the present narrative review is to address the sex-specific subtleties of ADHD in adolescent and adult female populations and critically analyze the various intricately complex facets of the associated comorbidities and outcomes, based upon data extracted from scholarly works indexed in online databases (eg, PubMed, Google Scholar, etc). We provide evidences refuting the presumption that ADHD primarily affects men, highlighting the complexity of clinical outcomes and comorbidities, and the consequent misdiagnosis of women as a possible reason. Comprehensive critical assessment of the multiple aspects of psycho-socio-behavioral, cognitive, and other clinical outcomes and comorbidities associated with ADHD in women indicated widespread dysfunctions and atypical characteristics. Furthermore, we also propose the probable utilities of art-based and other unconventional behavioral therapeutic regimens as alternatives and/or additives for the therapy of female ADHD cases to address case- and gender-specific needs and induce an overall improvement in their functioning. While this is not an exhaustive review of the literature, we hope that our points of discussion will generate further interest among scientists, clinicians, and caregivers to address the age and gender specificity of the condition to advance our perspectives of the condition and eventually establish novel therapeutic measures for the same.",

For instance, both ASD and Schizotypal PD may exhibit social withdrawal, while ASD and Borderline PD share impulsivity and identity disturbances-though with distinct etiologies (neurodevelopmental vs. trauma-related).\nClinicians must adopt a developmental perspective to disentangle ASD from PDs, integrating longitudinal history, neuropsychological testing, and multidisciplinary evaluations.

        "abstract": "Multimorbidities are a global health challenge. Accumulating evidence indicates that overlapping genetic architectures underlie comorbid complex human traits and disorders. This can be quantified for a pair of phenotypes using various techniques. Still, the pattern of genetic overlap between three distinct complex phenotypes, which is important for understanding multimorbidities, has not been possible to quantify.\nHere, we present and validate the novel trivariate MiXeR tool, which disentangles the pattern of genetic overlap between three complex phenotypes using summary statistics from genome-wide association studies. Our simulations show that trivariate MiXeR can reliably reconstruct different patterns of genetic overlap and estimate the proportions of genetic overlap between three phenotypes.\nWe found substantial genetic overlap between gastro-intestinal and brain diseases supporting a genetic basis of the gut-brain axis-the pattern consistent with pairwise analysis. However, the pattern of genetic overlap between three diverse cardiometabolic and renal health indicators and three immune-linked disorders revealed a much larger genomic component shared between all phenotypes than expected from separate pairwise analyses. This suggests the existence of core pathways underlying distinct but related chronic conditions.\nOverall, trivariate MiXeR offers a novel and efficient tool for investigating patterns of genetic overlap among three complex phenotypes. This contributes to a better understanding of genetic relationships between complex traits and disorders, potentially providing new insights into the mechanisms underlying common multimorbidities.

        "abstract": "Preterm birth remains a significant public health concern, with infants born before 32\u202fweeks of postmenstrual age at a higher risk for various comorbidities and neurodevelopmental impairments. Feeding challenges are particularly prevalent in preterm infants due to the immaturity of their physiological functions. The neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) environment can exacerbate these vulnerabilities through unregulated sensory stimulation and limited parental contact.\nA multiprofessional focus group was conducted to identify roles and responsibilities among NICU healthcare providers to develop and implement an individualized, integrated, interprofessional, and multidimensional care protocol. The aim is to promote neurobehavioral and early feeding skills in preterm newborns in the NICU. The protocol was grounded in the Newborn Individualized Developmental Care and Assessment Program (NIDCAP) and European Standards of Care for Newborn Health, with a focus on minimizing stress, enhancing parental empowerment, and utilizing a cue-based feeding approach.\nThe resulting \"STAmmi VICINO\" pathway consists of six flexible joint meetings at the infant's crib, involving parents and healthcare professionals, to provide comprehensive care strategies for the transition from enteral nutrition to autonomous sucking. Preliminary integration in the NICU practice demonstrated the feasibility and positive acceptance of the protocol among practitioners.\nOral feeding skills in preterm infants should not be assessed separately from neurobehavioral development. An interdisciplinary, family centered approach is critical for successful early intervention programs that aim to positively impact neurodevelopment.",

Other topics included faking and attention-seeking, school and childhood context, trauma and abuse, validity of self-diagnosis, medical research evidence, gender identity and sexuality, profanity, and sarcasm-laden commentary.\nThis scepticism does not mirror previously identified public doubts about the legitimacy of specific diagnoses and seems to more commonly focus on conditions that have seen a recent increase in diagnosis in young people.",

        "abstract": "Tourette syndrome (TS) and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) often co-occur and are linked to emotional and behavioral difficulties. However, their shared and distinct neural underpinnings, particularly in terms of functional connectivity, remain unclear. Here, we assessed how functional connectivity differs across TS and ADHD as well as its association with emotional and behavioral difficulties.\nResting-state electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded from 137 children with TS (n = 51), ADHD (n = 24), or TS + ADHD (n = 29) or from typically developing control subjects (n = 33). Functional connectivity was computed from source-reconstructed EEG data in five frequency bands (delta, theta, alpha, beta, and gamma). Behavioral and emotional problems were assessed with the Child Behavior Checklist.\nBoth TS and ADHD were independently associated with reduced functional connectivity across different brain regions, with no interaction effect. However, externalizing problems showed a TS by ADHD interaction across three frequency bands, such that distinct patterns of functional connectivity were associated with externalizing problems in children with TS + ADHD, relative to those with either TS or ADHD.\nAlthough TS and ADHD are associated with decreased functional connectivity in different networks, their effects appear additive rather than interactive at the neural level. However, interactions emerged when examining behavioral problems, suggesting that although TS and ADHD contribute independently to brain connectivity disruptions, their combined impact may uniquely influence emotional and behavioral functioning. This fact highlights the need to consider both shared and disorder-specific mechanisms when studying TS and ADHD.",

        "abstract": "Children with heart conditions, particularly CHDs, may experience adverse neurodevelopmental and psychosocial outcomes. Our study aimed to: (1) compare national prevalence of mental, behavioural, and developmental disorders among children by heart condition status and (2) identify associated characteristics among children with heart conditions.\nNationally representative data from the National Survey of Children's Health (2016-2021) on U.S. children aged 6-17 years without Down syndrome were analysed. Caregivers reported whether a healthcare provider told them their child has ever had a heart condition or currently has depression, anxiety, ADHD, behavioural, or conduct problems, Tourette syndrome, autism spectrum disorder, developmental delay, intellectual disability, learning disability, or a speech or other language disorder. Logistic regression analysis compared disorder prevalence by heart condition status and, among children with heart conditions, assessed whether disorders were associated with demographic and contextual characteristics.\nAmong 3,440 children with heart conditions, 42% had an examined disorder, compared to 23% of 133,280 children without heart conditions (adjusted prevalence ratio = 1.8; 95% confidence interval: 1.7, 2.0). Each disorder was more prevalent among children with versus without heart conditions (adjusted prevalence ratio range: 1.9 to 5.1), with anxiety (22.1%), ADHD (20.4%), and learning disabilities (19.6%) most common. Among children with heart conditions, disorders were consistently associated with an increased number of adverse childhood experiences.\nThese findings support clinical guidelines recommending neurodevelopmental and mental health screening and interventions for children with heart conditions and can be used as a national baseline to gauge progress of guideline implementation.",

        "abstract": "The expansion of telehealth during the COVID-19 pandemic transformed behavioral health care delivery, including for individuals with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and Tourette syndrome (TS), conditions that require ongoing treatment and monitoring. We explored the implications of telehealth on the quality of care for Medicaid beneficiaries with ADHD and TS, highlighting the benefits, challenges, and policy considerations. Telehealth has increased access to behavioral health services, including for ADHD and TS, by reducing geographic and financial barriers to care. The expanded use of telehealth has allowed patients to more easily interact with health care providers, and it particularly benefits those with limited access to specialized care. However, challenges remain, such as concerns about stimulant misuse in online ADHD treatments and the limited privacy offered in home telehealth settings. Furthermore, disparities in broadband access may exacerbate existing inequalities in care. Despite telehealth's potential to increase access to specialized care, the quality of telehealth provided is not guaranteed. Current quality measures for Medicaid telehealth services, especially for ADHD and TS, are insufficient. While some Medicaid programs have integrated telehealth into quality reporting, a need exists for more tailored measures that assess the unique needs of people with ADHD and TS. We recommend the development of quality measures for ADHD and TS, performance improvement projects for these conditions, better alignment of Medicaid managed care oversight, and research into the long-term outcomes of telehealth for care of people with ADHD and TS. Such efforts would support continued Medicaid telehealth expansion while ensuring high-quality care.",

        "abstract": "Here, we present the first genome-wide association study of obsessive-compulsive symptoms in a sample of clinically diagnosed pediatric participants and healthy controls. Using a psychiatric questionnaire score as a quantitative trait we conducted a large-scale genetic analysis and ran multiple post-association analyses to investigate the mediating role of obsessive-compulsive symptoms in six comorbid neuropsychiatric disorders. Although no SNPs reached genome-wide significance, we identified suggestive associations on chromosomes 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 17, 19, and 22. Notable genes mapped to these regions were highlighted, though none met the threshold for multiple testing correction. Further, polygenic risk scoring and Mendelian randomization analyses explored the potential mediating role and genetic disposition of obsessive-compulsive symptoms in obsessive-compulsive disorder, anxiety, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, depression, autism spectrum disorders and/or Tourette syndrome. We found that genetic predisposition for OCS accounts for approximately 2% in individuals with one or more of these six disorders, with a particularly strong mediation effect observed for anxiety disorders. This study underscores the value of examining genetic risk across the symptom spectrum of mental illnesses, rather than relying solely on binary diagnostic categories.",

Botulinum neurotoxin injections were tailored to individual symptomatology. Overall, 64% of patients reported improvement in tic severity, 36% noted no change, and 6% worsened. Response did not differ significantly by tic complexity, phenomenology (clonic vs dystonic), or presence of a premonitory urge. Comorbidities such as attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), obsessive-compulsive disorder, autism, and intellectual disability were not predictive of outcomes. These findings support botulinum neurotoxin as a safe and potentially effective treatment for pediatric motor tics, including complex and malignant presentations.",

Data collected included demographics, tic characteristics (using the Yale Global Tic Severity Scale), psychiatric comorbidities, and medication use. Statistical analyses were performed to compare data between sexes.\nThe sex ratio was 1.8 males to 1 female. The most common motor tics were simple (eye blinking, simple head movements), and the most common phonic tic was throat clearing. There were no significant sex differences in tic phenomenology or severity. Generalized anxiety disorder (49.5%) and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) (35.8%) were the most common comorbidities. A lower proportion of women were diagnosed with ADHD, while a higher proportion were diagnosed with obsessive compulsive disorder.\nThe male predominance of tic disorders is less marked in adulthood compared to childhood. Tic phenomenology and severity do not significantly differ between sexes. These findings provide valuable insights into the clinical presentation of tic disorders in adults. Future research will explore severity of comorbid mental health conditions, how these influence tic severity, treatment outcomes and quality of life.",

MCAS is a common, yet rarely diagnosed, inflammatory, and immunologic disease characterized by mast cell dysregulation.\nQuestionnaires from 553 MCAS and 558 control subjects determined the prevalence and odds ratio of neurologic disorders (fatigue, cognitive dysfunction, fainting/near fainting, migraine-like headaches, muscle pain/tenderness/weakness, pain/numbness/tingling in extremities, restless legs syndrome, seizure-like activity, insomnia, sleep attacks, tinnitus, acoustic startle, Tourette's syndrome, resting tremor, and light/sun/pain/odors/scents/noise hypersensitivity) and psychiatric disorders (anxiety, agoraphobia, panic attacks, depression, bipolar depression, mania/hypomania, psychosis/schizophrenia, hallucinations, obsessive compulsive disorder, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, anger management problems, post-traumatic stress disorder, suicidal thoughts, and eating disorders).\nAmong 19 neurologic disorders, female MCAS patients reported higher rates in all but 1 disorder and male MCAS patients reported higher rates in all but 2 disorders. Among 14 psychiatric disorders, female MCAS patients reported higher rates in all and male MCAS patients reported higher rates in 8 disorders. Many of the disorders with increased prevalences were statistically greater compared to corresponding controls.In self-reported ratings for effects on health status (0\u00a0=\u00a0no benefit, 10\u00a0=\u00a0maximum benefit), mean (SD) response was 6.3 (2.5) for antihistamines, 5.6 (3.2) for low-dose naltrexone, and 5.6 (3.1) for benzodiazepines.\nMCAS subjects have significantly elevated odds ratios for many neuropsychiatric disorders and may see improvement of symptoms using MCAS-targeted therapies, suggesting that mast cell dysregulation affects the brain and peripheral nervous systems and contributes to neuropsychiatric symptoms. Certain mast cell mediators, specific genetic predisposition, and life experiences could determine which disorder is apt to develop or worsen.",

Sociodemographic data were collected, and participants were screened for other psychiatric conditions. All met DSM-5 criteria for OCD, with severity assessed using the Florida Obsessive-Compulsive Inventory and Y-BOCS. Statistical significance was set at p \u2264 0.0007, adjusted for multiple comparisons.\nThe OCD+pHD group had significantly lower educational attainment, was more likely to live alone or in supervised living, and less likely to be married. This group also had more severe OCD and poorer insight. All types of obsessions and compulsions were more frequent in the OCD+pHD group, except for obsessions related to harming others. Additionally, the OCD+pHD group had higher rates of major depressive disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, body dysmorphic disorder, trichotillomania and previous diagnosis and/or symptoms of attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder. No significant difference was found for substance use and Tic/Tourette disorders.\nSignificant clinical differences were observed between the groups, highlighting the need for further research to improve diagnosis, conceptualization, awareness, and support for individuals with hoarding disorder in the context of OCD.",

However, common patterns of co-occurring neuropsychiatric symptoms, and their potential impact on the clinical manifestation of hoarding, including functional impairment, are not well-established.\nLatent class analysis (LCA) was used to identify and characterize distinct neuropsychiatric symptom subgroups among 7606 adult internet-based research participants who reported experiencing social impairment due to household clutter. An additional 1129 participants who screened negative but had evidence of hoarding on additional assessment (\"false negative\") were identified and compared to the LCA-identified classes. Demographic and clinical characteristics associated with class membership were assessed.\nThe best fitting model yielded five subgroups, including three subgroups characterizing individuals with hoarding symptoms: \"hoarding only\" (12.1 %), hoarding with depressive symptoms (\"depressed + hoarding\"; 11.8 %), and hoarding with depressive symptoms, inattention, and subjective memory decline (\"multisymptomatic\"; 14.6 %). These subgroups fell along a continuum of increasing neuropsychiatric burden, with individuals in the \"multisymptomatic\" class experiencing the greatest deficits to general functional ability and cognitive functioning, as well as elevated rates of comorbid neuropsychiatric diagnoses. The \"false negative\" group was similar to the \"hoarding only\" class, although comprised of a significantly higher proportion of male participants and married individuals.\nNeuropsychiatric symptom patterns among individuals with hoarding are heterogenous in nature and uniquely associated with clinical features and functional outcomes.

        "abstract": "BackgroundUnderstanding inequalities in mental health care is vital for the development of more equitable services. This study investigates inequalities in out-of-area admissions to general adolescent units, a controversial but necessary part of Child and Adolescent Mental Health care in England.MethodsAnonymised data on 279 out-of-area (at-distance or out-of-region) admissions to general adolescent units in England between February 2021-2022 were analysed for an association between demographics (age, sex, ethnicity) or clinical characteristics (diagnosis and risks) and admission characteristics (7+ day wait for a bed, distance from home, admission out-of-region, compulsory admission and length of stay >6\u00a0months).ResultsNo association was found between demographic characteristics and admission characteristics. Personality disorder was the only diagnosis associated with admission greater distance from home. Young people with personality disorder or neurodevelopmental disorder were more likely to be admitted compulsorily (OR = 8.89 and OR = 1.93 respectively). Those with suicide risk were more likely to be admitted non-compulsorily (OR = 2.06) but more likely to be admitted out-of-region (OR = 2.25).DiscussionWithin these data, the clinical presentation of the young person influenced their out-of-area admission characteristics. Young people with a diagnosis of personality disorder may be particularly likely to experience more negative aspects of out-of-area admission.\nDue to the number and uneven spread of specialist mental health beds throughout the country, young people may be admitted far-away from where they live (more than 50 miles from their home address or out of their local region). Previous research has shown inequalities in the care received by young people based on their demographics and diagnoses. This study looks at whether there is evidence of this unequal treatment based on demographics, diagnoses, and risks within a sample of young people admitted far-away from home. Statistical tests were used to look for whether there was evidence that the demographics (age, sex and ethnicity) or presentation (diagnoses or risks) of a young person were associated with negative aspects of an admission (having to wait for a week or more for a bed, longer distance from home, being admitted out-of-region, spending more than 6\u00a0months in hospital and having to be admitted against their will). The researchers found no links between demographics and negative aspects of the admission in this data. However, they found that young people with a diagnosis of a personality disorder were sent on average further away than those who did not have this diagnosis, they were also more likely to be admitted against their will. Young people with a neurodevelopmental disorder (autism spectrum disorder, attention-deficit hyperactive disorder or Tourette\u2019s syndrome) were also more likely to be admitted against their will. Young people judged to be at high risk of suicide were more likely to be sent out-of-region and less likely to be admitted against their will. These findings do not show evidence of unequal treatment based upon demographics but potential inequalities due to diagnosis and risks. The reason for these differences may represent stigma against young people with certain diagnoses such as personality disorder.",

        "abstract": "Antipsychotic treatments require physical health monitoring (PHM), especially among children and young people (CYP).\nFor CYP aged 5-17, to investigate recorded indications for antipsychotics prescribing and first-treatment durations, and, for psychosis, bipolar disorder, autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and Tourette's syndrome, recorded levels of PHM for CYP with antipsychotics prescriptions and those without.\nAll CYP registered with QResearch English general practices between 2006 and 2021 were considered. To quantify PHM, 2158 CYP with antipsychotics prescriptions and 22 151 CYP with a condition but no prescriptions were followed for 2 years.\n47% (2363) of CYP with antipsychotics prescriptions had a recorded mental health condition of interest (of which 62% were ASD). 19% (921) had no relevant indication. For patients with ASD and Tourette syndrome, top quartiles for initial exposure to antipsychotics were >10 months. Recorded PHM was generally low, with over 50% of CYP showing no blood test during the 2-year follow-up.\nCoverage of best practice is uneven across the condition-related national CYP guidelines, and this requires improvement. However, we suspect some apparently poor adherence to best practice also derives from treatment complexities and associated data flows leading to gaps in the encoded general practice data. To audit more exactly clinical practice against guidelines, we propose qualitative studies, targeted to cover the full range of local circumstances, nationally.\nGeneral practices should be encouraged to prioritise encoding of all treatment data. Development of one central gold-standard set of recommendations for antipsychotics use could encourage better adherence levels across conditions.",

        "doi": "10.3390/pharmaceutics17060707",
        "abstract": "The intestine is an important segment of the gastrointestinal tract, which is involved in complex processes that maintain the body's normal homeostasis. It hosts a vast, diverse, and dynamic microbial community called the gut microbiota, which develops from birth. It has been observed that the gut microbiota is involved in essential physiological processes, including the development of the central nervous system via the gut microbiota-brain axis. An alteration of the gut microbiota can lead to serious health problems, including defective neurodevelopment. Thus, this paper aims to highlight the most recent advances in studies that focus on the link between the gut microbiota and the evolution of neurodevelopmental diseases in children. Currently, studies show that the use of drugs that stimulate and restore the gut microbiota (e.g., probiotics and prebiotics) have the potential to alleviate some of the symptoms associated with conditions such as Autism Spectrum Disorder, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, Tic Disorder, Tourette Syndrome, epilepsy, and Down Syndrome. In addition, due to the challenges associated with drug administration in children, as well as the widespread shortage of medications intended for pediatric use, researchers are working on the development of new delivery systems. Liposome-based systems or solid lipid nanoparticles have been safely used for drug delivery in various pediatric conditions, which may also indicate their potential for use in the administration of microbiota-modulating therapies.",

        "abstract": "Neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs), including attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and Tourette's syndrome (TS), impair brain development and function, primarily affecting cognition, behavior, and social skills in children. Epilepsy, characterized by recurrent seizures due to neuronal hyperexcitability, shares pathological mechanisms with NDDs, such as neuroinflammation, synaptic dysfunction, and oxidative stress. Omega-3 fatty acids-primarily docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA)-exert neuroprotective and neuromodulatory effects in these conditions through multifaceted mechanisms. Omega-3 fatty acids play a role in activating the Nrf2/ARE pathway, protecting neurons from oxidative damage, regulating the gut-brain axis, and regulating the balance of microflora. Although Omega-3 fatty acids have a natural safety advantage in improving NDDs and epilepsy symptoms, the bioavailability is limited by the source, formulation form, and dietary environment. Current studies point out that monotherapy has a limited effect and requires a combination of vitamin D, probiotics, or drugs, as well as the development of innovative functional foods to improve intake efficiency. This review summarizes the multi-pathway roles of Omega-3 fatty acids in NDDs and epilepsy, emphasizing the potential as a core component of integrated treatment strategies. Future studies should prioritize precision nutrition approaches and functional food development to optimize patient outcomes in neuropsychiatric care.",

        "abstract": "There has been remarkable progress in recent years in understanding the genetic underpinnings of child psychiatric disorders. Concurrently, genetic testing is becoming increasingly available in the clinic. However, many clinicians report a lack of familiarity with genetics and how genetic testing might inform a clinical evaluation. This review aims to introduce clinicians to cutting-edge research in child psychiatric genetics and discuss the emerging role of genetic tests in clinical practice.\nThis review highlights major findings presented at the Research Institute of the 69th American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry Annual Meeting.\nAn overview of critical genetic concepts for clinicians is provided along with a discussion of recent advances in child psychiatric genetics, focusing on autism spectrum disorder, where whole exome sequencing has led to the identification of approximately 250 high-confidence risk genes. The review describes how similar approaches to gene discovery are beginning to shed light on the genetic architecture of early-onset psychosis, Tourette's disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and other disorders. In addition, the practical limitations of pharmacogenetic testing, ethical considerations, and barriers to clinical genetic testing are discussed. Finally, the promise of genetic research for advancing understanding of the pathophysiology of these disorders is illustrated.\nThis review aims to improve clinicians' knowledge of how genetic findings might inform clinical evaluation and management of child psychiatric disorders and the potential for groundbreaking research in the field to shape the development of new treatments.\nOne or more of the authors of this paper self-identifies as a member of one or more historically underrepresented racial and/or ethnic groups in science. We actively worked to promote sex and gender balance in our author group.\nThis review highlights essential genetic concepts and past decade progress in gene discovery, with a particular focus on autism spectrum disorders. The practical applications of genetic testing for clinicians are also explored, including the limitations of pharmacogenetic testing, as well as ethical considerations and barriers to implementing clinical genetic testing.

        "abstract": "Neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs), such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD), attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), and Tourette syndrome are highly prevalent in childhood and are influenced by both genetic and environmental factors. The maternal immune activation (MIA) hypothesis suggests that inflammation during pregnancy can increase the risk of NDDs in offspring. However, current practice focuses mainly on capturing family history of neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders. Beyond this, capturing detailed early life environmental data in clinical settings remains challenging. To address this, we developed NDD-ECHO (Neurodevelopmental Disorders-Environmental and Clinical History Online), a standardised digital assessment tool designed to systematically collect maternal and child environmental histories, alongside neurodevelopmental symptom profiles. NDD-ECHO is designed to collaboratively collect information from caregivers with clinician input, covering family medical history, maternal pregnancy history and environmental exposures, child's environmental exposures (including infection) and child's diagnosis, clinical course, and function. The survey, built on the REDCap platform, was piloted in a cohort of 161 children with complex NDDs referred to a tertiary neurodevelopmental clinic. Our results demonstrate that nearly 80\u00a0% of children experienced loss of developmental skills, and many had symptom exacerbations triggered by infections or stress, supporting the role of environmental factors in NDD symptomatology. NDD-ECHO, available for free download via the REDCap Shared Library, has clinical and research applications, enabling standardised identification of environmental triggers and exploration of gene-environment interactions. This tool advances research by improving data collection on environmental risk factors and enhances personalised care for children with NDDs. Limitations include reliance on retrospective caregiver reports and the pilot cohort's specialised clinical setting, which may limit generalisability.",

        "abstract": "The brain's process of creating\u00a0neural networks that affect functionality or performance is referred to as neurodevelopment. A person's capacity to learn and remember, pay attention, regulate their emotions, socialize, exercise and self-control are just a few of the cognitive and motor abilities that can be affected by abnormal brain development. Numerous neurodevelopmental diseases have been functionally related to abnormalities in innate immune signaling networks. Innate immunity is in charge of the defense of humans against pathogens and tissue damage by triggering inflammation, mainly through sensing pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). Some of these inflammatory processes have been shown to be mediated by large multiprotein complexes called inflammasomes which are present in cytosol and play important roles in the immune system. Due to its role in defense against infectious agents, bacteria, viruses, and fungi, NLRP3 is almost the most studied and well-known member of inflammasomes. The involvement of NLRP3 in inflammatory illnesses is evident due to the wide range of triggers and its intricate signaling pathways. In disorders with neurodevelopmental underpinnings, such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), schizophrenia (SCZ), obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), bipolar disorder (BD), Tourette syndrome (TS), etc., neuroinflammation plays a significant role in their pathophysiology. For these reasons, we reviewed the roles of NLRP3 in various neurodevelopmental disorders below.",

        "abstract": "NRXN1 microdeletions are associated with an increased genetic risk for various neuropsychiatric disorders, with diverse breakpoints complicating research, diagnosis, and treatment. This study aims to investigate the deletion rate and penetrance of NRXN1 microdeletions across different clinical phenotypes through meta-analysis while exploring their relationship with epilepsy and summarizing the characteristics of NRXN1 biallelic variations.\nFor meta-analysis, a systematic review of published studies was conducted to calculate NRXN1 microdeletion rates and penetrance across different disorders, with comparisons to control groups. For systematic review, data from 401 cases across 57 studies were analyzed to compare microdeletion characteristics in patients with and without epilepsy, alongside a review of NRXN1 biallelic variation clinical features.\nNRXN1 microdeletion carriers had a 3.20-fold higher disease risk compared to noncarriers. The deletion rate was elevated in patients with autism, schizophrenia, and Tourette syndrome relative to controls. Additionally, NRXN1 microdeletions were more prevalent in epilepsy patients with comorbidities than in those with epilepsy alone. Among epilepsy patients, 81.3% had comorbidities. Deletions involving exons 1-6 were more frequent in patients with epilepsy, of whom 71.42% were diagnosed with genetic generalized epilepsy (GGE). Among those with NRXN1 biallelic variations, 53.84% had epilepsy, and all experienced generalized seizures.\nUnderstanding genotype-phenotype associations in NRXN1 microdeletion-related diseases is critical for early diagnosis and management. Our study shows that NRXN1 microdeletions have been associated with various neuropsychiatric disorders and exhibit incomplete penetrance. In epilepsy, patients with NRXN1 microdeletions are associated with mental comorbidities and generalized seizure types, particularly involving exon 1-6 deletions, and are common in patients with GGE.",

Although ARZ offers significant therapeutic benefits, its poor solubility in water requires the development of delivery systems aimed at improving the solubility and bioavailability of the drug. In this work, cryogels based on two natural products-agar and \u03b2-cyclodextrin (CD)-were developed and evaluated as a drug delivery system for ARZ. The cryogels were prepared by cryogenic treatment of aqueous solutions of agar and the \u03b2-CD/ARZ complex, followed by thawing. The main characteristics of the material, including gel fraction yield, swelling degree, pore volume, elastic properties, and morphology were studied in detail. The release of ARZ from composite cryogels was assessed in two media resembling the pH in stomach and intestine. The system exhibited a pH-dependent release of ARZ, with a slower rate in acidic media (pH 1.2) than in the neutral phosphate buffer (pH 6.8). Under in vitro conditions, the amount of released ARZ over 48 h reached 33%.",

        "abstract": "Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a psychiatric disease with a prevalence of 2%-3%. Despite the effectiveness of antidepressants, such as serotonin reuptake inhibitors, for treating OCD, its pathogenesis remains unclear. Recent research has implicated immunological mechanisms, particularly in OCD patients with comorbid neurodevelopmental disorders (NDD), such as autism spectrum disorder, attention deficit/hyperactive disorder, and Tourette's disorder. To examine these mechanisms, we investigated immunological factors involved in OCD patients with any NDD comorbidity (OCD\u00a0+\u00a0NDD group), compared with those without comorbid NDD (OCD group).\nTwenty-eight OCD patients treated at Hyogo Medical University Hospital were recruited for this study. Of them, 14 patients with NDD comorbidity (OCD\u00a0+\u00a0NDD) were compared with 14 patients without comorbid NDD (OCD). RNA was extracted from blood samples and analyzed using RNA sequencing and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA). Plasma levels of IL11 and IL17A were measured with ELISA.\nRNA sequencing identified 716 significantly differentially expressed genes, with 47 related to immune functions, in the OCD\u00a0+\u00a0NDD group compared with the OCD group. IL11 and IL17A were central, with IL11 linked to neutrophil production and IL17A to T cell migration and cytokine secretion. Pathway analysis indicated complex interactions among these genes.\nThis study highlights significant immunological changes in OCD patients with any NDD. Decreased anti-inflammatory IL11 and increased proinflammatory IL17A suggest a shift towards inflammation, which may contribute to neurodevelopmental issues.\nImmunological dysregulation in OCD with comorbid NDD may offer potential therapeutic targets. Immune gene interactions should be further investigated in effort to improve treatment strategies for treatment-refractory OCD patients, especially those with neurodevelopmental comorbidities.",

Sensory phenomena (SP) are uncomfortable feelings, including bodily sensations, sense of inner tension, \"just-right\" perceptions, feelings of incompleteness, or \"urge-only\" phenomena, which have been described to precede, trigger, or accompany RRB. In such clinical contexts RRB and SP may be considered common variables that affect multiple aspects of daily functioning and are treatment targets.\nThis study aims to further understand RRB and SP phenomenology in children and adolescents diagnosed with OCD, TS or ASD and identify whether specific RRB or SP can distinguish these groups.\nWe assessed RRB and SP in participants aged between 6 and 17 with a main diagnosis of OCD (n\u2009=\u200923), TS (n\u2009=\u200919), or ASD (n\u2009=\u200921) with the Repetitive Behavior Scale-Revised (RBS-R) and The University of Sao Paulo-Sensory Phenomena Scale (USP-SPS).\nThe RBS-R mean was 17.3\u2009\u00b1\u200914.9 with no group differences for total RBS-R symptom severity, except for the routine subscale (OCD\u2009>\u2009ASD, p\u2009=\u20090.03). Ninety percent of participants showed at least one type of SP on the USP-SPS with a mean total severity of 5.3\u2009\u00b1\u20093.8, with no statistical differences between groups. The most frequent SP subtype was physical sensations (68.4%).\nRRB and SP are transdiagnostic features\u00a0in neurodevelopmental disorders\u00a0and the RBS-R and the USP-SPS might be useful in their assessment and treatment plan.",

Emerging evidence highlights the role of epigenetic mechanisms, particularly DNA methylation, histone modification, and non-coding RNAs, in mediating how early-life exposures shape brain development. This review synthesizes findings from 48 recent studies, including human cohorts and animal models, linking prenatal stress, maternal nutrition, endocrine disruptors, and air pollution to epigenetic alterations that disrupt neurogenesis, synaptic plasticity, and neural differentiation. These mechanisms offer insight into clinical phenomena and open potential for early screening and epigenetic interventions in pediatric neurology. The main finding reveals that early environmental exposures can leave lasting epigenetic marks that significantly influence neurodevelopment and contribute to pediatric neurological disorders.",

Given high rates of co-occurrence between autism and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), it is valuable to identify shared risk factors for poor mental health. The present study investigated mental health trajectories among autistic youth and youth with ADHD from Spring 2020-Spring 2023 and explored how parent-reported youth social skills predicted these trajectories. Participants included 272 youth (autism\u2009=\u2009143, ADHD\u2009=\u2009129) aged 8-18. Social skills were assessed in Spring 2020. Youth- and parent-reported youth anxiety and depressive symptoms were assessed at six timepoints. Results from growth mixture modelling suggest there were different mental health trajectories during the pandemic. Trajectories of increasing, decreasing, and stable scores emerged for youth- and parent-reported youth anxiety, and parent-reported youth depression. For youth-reported depression scores, only an elevated-stable trajectory emerged. Autistic youth with better social skills were more likely to have high and increasing, and medium and stable parent-reported youth anxiety over the pandemic. Additionally, autistic youth with better social skills had lower youth-reported depression scores at the start of the pandemic. For both autistic youth and youth with ADHD, higher levels of social skills were associated with a greater probability of having low and stable parent-reported youth depression scores over the pandemic. Findings provide insight into the mental health trajectories among neurodiverse youth for the entire duration of the pandemic. Results suggest that social skills may be a valuable intervention target, especially for autistic youth.",

However, psychophysical testing of this has primarily focused on ASD with no equivalent research on ADHD. The relationship between ADHD, ASD and sensory processing may also be influenced by anxiety. This study investigates whether orientation discrimination performance is differentially related to ADHD and ASD \nWe measure visual orientation discrimination thresholds using a method of constant stimuli in a two-alternative forced choice paradigm with an adaptive, randomly interleaved procedure and a one up three down design. The task results are compared to reported trait expressions of ADHD, ASD and anxiety via correlational analysis. Following on this we conduct a mediation analysis to assess the possible mediating role of anxiety.\nThe ADHD and ASD trait expressions were associated with similar sensory processing abnormalities. The panic and generalized anxiety traits were only specifically associated with the ADHD-Hyperactive type and respective sensory thresholds. Such effects were not observed for any ASD traits.\nThese findings suggest that while both ADHD and ASD traits are linked to reduced orientation sensitivity, only ADHD traits-particularly hyperactivity-show specific associations mediated by anxiety. This points to distinct underlying mechanisms in the sensory processing profiles of ADHD and ASD, with anxiety playing a more prominent role in ADHD-related impairments.",

        "abstract": "Autism and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are among the most common neurodivergent neurotypes worldwide. Epidemiological evidence shows that sleep and circadian disturbances, such as difficulty initiating and maintaining sleep, and delayed sleep-wake phase, are highly prevalent in autistic children, children with ADHD, and those with both neurotypes. Despite scientific advancements, a comprehensive framework integrating sleep and circadian mechanisms with targeted interventions for autism and ADHD remains underdeveloped. In this Review we examine sleep and circadian rhythm differences in autistic children and adolescents, and in those with ADHD or both neurotypes, focusing on the underlying biological mechanisms. We discuss recent advances in the genetic and molecular links between sleep, circadian rhythms, and neuroplasticity, alongside the influence of these systems on physiology and therapeutic strategies. Both pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions are considered, with an emphasis on the need for an integrated support model that accounts for the dynamic interplay between sleep and circadian rhythms in these populations. We identify key gaps in the current evidence base, particularly in relation to non-pharmacological interventions, and outline future research directions. Although most randomised controlled trials in children and adolescents have focused on behavioural sleep interventions, we also discuss emerging findings from trials using alternative approaches, such as targeted light therapy in adults, with implications for paediatric populations. Finally, we emphasise the importance of incorporating the perspectives of autistic children and adolescents and those with ADHD, as well as their parents and caregivers, into research designs.",

CMAMMA is generally considered a benign disorder, with recent descriptions of potential neuropsychiatric symptoms in children (Levtova et al., 2019).

His epilepsy consisted of tonic, atonic, and generalized tonic-clonic seizures with electroclinical features consistent with LGS. The patient had comorbid autism, aggression, and intellectual disability with a history of developmental regression. Genetic testing confirmed pathogenic biallelic ACSF3 variants, and urine organic acid testing showed elevated levels of MA and MMA in urine.\nThis case suggests that CMAMMA can lead to severe epilepsy and a neuropsychiatric phenotype, expanding the clinical spectrum of the disorder.",

        "abstract": "Mental disorders among adolescents and young adults (ages 10-24) are a significant public health challenge, contributing to long-term morbidity and substantial societal impact. This study analyzes the prevalence, incidence, and years lived with disability (YLDs) of mental disorders in this age group from 1990-2021, with particular attention to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic during 2019-2021. Using data from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2021, we estimated the prevalence, incidence, and YLDs, along with age-standardized rates (ASR) and 95% uncertainty intervals (95% UIs) for 2021, stratified by sex and age group. Joinpoint regression was employed to calculate annual percentage change (APC) and average annual percentage change (AAPC), along with their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs). In 2021, the global prevalence of mental disorders among adolescents and young adults was 278.98 million (95% UI: 248.61-312.81), with an ASR of 14,764.94 (95% UI: 2804.87-16,908.09). From 2019-2021, there were significant increases in the prevalence, incidence, and YLDs of mental disorders, especially for depressive and anxiety disorders. High-income regions, including North America, Western Europe, and the Asia Pacific, experienced the highest burdens. Globally, the prevalence of mental disorders was higher in males than females among adolescents aged 10-14, but higher in females among those aged 15-24. Joinpoint regression analysis from 1990-2021 revealed an increased burden in depressive disorders, anxiety disorders, bipolar disorder, eating disorders, autism spectrum disorder, conduct disorder, and idiopathic developmental intellectual disability, while decreases were observed in schizophrenia, ADHD, and other mental disorders. This study highlights the significant impact of COVID-19 on the mental health of adolescents and young adults, revealing disparities by region, age, sex, time period, and cohort. It underscores the need for targeted interventions to address the rising mental health burden in this group.",

Resilience is a topic of interest among groups who commonly experience adversity.

This study is part of a larger project investigating the bio-psycho-social factors contributing to resilience in neurodivergence using the World Health Organization's International Classification of Functioning (ICF). Interviews and focus groups were conducted with 69 neurodivergent individuals and/or their loved ones to explore the factors they believe influence risk and resilience for positive life outcomes and well-being. A deductive qualitative content analysis was employed to extract meaningful concepts from the interviews, which we then quantified by linking concepts to the ICF. A range of bio-psycho-social factors contributing to risk and resilience were identified, particularly in the ICF's activity, participation, and environmental domains. Key factors included the immediate family, friends, and community members, as well as recreation and leisure, higher-level cognitive functions, and empowerment. Findings, while preliminary, highlight the need to look beyond individual factors alone, emphasizing the variable and context-dependent nature of resilience in neurodivergence.",

        "abstract": "Atypical social attention is a feature of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), yet this has not yet been studied during toy-free naturalistic parent-infant interactions in infants at elevated likelihood of developing ADHD (EL-ADHD). We coded mutual gaze from caregiver-infant free-play videos recorded at 4-7\u00a0months in infants with typical likelihood (TL; n\u00a0=\u00a037), elevated likelihood of ASD (EL-ASD; n\u00a0=\u00a055), ADHD (EL-ADHD; n\u00a0=\u00a013) or both (EL-ASD\u00a0+\u00a0ADHD; n\u00a0=\u00a013). Face-orienting responses were measured using an eye tracking face pop-out task at 8-12\u00a0months, and ASD research diagnosis was established at 36\u00a0months. Results showed that EL groups engaged in more mutual gaze than TL peers, revealing a broad alteration in dyadic attention across neurodevelopmental likelihood. However, mutual-gaze duration did not differentiate infants who were later given an ASD diagnosis at age 3\u00a0years (n\u00a0=\u00a014). Furthermore, only in the EL-ASD group greater early mutual gaze predicted reduced subsequent orienting to faces. This association was mainly driven by those diagnosed with ASD at age 3, potentially indicating an ASD-specific developmental pathway. These findings highlight the value of naturalistic paradigms for probing early social attention and the need for larger, jointly analysed EL-ASD and EL-ADHD cohorts to refine neurodevelopmental models of typical and atypical infant social attention.",

This gene controls the production of the enzyme, histone methyltransferase 1, which has widespread impacts on the body's ability to function. There are numerous physiologic impacts of the genetic abnormalities associated with Kleefstra syndrome, including psychiatric and behavioral comorbidities. One of these comorbidities is Catatonia. Catatonia is a neuropsychiatric syndrome that is associated with psychomotor disturbances, with individuals either appearing to be hypokinetic or, less commonly, hyperkinetic. It is defined by a compilation of symptoms that range from changes in communication, movements, and behaviors. Though case reports in the literature are nonexistent, Catatonia is known to be associated with Kleefstra syndrome. Furthermore, the successful treatment of Catatonia associated with Kleefstra has not yet been reported. This case describes a 17-year-old male with a history of Kleefstra syndrome and Catatonia who was successfully treated with scheduled Lorazepam. Discussion of such a case in the literature is important to help other providers appropriately diagnose and treat this often overlooked psychiatric condition in patients with complex genetic syndromes.",

        "abstract": "The Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS) is an established tool for screening autism. An increasing number of studies have utilized the SRS in the general population as an outcome measure to gain insight into the etiology of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). However, SRS scores have not been well characterized in large pediatric cohorts, particularly in relation to their demographic, genetic, neuroimaging, and comorbidity profiles, or how these patterns compare to those observed in clinically diagnosed ASD. This study included 9788 non-ASD children and 182 autistic children aged 9-11 years from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study. Generalized linear mixed-effect models were applied to evaluate the associations of short social responsiveness scale (SSRS) with a spectrum of demographic, genetic, neuroimaging, and behavioral characteristics. We estimated the heritability of SSRS using a subsample of twin and sibling data. Our finding revealed that children with higher SSRS exhibited a higher male-to-female ratio. SSRS had a high heritability of 0.52 (95% CI, 0.45-0.63), and higher SSRS scores were correlated with increased polygenic risk for ASD (P\u2009<\u20090.001). Neuroimaging analyses identified both overlapping and unique neurobiological underpinnings, with sex-specific variations in structural and functional connectivity similar to those observed in ASD. Higher SSRS scores were linked to lower fluid intelligence, more behavioral problems, more sleep problems, and more psychotic-like symptoms. These findings highlight both the overlap and distinction between patterns reflected in SSRS scores and those observed in clinical ASD, highlighting the need for caution when interpreting findings only utilizing SRS as the outcome for autistic-like trait.",

Despite the numerous reports on secondary headache in the emergency department, details on pediatric headache outpatients are scarce.\nWe retrospectively reviewed the medical records of patients who first visited our outpatient headache clinic between May 2022 and October 2023 and were considered to have secondary headache.\nTwenty-seven of 68 patients (39%) were diagnosed as having secondary headache as the main illness. The gender breakdown of 20 boys and 7 girls represented a significant difference. Patient age range was 5-17\u2009years (median: 13\u2009years and 8\u2009months), and a family history of headache was noted in 20 patients (74%). Headache frequency was described as \"almost daily\" in 18 patients (67%). The main diagnosis of secondary headache was psychiatric disorders (social anxiety disorder; SAD) in 13 patients, homeostatic disorders (orthostatic dysregulation; OD) in 9 patients, facial organ-related headache (FORH) in 3 patients, and nonvascular intracranial disease in 2 patients. Comorbidities included autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in 18 patients and school refusal (SR) in 8 patients. Nine of the ASD patients were diagnosed after their headache outpatient visit.\nOur analysis of secondary headache patients in a tertiary facility revealed that roughly half of the patients had SAD, all of whom harbored ASD as a comorbidity. Many of the patients were adolescents, which coincided with the age of OD onset. When examining pediatric secondary headache patients, extra attention is warranted to developmental characteristics, particularly those of adolescents.",

        "abstract": "Despite the fact that there have been many studies on the connection between autism and psychosis, there are still many things that are unknown about the significance of this connection. Recent studies have highlighted the significant overlap between autistic traits and psychotic disorders, yet the clinical implications of these associations are not well understood. This study aims to address this knowledge gap by investigating the links between autistic features and various clinical, functional and behavioural outcomes in individuals with psychosis spectrum.\nThe study included 125 patients who had at least one psychotic episode and who had used antipsychotic medication for most of the treatment period. The clinician conducted face-to-face interviews to evaluate all other clinical characteristics, while self-report scales were employed to evaluate autistic features and quality of life. Complex associations were understood using path analysis.\nOur study showed that there was a negative association between autistic features and functioning, quality of life and subjective treatment benefit; and a positive association with severity of disorder, severity of anxiety and depression, severity of positive and negative symptoms, suicidal ideation and behaviour, psychiatric comorbidity and number of psychotic episodes. Depression intensity mediated autistic features' effect on suicidal thoughts. Those who were non-smokers and bullied by peers reported more autistic traits.\nTaken together, our results highlight the importance of autistic features in the psychosis spectrum. It is clear that there is a significant gap in clinical knowledge regarding the relationship between autism and psychosis and that further improvements in diagnostic tools and treatment options are needed. As our study is cross-sectional in design, speculation about causality is limited and further prospective research is needed.",

However, the potential association between neighborhood deprivation and T2D in ADHD patients remains underexplored. Our aim was to study the potential effect of neighborhood deprivation on incident T2D in patients with ADHD.\nThis study included adults (\nA significant association was observed between neighborhood deprivation and T2D in patients with ADHD. Among patients with ADHD residing in highly deprived neighborhoods, the HRs were 1.37 (95% CI: 1.22-1.53) for men and 1.84 (95% CI: 1.61-2.12) for women, compared to those in low-deprivation neighborhoods. After adjusting for potential confounders, the association remained significant, with HRs of 1.19 (95% CI: 1.06-1.34) in men and 1.48 (95% CI: 1.28-1.70) in women residing in highly deprived neighborhoods.\nThe increased incidence of T2D among patients with ADHD residing in deprived neighborhoods raises significant clinical and public health concerns. These findings could assist policymakers in allocating resources within primary healthcare settings and provide guidance for clinicians working with patients in deprived neighborhoods.",

        "abstract": "Rett syndrome (RS) is a rare neurodevelopmental disorder primarily affecting females, characterized by severe neurological impairment and complex comorbidities, including epilepsy, scoliosis, and respiratory dysfunction. Respiratory complications, such as recurrent infections and sleep-disordered breathing (SDB), are increasingly recognized as significant contributors to morbidity. This study aimed to evaluate the prevalence, severity, and management of major comorbidities-including epilepsy, scoliosis, respiratory infections, and SDB-in a pediatric cohort with genetically confirmed RS.\nWe conducted a retrospective review of medical records from 23 female patients under 18 years of age with MECP2 mutations, referred to our tertiary care center from 2021 to 2025. Data on epilepsy, scoliosis, respiratory infections, and nutritional status were collected. The presence of SDB was assessed through overnight home polygraphy (oPG) and transcutaneous carbon dioxide monitoring in selected cases.\nEpilepsy affected 65% of patients, all with good seizure control. Scoliosis was present in 52%, with two patients requiring spinal surgery. At least one episode of lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) was presented in 39% of our girls. LRTIs positively correlated with the number of hospitalization and antibiotic treatment. Among patients undergoing oPG, 67% presented obstructive sleep apnea, with its severity positively correlating with the frequency of lower respiratory infections. Severe nocturnal hypercapnia was documented in three patients, leading to non-invasive or invasive ventilation.\nOur findings highlight the high prevalence of sleep-related respiratory disorders and their association with respiratory infections in children with RS. Systematic respiratory assessment, including sleep studies, and early implementation of airway clearance techniques and ventilatory support are crucial to improving clinical outcomes in this vulnerable population.",

        "abstract": "Parenting an individual with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) affects the mental health of both mothers and fathers. A chronic disorder, ASD, has devastating effects on parental mental health as the affected individual moves from childhood to adulthood. While the effects of ASD on parental mental health during childhood have been studied extensively, there is limited information regarding the mental health of aging parents of the expanding adult ASD population. In this context, we aimed to determine the psychiatric symptoms (PS) levels of parents of adult with ASD, to compare the PS level between mothers and fathers, to investigate the relationship between parental PS and variables related to the individuals with ASD and their parents. To assess the parents' PS, the Brief Symptom Inventory was administered to 77 parents of adults with ASD. ASD severity was evaluated with the Childhood Autism Rating Scale, behavioral problems were assessed with the Aberrant Behavior Checklist, independence level (IL) of the cases was measured with the Lawton Instrumental Activities of Daily Living Scale, and social functioning level (SFL) of the cases was evaluated using the Social Functioning Scale. At all ages from childhood to adulthood, the most common primary caregiver was mother. Mothers' labor force participation rate was significantly lower than fathers' (p\u2009<\u20090.05). Mothers' somatization (p\u2009=\u20090.028) and depression (p\u2009=\u20090.002) levels were significantly higher than fathers'. The somatization score of the mothers of cases with comorbid medical diagnosis and intellectual disability (ID) was significantly higher than those without. The depression score of fathers of cases with ID and illiteracy was significantly higher (p\u2009<\u20090.05). The negative self-concept score of fathers of cases with ID, illiteracy, and dependent self-care and toileting was significantly higher (p\u2009<\u20090.05). As IL increased, paternal depression and negative self-concept levels decreased significantly (p\u2009<\u20090.05). When SFL increased, maternal anxiety, depression, and somatization and paternal negative self-concept levels decreased significantly (p\u2009<\u20090.05). In regression analyses, maternal anxiety was significantly associated with irritability, depression with hyperactivity, negative self-concept with irritability; somatization with irritability and the presence of medical diease in mother and patient; hostility with hyperactivity. Paternal anxiety, depression, somatization, and hostility were associated with irritability; negative self-concept with irritability and social withdrawal. It is hoped these results contribute to a better understanding of the protective and risk factors of the psychopathology of parents of adults with ASD, a topic relatively poorly studied.",

Behavioral therapy is the first-line treatment for\npatients with TS, and it helps patients raise awareness about tic occurrence as\nwell as develop tic inhibition strategies. However, the limited availability of\ntherapists and the difficulties for in-home follow up work limits its\neffectiveness. An automatic tic detection system that is easy to deploy could\nalleviate the difficulties of home-therapy by providing feedback to the\npatients while exercising tic awareness. In this work, we propose a novel\narchitecture (T-Net) for automatic tic detection and classification from\nuntrimmed videos. T-Net combines temporal detection and segmentation and\noperates on features that are interpretable to a clinician. We compare T-Net to\nseveral state-of-the-art systems working on deep features extracted from the\nraw videos and T-Net achieves comparable performance in terms of average\nprecision while relying on interpretable features needed in clinical practice.",

The details of the clustering behavior depend on the frequency and\namplitude of the stimulation in a complicated way. In the present study, we\ninvestigate how the number of clusters, their stability properties, and their\nbasins of attraction can be understood in terms of one-dimensional maps defined\non the circle. Moreover, we generalize this analysis to stimuli that consist of\npulses with alternating properties, which provide additional degrees of freedom\nin the design of DBS stimuli.

        "abstract": "Visual hallucination refers to the perception of recognizable things that are\nnot present. These phenomena are commonly linked to a range of\nneurological/psychiatric disorders. Despite ongoing research, the mechanisms\nthrough which the visual system generates hallucinations from real-world\nenvironments are still not well understood. Abnormal interactions between\ndifferent regions of the brain responsible for perception are known to\ncontribute to the occurrence of visual hallucinations. In this study, we\npropose and extend a generative neural network-based framework to address\nchallenges within the visual system, aiming to create goal-driven models\ninspired by neurobiological mechanisms of visual hallucinations. We focus on\nthe adversarial interactions between the visual system and the frontal lobe\nregions, proposing the Hallu-GAN model to suggest how these interactions can\ngive rise to visual hallucinations. The architecture of the Hallu-GAN model is\nbased on generative adversarial networks. Our simulation results indicate that\ndisturbances in the ventral stream can lead to visual hallucinations. To\nfurther analyze the impact of other brain regions on the visual system, we\nextend the Hallu-GAN model by adding EEG data from individuals. This extended\nmodel, referred to as Hallu-GAN+, enables the examination of both hallucinating\nand non-hallucinating states. By training the Hallu-GAN+ model with EEG data\nfrom an individual with Charles Bonnet syndrome, we demonstrated its utility in\nanalyzing the behavior of those experiencing hallucinations. Our simulation\nresults confirmed the capability of the proposed model in resembling the visual\nsystem in both healthy and hallucinating states.",

        "doi": "10.48550/arXiv.2311.00997",
        "abstract": "Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) involves diverse neurodevelopmental syndromes\nwith significant deficits in communication, motor behaviours, emotional and\nsocial comprehension. Often, individuals with ASD exhibit comorbid conditions,\none of the most prevalent being depression characterized by a persistent change\nin mood and diminished interest in previously enjoyable activities. Due to\ncommunicative challenges and lack of appropriate assessments in individuals\nwith ASD, comorbid depression can often go undiagnosed during routine clinical\nexaminations, which may aggravate their problems. The current literature on\ncomorbid depression in adults with ASD is limited. Therefore, understanding the\nneural basis of the comorbid psychopathology of depression in ASD is crucial\nfor identifying objective brain-based markers for its timely and effective\nmanagement. Towards this end, using structural MRI and phenotypic data from the\nAutism Brain Imaging Data Exchange II (ABIDE II) repository, we specifically\nexamined the pattern of relationship regional grey matter volume (rGMV) has\nwith comorbid depression and autism severity within regions of a priori\ninterest in adults with ASD (n = 44). The severity of comorbid depression\ncorrelated negatively with the rGMV of the right thalamus.

Surface codes are a class of topological QECCs that have\nattracted significant attention due to their exceptional error-correcting\ncapabilities and easy implementation. In the decoding process of surface codes,\nthe syndromes are crucial for error correction, however, they are not always\ncorrectly measured. Most of the existing decoding algorithms for surface codes\nneed extra measurements to correct syndromes with errors, which implies a\npotential increase in inference complexity and decoding latency. In this paper,\nwe propose a high-performance list decoding algorithm for surface codes with\nerroneous syndromes, where syndrome soft information is incorporated in the\ndecoding, allowing qubits and syndrome to be recovered without needing extra\nmeasurements. Precisely, we first use belief propagation (BP) decoding for\npre-processing with syndrome soft information, followed by ordered statistics\ndecoding (OSD) for post-processing to list and recover both qubits and\nsyndromes. Numerical results demonstrate that our proposed algorithm\nefficiently recovers erroneous syndromes and significantly improves the\ndecoding performance of surface codes with erroneous syndromes compared to\nminimum-weight perfect matching (MWPM), BP and original BP-OSD algorithms.",

In this paper, we use this \"soft\" or\nanalog information without the conventional discretization step to benefit the\niterative decoders for decoding quantum low-density parity-check (QLDPC) codes.\nSyndrome-based iterative belief propagation decoders are modified to utilize\nthe syndrome-soft information to successfully correct both data and syndrome\nerrors simultaneously, without repeated measurements. We demonstrate the\nadvantages of extracting the soft information from the syndrome in our improved\ndecoders, not only in terms of comparison of thresholds and logical error rates\nfor quasi-cyclic lifted-product QLDPC code families, but also for faster\nconvergence of iterative decoders.

We show that the brain can be modeled as a\nfunctional network, and certain properties of the networks differ in ADHD\nsubjects from control subjects. We compute the pairwise correlation of brain\nvoxels' activity over the time frame of the experimental protocol which helps\nto model the function of a brain as a network. Different network features are\ncomputed for each of the voxels constructing the network. The concatenation of\nthe network features of all the voxels in a brain serves as the feature vector.\nFeature vectors from a set of subjects are then used to train a PCA-LDA\n(principal component analysis-linear discriminant analysis) based classifier.\nWe hypothesized that ADHD-related differences lie in some specific regions of\nthe brain and using features only from those regions is sufficient to\ndiscriminate ADHD and control subjects. We propose a method to create a brain\nmask that includes the useful regions only and demonstrate that using the\nfeature from the masked regions improves classification accuracy on the test\ndata set.

This model not only\nlearns spatiotemporal individual features but also learns the correlation with\nfull attention structures specialized in ADHD diagnosis. In particular, it\nfocuses on learning local blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signals and\ndistinguishing important regions of interest (ROI) in the brain. Specifically,\nthe three proposed methods for ADHD diagnosis transformer are as follows.\nFirst, we design a CNN-based embedding block to obtain more expressive\nembedding features in brain region attention. It is reconstructed based on the\npreviously CNN-based ADHD diagnosis models for the transformer. Next, for\nindividual spatiotemporal feature attention, we change the attention method to\nlocal temporal attention and ROI-rank based masking. For the temporal features\nof fMRI, the local temporal attention enables to learn local BOLD signal\nfeatures with only simple window masking. For the spatial feature of fMRI,\nROI-rank based masking can distinguish ROIs with high correlation in ROI\nrelationships based on attention scores, thereby providing a more specific\nbiomarker for ADHD diagnosis. The experiment was conducted with various types\nof transformer models. To evaluate these models, we collected the data from 939\nindividuals from all sites provided by the ADHD-200 competition. Through this,\nthe spatiotemporal enhanced transformer for ADHD diagnosis outperforms the\nperformance of other different types of transformer variants. (77.78ACC\n76.60SPE 79.22SEN 79.30AUC)",

        "abstract": "Large, open-source consortium datasets have spurred the development of new\nand increasingly powerful machine learning approaches in brain connectomics.\nHowever, one key question remains: are we capturing biologically relevant and\ngeneralizable information about the brain, or are we simply overfitting to the\ndata? To answer this, we organized a scientific challenge, the Connectomics in\nNeuroImaging Transfer Learning Challenge (CNI-TLC), held in conjunction with\nMICCAI 2019. CNI-TLC included two classification tasks: (1) diagnosis of\nAttention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) within a pre-adolescent cohort;\nand (2) transference of the ADHD model to a related cohort of Autism Spectrum\nDisorder (ASD) patients with an ADHD comorbidity. In total, 240 resting-state\nfMRI time series averaged according to three standard parcellation atlases,\nalong with clinical diagnosis, were released for training and validation (120\nneurotypical controls and 120 ADHD). We also provided demographic information\nof age, sex, IQ, and handedness. A second set of 100 subjects (50 neurotypical\ncontrols, 25 ADHD, and 25 ASD with ADHD comorbidity) was used for testing.\nModels were submitted in a standardized format as Docker images through ChRIS,\nan open-source image analysis platform. Utilizing an inclusive approach, we\nranked the methods based on 16 different metrics. The final rank was calculated\nusing the rank product for each participant across all measures. Furthermore,\nwe assessed the calibration curves of each method. Five participants submitted\ntheir model for evaluation, with one outperforming all other methods in both\nADHD and ASD classification. However, further improvements are needed to reach\nthe clinical translation of functional connectomics. We are keeping the CNI-TLC\nopen as a publicly available resource for developing and validating new\nclassification methodologies in the field of connectomics.",

ADHD is one of the most common\nneurodevelopmental disorders in which patients have difficulties related to\ninattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity. Those patients are in need for a\npsychological therapy; the use of cognitive behavioral therapy as a\nfirmly-established treatment is to help in enhancing the way they think and\nbehave. A major limitation in traditional cognitive behavioral therapies is\nthat therapists may face difficulty to optimize patients' neuropsychological\nstimulus following a specified treatment plan, i.e., therapists struggle to\ndraw clear images when stimulating patients' mindset to a point where they\nshould be. Other limitations recognized here include availability,\naccessibility and level-of-experience of the therapists.

        "abstract": "Many existing methods that use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)\nclassify brain disorders, such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and attention\ndeficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), often overlook the integration of\nspatial and temporal dependencies of the blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD)\nsignals, which may lead to inaccurate or imprecise classification results. To\nsolve this problem, we propose a Spatio-Temporal Aggregation eorganization\nransformer (STARFormer) that effectively captures both spatial and temporal\nfeatures of BOLD signals by incorporating three key modules. The region of\ninterest (ROI) spatial structure analysis module uses eigenvector centrality\n(EC) to reorganize brain regions based on effective connectivity, highlighting\ncritical spatial relationships relevant to the brain disorder. The temporal\nfeature reorganization module systematically segments the time series into\nequal-dimensional window tokens and captures multiscale features through\nvariable window and cross-window attention. The spatio-temporal feature fusion\nmodule employs a parallel transformer architecture with dedicated temporal and\nspatial branches to extract integrated features. The proposed STARFormer has\nbeen rigorously evaluated on two publicly available datasets for the\nclassification of ASD and ADHD. The experimental results confirm that the\nSTARFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple evaluation\nmetrics, providing a more accurate and reliable tool for the diagnosis of brain\ndisorders and biomedical research.

        "abstract": "Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a common brain disorder in\nchildren that can persist into adulthood, affecting social, academic, and\ncareer life. Early diagnosis is crucial for managing these impacts on patients\nand the healthcare system but is often labor-intensive and time-consuming. This\npaper presents a novel method to improve ADHD diagnosis precision and\ntimeliness by leveraging Deep Learning (DL) approaches and electroencephalogram\n(EEG) signals. We introduce ADHDeepNet, a DL model that utilizes comprehensive\ntemporal-spatial characterization, attention modules, and explainability\ntechniques optimized for EEG signals. ADHDeepNet integrates feature extraction\nand refinement processes to enhance ADHD diagnosis. The model was trained and\nvalidated on a dataset of 121 participants (61 ADHD, 60 Healthy Controls),\nemploying nested cross-validation for robust performance. The proposed\ntwo-stage methodology uses a 10-fold cross-subject validation strategy.\nInitially, each iteration optimizes the model's hyper-parameters with inner\n2-fold cross-validation. Then, Additive Gaussian Noise (AGN) with various\nstandard deviations and magnification levels is applied for data augmentation.\nADHDeepNet achieved 100% sensitivity and 99.17% accuracy in classifying ADHD/HC\nsubjects. To clarify model explainability and identify key brain regions and\nfrequency bands for ADHD diagnosis, we analyzed the learned weights and\nactivation patterns of the model's primary layers. Additionally, t-distributed\nStochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) visualized high-dimensional data, aiding\nin interpreting the model's decisions.

The University of California Los Angeles dataset, which\ncontains the rs-fMRI modalities of SZ and ADHD patients, has been used for\nexperiments. The FMRIB software library toolbox first performed preprocessing\non rs-fMRI data. Then, a convolutional Autoencoder model with the proposed\nnumber of layers is used to extract features from rs-fMRI data. In the\nclassification step, a new fuzzy method called interval type-2 fuzzy regression\n(IT2FR) is introduced and then optimized by genetic algorithm, particle swarm\noptimization, and gray wolf optimization (GWO) techniques. Also, the results of\nIT2FR methods are compared with multilayer perceptron, k-nearest neighbors,\nsupport vector machine, random forest, and decision tree, and adaptive\nneuro-fuzzy inference system methods.

Despite good spatial resolution, time\nresolution of these methods are poor and values are about seconds.\nElectroencephalography (EEG) is a popular non-invasive electrophysiological\ntechnique of relatively very high time resolution which is used to measure\nelectric potential of brain neural activity. Scalp EEG recordings can be used\nto perform the inverse problem in order to specify the location of the dominant\nsources of the brain activity. In this paper, EEG source localization research\nis clustered as follows: solving the inverse problem by statistical method\n(37.5%), diagnosis of brain abnormalities using common EEG source localization\nmethods (18.33%), improving EEG source localization methods by non-statistical\nstrategies (3.33%), investigating the effect of the head model on EEG source\nimaging results (12.5%), detection of epileptic seizures by brain activity\nlocalization based on EEG signals (20%), diagnosis and treatment of ADHD\nabnormalities (8.33%). Among the available methods, minimum norm solution has\nshown to be very promising for sources with different depths. This review\ninvestigates diseases that are diagnosed using EEG source localization\ntechniques.

        "abstract": "eXtended Reality (XR) autism research, ranging from Augmented Reality to\nVirtual Reality, focuses on socio-emotional abilities and high-functioning\nautism. However common autism interventions address the entire spectrum over\nsocial, sensory and mediation issues. To bridge the gap between autism research\nand real interventions, we compared existing literature on XR and autism with\nstakeholders' needs obtained by interviewing 34 skateholders, mainly\npractitioners. It allow us first to suggest XR use cases that could better\nsupport practitioners' interventions, and second to derive design guidelines\naccordingly. Findings demonstrate that collaborative XR sensory-based and\nmediation approaches would benefit the entire spectrum, and encourage to\nconsider the overall intervention context when designing XR protocols.",

Several prior efforts conducted\nby a multitude of research labs have spawned great progress towards improved\ndigital diagnostics and digital therapies for children with autism. We review\nthe literature of digital health methods for autism behavior quantification\nusing data science. We describe both case-control studies and classification\nsystems for digital phenotyping. We then discuss digital diagnostics and\ntherapeutics which integrate machine learning models of autism-related\nbehaviors, including the factors which must be addressed for translational use.\nFinally, we describe ongoing challenges and potent opportunities for the field\nof autism data science. Given the heterogeneous nature of autism and the\ncomplexities of the relevant behaviors, this review contains insights which are\nrelevant to neurological behavior analysis and digital psychiatry more broadly.",

        "abstract": "Recent studies have revealed that using social robots can accelerate the\nlearning process of several skills in areas where autistic children typically\nshow deficits. However, most early research studies conducted interactions via\nfree play. More recent research has demonstrated that robot-mediated autism\ntherapies focusing on core impairments of autism spectrum disorder (e.g., joint\nattention) yield better results than unstructured interactions. This paper aims\nto systematically review the most relevant findings concerning the application\nof social robotics to joint attention tasks, a cardinal feature of autism\nspectrum disorder that significantly influences the neurodevelopmental\ntrajectory of autistic children. Initially, we define autism spectrum disorder\nand explore its societal implications. Following this, we examine the need for\ntechnological aid and the potentialities of robot-assisted autism therapy. We\nthen define joint attention and highlight its crucial role in children's social\nand cognitive development. Subsequently, we analyze the importance of\nstructured interactions and the role of selecting the optimal robot for\nspecific tasks. This is followed by a comparative analysis of the works\nreviewed earlier, presenting an in-depth examination of two distinct formal\nmodels employed to design the prompts and reward system that enables the robot\nto adapt to children's responses. These models are critically compared to\nhighlight their strengths and limitations. Next, we introduce a novel algorithm\nto address the identified limitations, integrating interactive environmental\nfactors and a more sophisticated prompting and reward system. Finally, we\npropose further research directions, discuss the most relevant open questions,\nand draw conclusions regarding the effectiveness of social robotics in the\nmedical treatment of autism spectrum disorders.",

        "abstract": "There are currently many tutoring software systems which have been designed\nfor neurotypical children. These systems cover academic topics such as reading\nand math, and are made available through various technological mediums. The\nmajority of these systems were not designed for use by children with special\nneeds, in particular those who are diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder.\nSince the 1970's, studies have been conducted on the use of Applied Behavior\nAnalysis to help autistic children learn [1]. This teaching methodology is\nproven to be very effective, with many patients having their diagnosis of\nautism dropped after a few years of treatment. With the advent of ubiquitous\ntechnologies such as mobile devices, it has become apparent that these devices\ncould also be used to help tutor autistic children on academic subjects such as\nreading and math. Though the delivery of tutoring material must be made using\nApplied Behavior Analysis techniques, given that ABA therapy is currently the\nonly form of treatment for Autism Spectrum Disorder endorsed by the US Surgeon\nGeneral [2], which further makes the case for incorporating it into an\nacademics tutoring system tailored for autistic children. In this paper, we\npresent a mobile software system which can be utilized to tutor children who\nare diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder in the subjects of reading and\nmath.

        "abstract": "Autism Spectrum Disorder is a condition characterized by a typical brain\ndevelopment leading to impairments in social skills, communication abilities,\nrepetitive behaviors, and sensory processing. There have been many studies\ncombining brain MRI images with machine learning algorithms to achieve\nobjective diagnosis of autism, but the correlation between white matter and\nautism has not been fully utilized. To address this gap, we develop a\ncomputer-aided diagnostic model focusing on white matter regions in brain MRI\nby employing radiomics and machine learning methods. This study introduced a\nMultiUNet model for segmenting white matter, leveraging the UNet architecture\nand utilizing manually segmented MRI images as the training data. Subsequently,\nwe extracted white matter features using the Pyradiomics toolkit and applied\ndifferent machine learning models such as Support Vector Machine, Random\nForest, Logistic Regression, and K-Nearest Neighbors to predict autism. The\nprediction sets all exceeded 80% accuracy. Additionally, we employed\nConvolutional Neural Network to analyze segmented white matter images,\nachieving a prediction accuracy of 86.84%. Notably, Support Vector Machine\ndemonstrated the highest prediction accuracy at 89.47%. These findings not only\nunderscore the efficacy of the models but also establish a link between white\nmatter abnormalities and autism. Our study contributes to a comprehensive\nevaluation of various diagnostic models for autism and introduces a\ncomputer-aided diagnostic algorithm for early and objective autism diagnosis\nbased on MRI white matter regions.",

        "abstract": "Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder which results\nin altered behavior, social development, and communication patterns. In past\nyears, autism prevalence has tripled, with 1 in 54 children now affected. Given\nthat traditional diagnosis is a lengthy, labor-intensive process, significant\nattention has been given to developing systems that automatically screen for\nautism. Prosody abnormalities are among the clearest signs of autism, with\naffected children displaying speech idiosyncrasies including echolalia,\nmonotonous intonation, atypical pitch, and irregular linguistic stress\npatterns. In this work, we present a suite of machine learning approaches to\ndetect autism in self-recorded speech audio captured from autistic and\nneurotypical (NT) children in home environments. We consider three methods to\ndetect autism in child speech: first, Random Forests trained on extracted audio\nfeatures (including Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients); second, convolutional\nneural networks (CNNs) trained on spectrograms; and third, fine-tuned wav2vec\n2.0--a state-of-the-art Transformer-based ASR model. We train our classifiers\non our novel dataset of cellphone-recorded child speech audio curated from\nStanford's Guess What? mobile game, an app designed to crowdsource videos of\nautistic and neurotypical children in a natural home environment. The Random\nForest classifier achieves 70% accuracy, the fine-tuned wav2vec 2.0 model\nachieves 77% accuracy, and the CNN achieves 79% accuracy when classifying\nchildren's audio as either ASD or NT. Our models were able to predict autism\nstatus when training on a varied selection of home audio clips with\ninconsistent recording quality, which may be more generalizable to real world\nconditions. These results demonstrate that machine learning methods offer\npromise in detecting autism automatically from speech without specialized\nequipment.",

        "abstract": "Neural activity in the brain of parkinsonian patients is characterized by the\nintermittently synchronized oscillatory dynamics. This imperfect\nsynchronization, observed in the beta frequency band, is believed to be related\nto the hypokinetic motor symptoms of the disorder. Our study explores potential\nmechanisms behind this intermittent synchrony. We study the response of a\nbursting pallidal neuron to different patterns of synaptic input from\nsubthalamic nucleus (STN) neuron. We show how external globus pallidus (GPe)\nneuron is sensitive to the phase of the input from the STN cell and can exhibit\nintermittent phase-locking with the input in the beta band. The temporal\nproperties of this intermittent phase-locking show similarities to the\nintermittent synchronization observed in experiments. We also study the\nsynchronization of GPe cells to synaptic input from the STN cell with\ndependence on the dopamine-modulated parameters. Dopamine also affects the\ncellular properties of neurons. We show how the changes in firing patterns of\nSTN neuron due to the lack of dopamine may lead to transition from a lower to a\nhigher coherent state, roughly matching the synchrony levels observed in basal\nganglia in normal and parkinsonian states. The intermittent nature of the\nneural beta band synchrony in Parkinson's disease is achieved in the model due\nto the interplay of the timing of STN input to pallidum and pallidal neuronal\ndynamics, resulting in sensitivity of pallidal output to the phase of the\narriving STN input. Thus the mechanism considered here (the change in firing\npattern of subthalamic neurons through the dopamine-induced change of membrane\nproperties) may be one of the potential mechanisms responsible for the\ngeneration of the intermittent synchronization observed in Parkinson's disease.",

        "abstract": "Neurodevelopmental disorders (NDD), encompassing conditions like Intellectual\nDisability, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, and Autism Spectrum\nDisorder, present challenges across various cognitive capacities. Attention\ndeficits are often common in individuals with NDD due to the sensory system\ndysfunction that characterizes these disorders. Consequently, limited attention\ncapability can affect the overall quality of life and the ability to transfer\nknowledge from one circumstance to another. The literature has increasingly\nrecognized the potential benefits of virtual reality (VR) in supporting NDD\nlearning and rehabilitation due to its interactive and engaging nature, which\nis critical for consistent practice. In previous studies, we explored the usage\nof a VR application called Wildcard to enhance attention skills in persons with\nNDD. The application has been redesigned in this study, exploiting eye-tracking\ntechnology to enable novel and more fine-grade interactions. A four-week\nexperiment with 38 NDD participants was conducted to evaluate its usability and\neffectiveness in improving Visual Attention Skills. Results show the usability\nand effectiveness of Wildcard in enhancing attention skills, advocating for\ncontinued exploration of VR and eye-tracking technology's potential in NDD\ninterventions.",

        "abstract": "Divergent brain connectivity is thought to underlie the behavioral and\ncognitive symptoms observed in many neurodevelopmental disorders. Quantifying\ndivergence from neurotypical connectivity patterns offers a promising pathway\nto inform diagnosis and therapeutic interventions. While advanced neuroimaging\ntechniques, such as diffusion MRI (dMRI), have facilitated the mapping of\nbrain's structural connectome, the challenge lies in accurately modeling\ndevelopmental trajectories within these complex networked structures to create\nrobust neurodivergence markers. In this work, we present the Brain\nRepresentation via Individualized Deep Generative Embedding (BRIDGE) framework,\nwhich integrates normative modeling with a bio-inspired deep generative model\nto create a reference trajectory of connectivity transformation as part of\nneurotypical development. This will enable the assessment of neurodivergence by\ncomparing individuals to the established neurotypical trajectory. BRIDGE\nprovides a global neurodivergence score based on the difference between\nconnectivity-based brain age and chronological age, along with region-wise\nneurodivergence maps that highlight localized connectivity differences.\nApplication of BRIDGE to a large cohort of children with autism spectrum\ndisorder demonstrates that the global neurodivergence score correlates with\nclinical assessments in autism, and the regional map offers insights into the\nheterogeneity at the individual level in neurodevelopmental disorders.\nTogether, the neurodivergence score and map form powerful tools for quantifying\ndevelopmental divergence in connectivity patterns, advancing the development of\nimaging markers for personalized diagnosis and intervention in various clinical\ncontexts.",

As proof of principle, this study presents a Generative Adversarial\nNetwork capable of generating synthetic ERG signals of children with ASD and\ntypically developing control individuals.

        "abstract": "Dysgraphia is a neurodevelopmental condition in which children encounter\ndifficulties in handwriting. Dysgraphia is not a disorder per se, but is\nsecondary to neurodevelopmental disorders, mainly dyslexia, Developmental\nCoordination Disorder (DCD, also known as dyspraxia) or Attention Deficit\nHyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). Since the mastering of handwriting is central\nfor the further acquisition of other skills such as orthograph or syntax, an\nearly diagnosis and handling of dysgraphia is thus essential for the academic\nsuccess of children. In this paper, we investigated a large handwriting\ndatabase composed of 36 individual symbols (26 isolated letters of the Latin\nalphabet written in cursive and the 10 digits) written by 545 children from 6,5\nto 16 years old, among which 66 displayed dysgraphia (around 12\\%). To better\nunderstand the dynamics of handwriting, mathematical models of nonpathological\nhandwriting have been proposed, assuming oscillatory and fluid generation of\nstrokes (Parsimonious Oscillatory Model of Handwriting [Andr\\'e, 2014]). The\npurpose of this work is to study how such models behave when applied to\nchildren dysgraphic handwriting, and whether a lack of fit may help in the\ndiagnosis, using a two-layer classification procedure with different\ncompositions of classification algorithms.",

Aspects of two neurodevelopmental disorders, autism and\nschizophrenia, are modelled using SOM networks, based on existing\nneurocomputational theories.

Often associated with severe adverse impacts on\nthe formation of vital central and peripheral nervous systems during the\nneurodevelopmental process, NDDs are comprised of a broad spectrum of\ndisorders, such as autism spectrum disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity\ndisorder, and epilepsy, characterized by progressive and pervasive detriments\nto cognitive, speech, memory, motor, and other neurological functions in\npatients. However, the heterogeneous nature of NDDs poses a significant\nroadblock to identifying the exact pathogenesis, impeding accurate diagnosis\nand the development of targeted treatment planning. A computational NDDs model\nholds immense potential in enhancing our understanding of the multifaceted\nfactors involved and could assist in identifying the root causes to expedite\ntreatment development. To tackle this challenge, we introduce optimal\nneurotrophin concentration to the driving force and degradation of neurotrophin\nto the synaptogenesis process of a 2D phase field neuron growth model using\nisogeometric analysis to simulate neurite retraction and atrophy. The optimal\nneurotrophin concentration effectively captures the inverse relationship\nbetween neurotrophin levels and neurite survival, while its degradation\nregulates concentration levels. Leveraging dynamic domain expansion, the model\nefficiently expands the domain based on outgrowth patterns to minimize degrees\nof freedom. Based on truncated T-splines, our model simulates the evolving\nprocess of complex neurite structures by applying local refinement adaptively\nto the cell/neurite boundary. Furthermore, a thorough parameter investigation\nis conducted with detailed comparisons against neuron cell cultures in\nexperiments, enhancing our fundamental understanding of the mechanisms\nunderlying NDDs.",

        "abstract": "Technology presents a significant educational opportunity, particularly in\nenhancing emotional engagement and expanding learning and educational prospects\nfor individuals with Neurodevelopmental Disorders (NDD). Virtual reality\nemerges as a promising tool for addressing such disorders, complemented by\nnumerous touchscreen applications that have shown efficacy in fostering\neducation and learning abilities. VR and touchscreen technologies represent\ndiverse interface modalities. This study primarily investigates which\ninterface, VR or touchscreen, more effectively facilitates food education for\nindividuals with NDD. We compared learning outcomes via pre- and post-exposure\nquestionnaires. To this end, we developed GEA, a dual-interface, user-friendly\nweb application for Food Education, adaptable for either immersive use in a\nhead-mounted display (HMD) or non-immersive use on a tablet. A controlled study\nwas conducted to determine which interface better promotes learning. Over three\nsessions, the experimental group engaged with all GEA games in VR (condition\nA), while the control group interacted with the same games on a tablet\n(condition B). Results indicated a significant increase in post-questionnaire\nscores across subjects, averaging a 46% improvement. This enhancement was\nnotably consistent between groups, with VR and Tablet groups showing 42% and\n41% improvements, respectively.",

The study utilised a dataset of 39 video recordings, capturing\nextensive sessions where clinicians administered, among other things, four\ncognitive assessment tests. From the first 40 minutes of each clinical session,\ncovering the administration of the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children\n(WISC-V), we extracted head positions and speech turns of both clinician and\nchild. Despite the limited sample size and heterogeneous recording styles, the\nanalysis successfully extracted path signatures as features from the recorded\ndata, focusing on patient-clinician interactions. Importantly, these features\nquantify the interpersonal dynamics of the assessment process (dialogue and\nmovement patterns). Results suggest that these features exhibit promising\npotential for predicting all cognitive tests scores of the entire session\nlength and for prototyping a predictive model as a clinical decision support\ntool. Overall, this proof of concept demonstrates the feasibility of leveraging\nmachine learning techniques for clinical video and speech data analysis in\norder to potentially enhance the efficiency of cognitive assessments for\nneurodevelopmental disorders in children.",

        "abstract": "Developing interpretable models for neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs)\ndiagnosis presents significant challenges in effectively encoding, decoding,\nand integrating multimodal neuroimaging data. While many existing machine\nlearning approaches have shown promise in brain network analysis, they\ntypically suffer from limited interpretability, particularly in extracting\nmeaningful biomarkers from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data\nand establishing clear relationships between imaging features and demographic\ncharacteristics. Besides, current graph neural network methodologies face\nlimitations in capturing both local and global functional connectivity patterns\nwhile simultaneously achieving theoretically principled multimodal data fusion.\nTo address these challenges, we propose the Interpretable Information\nBottleneck Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network (I2B-HGNN), a unified framework\nthat applies information bottleneck principles to guide both brain connectivity\nmodeling and cross-modal feature integration. This framework comprises two\ncomplementary components. The first is the Information Bottleneck Graph\nTransformer (IBGraphFormer), which combines transformer-based global attention\nmechanisms with graph neural networks through information bottleneck-guided\npooling to identify sufficient biomarkers. The second is the Information\nBottleneck Heterogeneous Graph Attention Network (IB-HGAN), which employs\nmeta-path-based heterogeneous graph learning with structural consistency\nconstraints to achieve interpretable fusion of neuroimaging and demographic\ndata. The experimental results demonstrate that I2B-HGNN achieves superior\nperformance in diagnosing NDDs, exhibiting both high classification accuracy\nand the ability to provide interpretable biomarker identification while\neffectively analyzing non-imaging data.",

        "abstract": "Tic Tac Toe is amongst the most well-known games. It has already been shown\nthat it is a biased game, giving more chances to win for the first player\nleaving only a draw or a loss as possibilities for the opponent, assuming both\nthe players play optimally. Thus on average majority of the games played result\nin a draw. The majority of the latest research on how to solve a tic tac toe\nboard state employs strategies such as Genetic Algorithms, Neural Networks,\nCo-Evolution, and Evolutionary Programming. But these approaches deal with a\ntrivial board state of 3X3 and very little research has been done for a\ngeneralized algorithm to solve 4X4,5X5,6X6 and many higher states. Even though\nan algorithm exists which is Min-Max but it takes a lot of time in coming up\nwith an ideal move due to its recursive nature of implementation. A Sample has\nbeen created on this link \\url{https://bk-tic-tac-toe.herokuapp.com/} to prove\nthis fact. This is the main problem that this study is aimed at solving i.e\nproviding a generalized algorithm(Approximate method, Learning-Based) for\nhigher board states of tic tac toe to make precise moves in a short period.\nAlso, the code changes needed to accommodate higher board states will be\nnominal. The idea is to pose the tic tac toe game as a well-posed learning\nproblem. The study and its results are promising, giving a high win to draw\nratio with each epoch of training. This study could also be encouraging for\nother researchers to apply the same algorithm to other similar board games like\nMinesweeper, Chess, and GO for finding efficient strategies and comparing the\nresults.",

        "abstract": "Friendship formation is important to online social network sites and to\nsociety, but can suffer from informational friction. In this study, we\ndemonstrate that social networks may effectively use an IT-facilitated\nintervention -- displaying things in common (TIC) between users (mutual\nhometown, interest, education, work, city) -- to encourage friendship\nformation. Displaying TIC updates an individual's belief about the shared\nsimilarity with another and reduces information friction that may be hard to\novercome in offline communication. In collaboration with an online social\nnetwork, we conduct a randomized field experiment that randomly varies the\nprominence of different things in common when a user is browsing a non-friend's\nprofile. The dyad-level exogenous variation, orthogonal to any (un)observed\nstructural factors in viewer-profile's network, allows us to cleanly isolate\nthe role of preferences for TIC in driving network formation and homophily. We\nfind that displaying TICs to viewers can significantly increase their\nprobability of sending a friend requests and forming friendships, and is\nespecially effective for pairs of people who have little in common. We also\nfind that displaying TIC can improve friendship formation for a wide range of\nviewers with different demographics and is more effective when the TICs are\nmore surprising to the viewer.",

We briefly discuss the leading\nhypotheses about the licensing contexts that allow negative polarity items and\nevaluate to what extent a neural language model has the ability to correctly\nprocess a subset of such constructions. We show that the model finds a relation\nbetween the licensing context and the negative polarity item and appears to be\naware of the scope of this context, which we extract from a parse tree of the\nsentence.

        "doi": "10.48550/arXiv.1611.06485",
        "abstract": "Despite extensive research and remarkable advancements in the control of\ncomplex dynamical networks, most studies and practical control methods limit\ntheir focus to time-invariant control schedules (TICS). This is both due to\ntheir simplicity and the fact that the benefits of time-varying control\nschedules (TVCS) have remained largely uncharacterized. In this paper we study\nnetworks with linear and discrete-time dynamics and analyze the role of network\nstructure in TVCS. First, we show that TVCS can significantly enhance network\ncontrollability over TICS, especially when applied to large networks. Through\nthe analysis of a scale-dependent notion of nodal centrality, we then show that\noptimal TVCS involves the actuation of the most central nodes at appropriate\nspatial scales at all times. Consequently, it is the scale-heterogeneity of the\ncentral-nodes in a network that determine whether, and to what extent, TVCS\noutperforms conventional policies based on TICS. Here, scale-heterogeneity of a\nnetwork refers to how diverse the central nodes of the network are at different\nspatial (local vs. global) scales. Several analytical results and case studies\nsupport and illustrate this relationship.",

Generally the systems exhibit an ordered\nand a disordered phase separated by a phase boundary on which the static\ncritical exponents appear to be independent of bond randomness in the strong\ndisorder regime, while the dynamical exponent is a continuous function of the\nbond disorder strength. The low-energy fixed points of the off-critical phases\nare affected by the actual form of the disorder, and the disorder induced\ndynamical exponent depends on the disorder strength.

Cognitive\nimpairments appear to relate to structural brain abnormalities in BD, but\nwhether core deficits are related to particular brain regions is unclear and\nmuch of the research on brain-cognition associations is limited by univariate\nanalysis and small samples.\n  Methods: Euthymic BD patients (n=56) and matched healthy controls (n=26)\nunderwent T1-weighted MRI scans and completed neuropsychological tests of PS,\nattention, and EF. We utilised public datasets to develop a normative model of\ncortical thickness (n=5,977) to generate robust estimations of cortical\nabnormalities in patients. Canonical correlation analysis was used to assess\nmultivariate brain-cognition associations in BD, controlling for age, sex, and\npremorbid IQ.\n  Results: BD showed impairments on tests of PS, attention, and EF, and\nabnormal cortical thickness in several brain regions compared to healthy\ncontrols. Impairments in tests of PS and EF were most strongly associated with\ncortical thickness in left inferior temporal, right entorhinal, and right\ntemporal pole areas.\n  Conclusion: Impairments in PS, attention, and EF can be observed in euthymic\nBD and may be related to abnormal cortical thickness in temporal regions.\nFuture research should continue to leverage multivariate methods to examine\ncomplex brain-cognition associations in BD.

        "doi": "10.48550/arXiv.2401.05343",
        "abstract": "Topological data analysis (TDA) has become a powerful approach over the last\ntwenty years, mainly due to its ability to capture the shape and the geometry\ninherent in the data. Persistence homology, which is a particular tool in TDA,\nhas been demonstrated to be successful in analyzing functional brain\nconnectivity. One limitation of standard approaches is that they use\narbitrarily chosen threshold values for analyzing connectivity matrices. To\novercome this weakness, TDA provides a filtration of the weighted brain network\nacross a range of threshold values. However, current analyses of the\ntopological structure of functional brain connectivity primarily rely on overly\nsimplistic connectivity measures, such as the Pearson orrelation. These\nmeasures do not provide information about the specific oscillators that drive\ndependence within the brain network. Here, we develop a frequency-specific\napproach that utilizes coherence, a measure of dependence in the spectral\ndomain, to evaluate the functional connectivity of the brain. Our approach, the\nspectral TDA (STDA), has the ability to capture more nuanced and detailed\ninformation about the underlying brain networks. The proposed STDA method leads\nto a novel topological summary, the spectral landscape, which is a\n2D-generalization of the persistence landscape. Using the novel spectral\nlandscape, we analyze the EEG brain connectivity of patients with attention\ndeficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and shed light on the frequency-specific\ndifferences in the topology of brain connectivity between the controls and ADHD\npatients.",

        "abstract": "Identifying unusual brain activity is a crucial task in neuroscience\nresearch, as it aids in the early detection of brain disorders. It is common to\nrepresent brain networks as graphs, and researchers have developed various\ngraph-based machine learning methods for analyzing them. However, the majority\nof existing graph learning tools for the brain face a combination of the\nfollowing three key limitations. First, they focus only on pairwise\ncorrelations between regions of the brain, limiting their ability to capture\nsynchronized activity among larger groups of regions. Second, they model the\nbrain network as a static network, overlooking the temporal changes in the\nbrain. Third, most are designed only for classifying brain networks as healthy\nor disordered, lacking the ability to identify abnormal brain activity patterns\nlinked to biomarkers associated with disorders. To address these issues, we\npresent HyperBrain, an unsupervised anomaly detection framework for temporal\nhypergraph brain networks. HyperBrain models fMRI time series data as temporal\nhypergraphs capturing dynamic higher-order interactions. It then uses a novel\ncustomized temporal walk (BrainWalk) and neural encodings to detect abnormal\nco-activations among brain regions. We evaluate the performance of HyperBrain\nin both synthetic and real-world settings for Autism Spectrum Disorder and\nAttention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder(ADHD). HyperBrain outperforms all\nother baselines on detecting abnormal co-activations in brain networks.\nFurthermore, results obtained from HyperBrain are consistent with clinical\nresearch on these brain disorders. Our findings suggest that learning temporal\nand higher-order connections in the brain provides a promising approach to\nuncover intricate connectivity patterns in brain networks, offering improved\ndiagnosis.",

        "abstract": "In neuroimaging analysis, fMRI can well assess the function changes for brain\ndiseases with no obvious structural lesions. To date, most deep-learning-based\nfMRI studies have employed functional connectivity (FC) as the basic feature\nfor disease classification. However, FC is calculated on time series of\npredefined regions of interest and neglects detailed information contained in\neach voxel. Another drawback of using FC is the limited sample size for the\ntraining of deep models. The low representation ability of FC leads to poor\nperformance in clinical practice, especially when dealing with multimodal\nmedical data involving multiple types of visual signals and textual records for\nbrain diseases. To overcome this bottleneck problem in the fMRI feature\nmodality, we propose BrainFormer, an end-to-end functional interaction learning\nmethod for brain disease classification with single fMRI volume. Unlike\ntraditional deep learning methods that construct convolution and transformers\non FC, BrainFormer learns the functional interaction from fMRI signals, by\nmodeling the local cues within each voxel with 3D convolutions and capturing\nthe global correlations among distant regions with specially designed global\nattention mechanisms from shallow layers to deep layers. Meanwhile, BrainFormer\ncan deal with multimodal medical data including fMRI volume, structural MRI, FC\nfeatures and phenotypic data to achieve more comprehensive brain disease\ndiagnosis. We evaluate BrainFormer on five independent multi-site datasets on\nautism, Alzheimer's disease, depression, attention deficit hyperactivity\ndisorder and headache disorders. The results demonstrate its effectiveness and\ngeneralizability for multiple brain diseases diagnosis with multimodal\nfeatures. BrainFormer may promote precision of neuroimaging-based diagnosis in\nclinical practice and motivate future studies on fMRI analysis.",

        "abstract": "Graphical models play an important role in neuroscience studies, particularly\nin brain connectivity analysis. Typically, observations/samples are from\nseveral heterogenous groups and the group membership of each observation/sample\nis unavailable, which poses a great challenge for graph structure learning. In\nthis article, we propose a method which can achieve Simultaneous Clustering and\nEstimation of Heterogeneous Graphs (briefly denoted as SCEHG) for\nmatrix-variate function Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) data. Unlike the\nconventional clustering methods which rely on the mean differences of various\ngroups, the proposed SCEHG method fully exploits the group differences of\nconditional dependence relationships among brain regions for learning cluster\nstructure. In essence, by constructing individual-level between-region network\nmeasures, we formulate clustering as penalized regression with grouping and\nsparsity pursuit, which transforms the unsupervised learning into supervised\nlearning. An ADMM algorithm is proposed to solve the corresponding optimization\nproblem. We also propose a generalized criterion to specify the number of\nclusters. Extensive simulation studies illustrate the superiority of the SCEHG\nmethod over some state-of-the-art methods in terms of both clustering and graph\nrecovery accuracy. We also apply the SCEHG procedure to analyze fMRI data\nassociated with ADHD (abbreviated for Attention Deficit Hyperactivity\nDisorder), which illustrate its empirical usefulness.

The release\ndynamics of neurotransmitters is correlated with but distinct from neuronal\nelectrical signal propagation. It is therefore necessary to track\nneurotransmitter modulation separately from neuron electrical activity. Here,\nwe present a new approach for imaging deuterated neurotransmitter molecules\nwith stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) microscopy. Using SRS microscopy, we\nperform direct imaging of deuterated dopamine and GABA in PC12 chromaffin\ncells, and in primary hippocampal neurons, respectively, based on the\ncarbon-deuterium vibrational frequencies. We demonstrate that SRS imaging of\nthese isotopologues directly visualizes intracellular neurotransmitters without\nchanging the neurotransmitters' chemical identity and requiring custom\nsynthesis or genetic encoding protocols. We further show that stimulation of\nneurotransmitter release results in an overall 20-50 percent intracellular\nneurotransmitter signal reduction, in agreement with comparable\nneurotransmission dynamics studies, with the ability to observe inter- and\nintracellular variation in vesicular neurotransmitter release. Taken together,\nour data suggest that neurotransmitter isotopologues can serve as a\ncommercially-available, biocompatible, and generalizable method to image\nneurotransmitters with deuterated molecules that are virtually chemically\nidentical to their native counterparts.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we are aiming to propose a novel mathematical model that\nstudies the dynamics of synaptic damage in terms of concentrations of toxic\nneuropeptides/neurotransmitters during neurotransmission processes. Our primary\nobjective is to employ Wardrop's first and second principles within a neural\nnetwork of the brain. In order to comprehensively incorporate Wardrop's first\nand second principles into the neural network of the brain, we introduce two\nnovel concepts: \\textit{neuropeptide's (neurotransmitter's) equilibrium} and\n\\textit{synapses optimum}. The \\textit{neuropeptide/neurotransmitter\nequilibrium} refers to \\textit{a distribution of toxic\nneuropeptides/neurotransmitters that leads to uniform damage across all\nsynaptic links}. Meanwhile, \\textit{synapses optimum} is \\textit{the most\ndesirable distribution of toxic neuropeptides/neurotransmitters that minimizes\nthe cumulative damage experienced by all synapses}. In the context of a neural\nnetwork within the brain, an analogue of the price of anarchy is \\textit{the\nprice of cognition} which is \\textit{the most unfavorable ratio between the\noverall impairment caused by toxic neuropeptide's (neurotransmitter's)\nequilibrium in comparison to the optimal state of synapses (synapses optimum)}.\nTo put it differently, \\textit{the price of cognition} measures \\textit{the\nloss of cognitive ability resulting from increased concentrations of toxic\nneuropeptides/neurotransmitters}. Additionally, a replicator equation is\nproposed within this framework that leads to the establishment of the synapses\noptimum during the neurotransmission process.",

        "abstract": "Volume transmission is an important neural communication pathway in which\nneurons in one brain region influence the neurotransmitter concentration in the\nextracellular space of a distant brain region. In this paper, we apply\nasymptotic analysis to a stochastic partial differential equation model of\nvolume transmission to calculate the neurotransmitter concentration in the\nextracellular space. Our model involves the diffusion equation in a\nthree-dimensional domain with interior holes that randomly switch between being\neither sources or sinks. These holes model nerve varicosities that alternate\nbetween releasing and absorbing neurotransmitter, according to when they fire\naction potentials. In the case that the holes are small, we compute\nanalytically the first two nonzero terms in an asymptotic expansion of the\naverage neurotransmitter concentration. The first term shows that the\nconcentration is spatially constant to leading order and that this constant is\nindependent of many details in the problem. Specifically, this constant first\nterm is independent of the number and location of nerve varicosities, neural\nfiring correlations, and the size and geometry of the extracellular space. The\nsecond term shows how these factors affect the concentration at second order.\nInterestingly, the second term is also spatially constant under some mild\nassumptions. We verify our asymptotic results by high-order numerical\nsimulation using radial basis function-generated finite differences.",

        "abstract": "A pre-synaptic neuron releases diffusing neurotransmitters such as glutamate\nthat activate post-synaptic receptors. The amplitude of the post-synaptic\ncurrent, mostly mediated by glutamatergic (AMPARs) receptors, is a fundamental\nsignal that may generate an action potential. However, although various\nsimulation results \\cite{kullman,Barbour,Raghavachari} have addressed how\nsynapses control the post-synaptic current, it is still unclear how this\ncurrent depends analytically on factors such as the synaptic cleft geometry,\nthe distribution, the number and the multi-conductance state of receptors, the\ngeometry of post-synaptic density (PSD) and the neurotransmitter release\nlocation. To estimate the synaptic current maximal amplitude, we present a\nsemi-analytical model of glutamate diffusing in the synaptic cleft. We modeled\nreceptors as multi-conductance channels and we find that PSD morphological\nchanges can significantly modulate the synaptic current, which is maximally\nreliable (the coefficient of variation is minimal) for an optimal size of the\nPSD, that depends on the vesicular release active zone. The existence of an\noptimal PSD size is related to nonlinear phenomena such as the multi-binding\ncooperativity of the neurotransmitter to the receptors. We conclude that\nchanges in the PSD geometry can sustain a form of synaptic plasticity,\nindependent of a change in the number of receptors.",

        "doi": "10.48550/arXiv.2011.13024",
        "abstract": "Progress in real-time, simultaneous in vivo detection of multiple\nneurotransmitters will help accelerate advances in neuroscience research. The\nneed for development of probes capable of stable electrochemical detection of\nrapid neurotransmitter fluctuations with high sensitivity and selectivity and\nsub-second temporal resolution has, therefore, become compelling. Additionally,\na higher spatial resolution multi-channel capability is required to capture the\ncomplex neurotransmission dynamics across different brain regions. These\nresearch needs have inspired the introduction of glassy carbon (GC)\nmicroelectrode arrays on flexible polymer substrates through carbon MEMS\n(C-MEMS) microfabrication process followed by a novel pattern transfer\ntechnique. These implantable GC microelectrodes offer unique advantages in\nelectrochemical detection of electroactive neurotransmitters through the\npresence of active carboxyl, carbonyl, and hydroxyl functional groups. In\naddition, they offer fast electron transfer kinetics, capacitive\nelectrochemical behavior, and wide electrochemical window. Here, we combine the\nuse of these GC microelectrodes with the fast scan cyclic voltammetry (FSCV)\ntechnique to optimize the co-detection of dopamine and serotonin in vitro and\nin vivo. We demonstrate that using optimized FSCV triangular waveform at scan\nrates lower than 700 V/s and holding and switching at potentials of 0.4 and 1V\nrespectively, it is possible to discriminate voltage reduction and oxidation\npeaks of serotonin and dopamine, with serotonin contributing distinct multiple\noxidation peaks. Taken together, our results present a compelling case for a\ncarbon-based MEA platform rich with active functional groups that allows for\nrepeatable and stable detection of electroactive multiple neurotransmitters at\nconcentrations as low as 10 nM",

        "abstract": "Children with congenital heart disease (CHD) remain at risk for\nneurodevelopmental impairment despite improved peri- and intraoperative care.\nOur prospective cohort study aimed to determine the relationship between\nperioperative brain volumes and neurodevelopmental outcome in neonates with\nsevere CHD. Pre- and postoperative cerebral MRI was acquired in term born\nneonates with CHD undergoing neonatal cardiopulmonary bypass surgery. Brain\nvolumes were measured using an atlas prior based automated method. One-year\noutcome was assessed with the Bayley-III. CHD infants (n=77) had lower pre- and\npostoper-ative total and regional brain volumes compared to controls (n=44, all\np<0.01). CHD infants had poorer cognitive and motor outcome (p<=0.0001) and a\ntrend towards lower language composite score compared to controls (p=0.06). The\ntotal and selected regional postoperative brain volumes predicted cognitive and\nlanguage outcome (all p<0.04). This association was independent of length of\nintensive care unit stay for total, cortical, temporal, frontal and cerebellar\nvolumes. In CHD neonates undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass surgery, pre- and\npostoperative brain volumes are reduced, and postoperative brain volumes\npredict cognitive and language outcome at one year. Reduced cerebral volumes in\nCHD patients could serve as a biomarker for im-paired outcome.",
