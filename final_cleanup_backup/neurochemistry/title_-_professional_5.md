## Abstract

Abstract:
A computational model incorporating insights from quantum theory is proposed to describe and explain synaptic message transmission. We propose that together, neurotransmitters and their corresponding receptors, function as a physical "quantum decision tree" to "decide" whether to excite or inhibit the synapse. When a neurotransmitter binds to its corresponding receptor, it is the equivalent of randomly choosing different "strategies"; a "strategy" has two actions to take: excite or inhibit the synapse with a certain probability. The genetic programming can be applied for learning the observed data sequence to simulate the synaptic message transmission.---
