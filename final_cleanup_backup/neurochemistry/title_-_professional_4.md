## Abstract

Abstract:
We propose a generalization of the neurotransmitter release model proposed in \emph{Rodrigues et al. (PNAS, 2016)}. We increase the complexity of the underlying slow-fast system by considering a degree-four polynomial as parametrization of the critical manifold. We focus on the possible transient and asymptotic dynamics, exploiting the so-called entry-exit function to describe slow parts of the dynamics. We provide extensive numerical simulations, complemented by numerical bifurcation analysis.---
