## Abstract

Neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental disorders represent a significant global health burden, characterized by progressive neuronal dysfunction and loss. Both diseases, despite their diverse etiologies and mechanisms, share a complex interplay of genetic, environmental, and biological factors. Neurodegenerative diseases are caused by multiple factors, including aging, mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, inflammation, genetic mutations, and protein misfolding. In contrast, neurodevelopmental disorders are primarily influenced by epigenetic alterations, neurotransmitter imbalances, early brain damage, environmental factors, and genetic variations. Despite extensive research, effective treatments remain unavailable due to the complexity of their pathologies and the biochemical pathways involved. A deep understanding of the complexities and individual differences associated with these disorders is crucial for developing effective treatments. In this background, this review provides a comprehensive overview of neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental disorders, including their clinical symptoms, etiology, pathogenesis, underlying mechanisms, potential drug targets, reported drugs, advanced treatment options, and challenges in the drug discovery process. This comprehensive literature review was conducted using databases such as PubMed and Scopus, focusing on research published up to April 2025. By understanding the complexities of these disorders, researchers can develop novel therapeutic approaches, including potential drugs and advanced treatment methods, to mitigate their devastating impact.
