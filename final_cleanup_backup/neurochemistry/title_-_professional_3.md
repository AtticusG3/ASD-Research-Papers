## Abstract

Abstract:
Inter neuron communication happens through the exchange of neurotransmitters at the synapse by a process known as exocytosis. This makes exocytosis a fundamental process of information exchange in the body. The exocytosis process has a distinct geometry as it involves a vesicle that attaches to the cell membrane and then releases the neurotransmitters through a pore. Significant recent research, both experimental and numerical, attempt to understand the time dynamics of exocytosis. In this manuscript, we share an analytical model that predicts the key output parameters of exocytosis based on the geometry of the vesicle and pore. Our analytical predictions are well supported by detailed numerical simulations. This model could help extract geometrical parameters from experimental data and hence could be of broad interest.---
