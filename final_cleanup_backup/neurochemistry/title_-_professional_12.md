## Abstract

Previous studies often overlooked the roles of hypoxia and lactate metabolism in the breast cancer (BRCA) microenvironment. This study developed and validated a novel prognostic model for BRCA based on hypoxia-related genes (HRGs) and lactate metabolism-related genes (LMRGs) using machine learning approaches. The aim was to identify molecular subtypes capable of predicting patient prognosis and treatment response, thereby facilitating precision medicine strategies for BRCA.
This study utilized bulk RNA-sequencing data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) BRCA cohort (1,079 tumor samples; 99 normal samples) as the training set, with five independent validation cohorts (GSE19615, GSE20685, GSE20711, GSE42568, GSE58812) retrieved from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. HRGs and LMRGs were identified from the Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB). A machine learning-based integrative approach was employed to construct the Hypoxia and Lactate Metabolism Prognostic Score (HLMPS) via 10-fold cross-validation and multiple algorithm combinations. Model robustness was rigorously assessed through Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, time-dependent receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, and calibration plots with Brier score quantification.
The HLMPS model demonstrated robust prognostic discrimination, with high-risk patients exhibiting significantly inferior overall survival compared to low-risk counterparts [training set areas under the curve (AUCs): 0.76, 0.77, 0.74 at 1/3/5 years; validation sets AUCs: 0.61, 0.65, 0.67 at 1/3/5 years]. Functional enrichment analysis revealed that patients with a high HLMPS tended to have dysregulation of cell cycle and neurodevelopmental pathways, while those with a low HLMPS exhibited activation of immune pathways, including T-cell receptor (TCR) signaling and antigen presentation. An Immune infiltration analysis showed that patients with a low HLMPS had higher levels of immune cell infiltration and better responsiveness to immunotherapy. Meanwhile, patients with a low HLMPS showed greater sensitivity to drugs such as irinotecan and palbociclib, while patients with a high HLMPS were more sensitive to drugs such as lapatinib and sorafenib.
The HLMPS model represents a novel and clinically actionable tool for prognosticating outcomes and therapeutic responses in BRCA patients. This study highlights the potential of precision medicine strategies that integrate HRGs and LMRGs based on tumor microenvironment (TME) features. Future work should focus on validating the HLMPS model in larger, multicenter cohorts and determining its clinical applicability in guiding personalized treatment decisions for patients with BRCA.

• The study extends this approach by examining the activity of hypoxia and lactate metabolic pathways in BRCA and identifying commonalities that could serve as key points for intervention.
What is the implication, and what should change now?
• The risk model developed in this study may serve to better inform the clinical diagnosis of patients with BRCA and related treatment strategies. However, follow-up with clinical samples are needed to determine the clinical value of the model.## IntroductionBreast cancer (BRCA) remains the most life-threatening malignancy among women worldwide (1). Current therapeutic paradigms remain predominantly anchored to pathological subtyping and clinical experience (2). However, due to the highly heterogeneous nature of BRCA tissue-derived cells, therapeutic efficacy often varies greatly between patients (3). In recent years, the proliferation of high-throughput sequencing technologies has provided the technological basis for deciphering the oncological signature of BRCA (4). Consequently, elucidating pivotal molecular drivers and developing novel biomarkers and prognostic models is critical to advancing prevention, diagnostic precision, and targeted therapeutic interventions.
Oxygen homeostasis is critical for the survival and development of tissue cells and even whole organisms (5,6). In solid tumors such as BRCA, persistent hypoxia profoundly shapes the tumor microenvironment (TME) (7). Sustained hypoxic conditions elevate hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) levels within the TME (8). The persistence of a hypoxic environment leads to increased levels of HIF in the TME (9). As a cellular transcription factor, HIF increases the transcription of downstream target genes and plays an important role in the regulation of various biological processes (BPs) such as cell metabolism, proliferation, metastasis, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and angiogenesis (10,11). Recent study has shown that hypoxia and HIF accumulation are associated with poor prognosis and chemotherapy resistance in patients with BRCA (12). Furthermore, hypoxia serves as a predictive biomarker for immunotherapy efficacy; ameliorating hypoxic TME conditions and targeting HIF-1α may enhance tumor sensitivity to immunotherapeutic interventions.
Lactate, an end-product of anaerobic glycolysis (13), accumulates in the TME through hypoxia-mediated metabolic reprogramming. This process—characterized by glycolytic shift, Warburg effect (aerobic glycolysis), and elevated glucose consumption—drives lactate overproduction and subsequent TME acidification (14,15). Lactate accumulation directly regulates the endothelial cell phenotype and drives angiogenesis within the tumor through multiple pathways. As key features of the TME, both hypoxia and lactate can modulate antitumor immune responses (16,17). Several studies have shown that hypoxia and lactate accumulation modulate the function and differentiation of immunosuppressive cells, such as myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), and regulatory T cells (Tregs), thereby promoting immunosuppression and tumor immune escape (18,19). The hypoxic environment and high accumulation of lactate stimulate TAM polarization to an M2 phenotype and increase the specific overexpression of dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD), leading to chemoresistance. Lactate also decreases the production of interferon gamma (IFN-γ) by CD8+ T cells and natural killer (NK) cells, thereby inhibiting their cytotoxic function (20). In addition, hypoxia activates the HIF-1α signaling pathway leading to the upregulation of programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1), while lactate increases the expression of programmed cell death receptor-1 (PD-1) in Tregs, leading to the failure of immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy (21,22).
Despite advances in understanding BRCA heterogeneity, the complex interplay between hypoxia and lactate metabolism remains incompletely elucidated. Therefore, there is a need for a landscape assessment of the combined effect of hypoxia and lactate metabolism on BRCA prognosis, TME, and immunotherapy. To address this, we established a novel BRCA subtype classification framework integrating hypoxia-related genes (HRGs) and lactate metabolism-related genes (LMRGs). These molecular subtypes were systematically profiled across multidimensional parameters. Collectively, this study aims to leverage this classification paradigm to develop precision treatment strategies for BRCA, ultimately enhancing patient outcomes. We present this article in accordance with the TRIPOD reporting checklist (available at https://tcr.amegroups.com/article/view/10.21037/tcr-2025-1115/rc).## Bulk RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) data acquisition and preprocessingTranscriptomic profiles and corresponding clinical data for BRCA were sourced from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) (https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/) database. To establish cohort homogeneity, samples with incomplete survival records were excluded, while those with a minimum post-diagnosis follow-up duration of 30 days were retained. The final analytical cohort comprised 1,079 tumor specimens and 99 adjacent normal tissues. Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) datasets (accession numbers: GSE19615, GSE20685, GSE20711, GSE42568, GSE58812) served as the external validation cohorts, with associated RNA-seq data and clinical metadata being retrieved (23-27). Probe-level expression data were consolidated via through the selection of probes demonstrating maximum mean expression values per gene symbol, which avoided potential conflicts arising from duplicate gene annotations.
HRGs and LMRGs were obtained from the Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB). A comprehensive gene list is provided in table available at https://cdn.amegroups.cn/static/public/tcr-2025-1115-1.xlsx. The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and its subsequent amendments.## Differential gene expressionDifferential gene expression analysis was conducted using the “DESeq2” R package, with the following statistical significance thresholds being applied: |log2(fold change)| >1 and a Benjamini-Hochberg-adjusted P value <0.05 (28).## Integrative approach-derived hypoxia- and lactate metabolism-related prognostic signature based on machine learningWe constructed a stable hypoxia- and lactate metabolism-related prognostic signature by using TCGA-BRCA data as a training set and five BRCA GEO datasets as a validation set. In order to develop a highly accurate and stable HLMPS, the gene expression profiles in all datasets were converted to z-scores and any batch effects were eliminated via the “combat” R package. The signature was generated as follows: (I) differential genes between tumor and adjacent paracancerous tissues were intersected with HRGs and LMRGs using univariate Cox regression analysis, identifying 11 intersecting genes as key hypoxia-lactate metabolism regulators in BRCA; (II) integrating 10 machine learning algorithms, 101 algorithm combinations were generated through random pairing and evaluated via 10-fold cross-validation; (III) all combinations were implemented across the TCGA-BRCA cohort and independent validation sets, with optimal features selected by maximizing the mean concordance index (C-index) across cohorts.## Validation and prognostic evaluationKaplan-Meier survival analysis was performed to compare the overall survival outcomes between high- and low-risk subgroups, dichotomized at the median risk score. The prognostic discrimination capacity of the risk model was quantified through time-dependent ROC analysis via the “timeROC” R package, with the area under the curve (AUC) values calculated for 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival probabilities (29). A multivariate prognostic nomogram incorporating the risk score and clinicopathological variables was constructed via the “rms” package. Model calibration was assessed using Brier scores and calibration plots, while clinical utility was evaluated through decision curve analysis (DCA) (30).## Functional annotation analysisGene Ontology (GO) BPs and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways were systematically interrogated using the “clusterProfiler” R package (31). In addition, gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) and gene set variation analysis (GSVA) (32) were implemented to identify differentially activated pathways between the prognostic subgroups, with reference to the hallmark gene sets from MSigDB (33-35).## TME characterizationThe Estimation of Stromal and Immune cells in Malignant Tumor Tissues Using Expression Data (ESTIMATE) algorithm was applied to compute immune, stromal, and ESTIMATE scores and tumor purity (36). Immune cell infiltration patterns were deconvoluted using Tumor Immune Estimation Resource 2.0 (TIMER2.0; http://timer.cistrome.org), while the Tumor Immune Dysfunction and Exclusion (TIDE) platform was used to predict immunotherapy responsiveness through transcriptomic signatures of T-cell dysfunction or exclusion.## Therapeutic sensitivity profilingIn silico chemotherapeutic response prediction was performed using “oncoPredict” R package, with the half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) values being calculated through ridge regression models trained on Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer (GDSC) datasets (37).## Statistical analysisAll analyses were conducted in R v. 4.2.0 (The R Foundation for Statistical Computing). Continuous variables were compared with the two-tailed Wilcoxon rank-sum test. Categorical data analysis was conducted via the Fisher exact test. Bivariate correlations were assessed via the Pearson correlation coefficient. Survival disparities were evaluated through log-rank tests with Kaplan-Meier estimators. A Benjamini-Hochberg-adjusted P value <0.05 was considered to indicate statistical significance unless otherwise specified.## Combination of 10 machine learning methods for building the HLMPSTo identify stable and important genes related to hypoxia and lactate metabolism, we first performed differentially expressed gene (DEG) analysis on BRCA tissues and adjacent paracancerous tissues. We identified 3,327 downregulated and 4,542 upregulated genes (Figure 1A). In addition, we identified 1,821 genes associated with the overall survival expectation of patients with BRCA (Figure 1B). Combining the genes related to hypoxia and lactate metabolism with with DEG and genes associated with the overall survival, a total of 11 genes differentially expressed in BRCA and associated with survival prognosis were identified (Figure 1B,1C). In order to obtain a stable and robust hypoxia and lactate metabolism model, we constructed a combination of 101 algorithms by combining 10 machine learning algorithms, including StepcCox, Ridge, random survival forest, and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) among others. The TCGA-BRCA dataset was used for the training set, and the validation set consisted of five independent BRCA GEO datasets comprising a total of 500 patients and complete clinical data. The C-index of the 101 algorithm combinations was calculated in the training and validation sets, and it was found that the StepCox (forward) + Ridge combination had the best practical application (Figure 1D and Figure S1). We named the score obtained by the StepCox (forward) + Ridge combination method the HLMPS.

Patients with BRCA were categorized into high- and low-expression groups based on the median HLMPS. We found that the expected overall survival of patients with a high HLMPS was much worse than that of patients with a low HLMPS. The 1-, 3-, and 5-year AUC values for HLMPS among the participants in the training set were 0.76, 0.77, and 0.74, respectively, while they were 0.61, 0.65, and 0.67, respectively, in the validation set (Figure 1E-1J). In addition, we compared the patients’ disease-specific survival (DSS), disease-free survival (DFS), and progression-free survival (PFS) between the patients with a high and low HLMPS. We found that patients with a high HLMPS had a poorer prognosis in terms of all of these metrics (Figure 1K-1P). In summary, a novel signature for predicting the prognosis of patients with BRCA was developed and validated.## Prognostic analysis based on clinical and pathological stagingWe compared the differences in HLMPS between different clinical stages and molecular subtypes. We found that the HLMPS increased progressively with increasing tumor stage, with stage IV having the highest HLMPS (Figure 2A). In terms of molecular subtypes, the HLMPS also varied, with the Her2 type being associated with the highest HLMPS and the normal type with the lowest score (Figure 2B). In addition, for tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) classification, higher stage implied higher HLMPS (Figure 2C-2E). The clinical management of BRCA primarily relies on clinicopathological staging systems. However, significant prognostic heterogeneity persists within stage-matched cohorts, and so we stratified survival analysis across disease stages. The prognostic model based on HLMPS demonstrated robust discriminative capacity in the stage II (P<0.001) and III (P=0.009) cohorts, with a higher HLMPS correlating with adverse clinical outcomes (Figure 2F-2I). Notably, this stratification potential diminished in the stage I and IV populations, a phenomenon potentially attributable to the limited sample sizes in these subgroups (particularly stage IV) coupled with the enhanced early detection rates in modern screening paradigms.

Molecular subtype-specific analysis revealed the prognostic utility of the HLMPS across non-HER2 subtypes (Luminal a, Luminal b, and Basal-like). A higher HLMPS consistently predicted poorer survival (Luminal B: P<0.001; Luminal A: P<0.001; Basal-like: P=0.006), with particularly pronounced stratification in the hormone receptor–positive subtypes (Figure 2J-2M). Notably, HER2-enriched subtypes showed no significant HLMPS-survival association (P=0.26), suggesting subtype-specific biological relevance.## Functional and genomic features of patients with high and low HLMPSWe further performed DEG analysis between the high-HLMPS and low-HLMPS patient groups (Figure 3A). GO BPs enrichment analyses of the upregulated genes in the high-HLMPS group revealed involvement in various neural development and synaptic signaling pathways, including modulation of chemical synaptic transmission, neurotransmitter transport, and axon guidance (Figure 3B). Conversely, the upregulated genes in the low-HLMPS group were associated with Th1- and Th2-cell differentiation, the T-cell receptor (TCR) signaling pathway, and PD-L1 and PD-1 checkpoint (Figure 3C). Additionally, GSEA of 50 hallmark genes revealed that the E2F targets, G2M checkpoint, and glycolysis were elevated in patients with a high HLMPS, while allograft rejection, interferon response, and inflammatory response were highly enriched in patients with a low HLMPS (Figure 3D). Accordingly, we hypothesized that the high-HLMPS group is typically characterized by uncontrolled growth of tumor tissue due to cell cycle disruption, which may be associated with patients’ poor survival prognosis. The low-HLMPS group can be characterized by activation of the immune system, including T cells, NK cells, and related signaling pathways and receptors. We further sought to confirm this speculation. We found the activation of cell cycle, DNA replication, and mismatch repair in KEGG pathway in the high-HLMPS group, and activation of CD22-mediated B-cell receptor (BCR) regulation, initial triggering of complement, and PD1 signaling in the reactome pathway in the low-HLMPS group (Figure 3E,3F). This may explain the difference in clinical prognosis found across patients with a high and low HLMPS. By calculating the signature scores of 16 recurrent cancer cell states using the GSVA algorithm, we found that the basal, interferon, and stress gene modules were significantly more highly expressed in the low-HLMPS group than in the high-HLMPS group (Figure 3G). Moreover, we compared the mutation features between BRCA patients with high and low HLMPS and found a higher mutation frequency of TP53 and KMT2C but a lower mutation frequency of CDH1 in the high-risk group (Figure 4A). Finally, by calculating the tumor mutation burden (TMB) for each patient with BRCA, we observed a slightly higher level of TMB in the high-HLMPS group, with TMB being significantly and positively correlated with HLMPS (Figure 4B,4C). In addition, patients with a higher HLMPS showed high loading in terms of aneuploidy, MSIsensor score, mutation count, and frequency (Figure 4D-4G). Overall, these findings highlight the distinct functional and genomic features between BRCA patients with a high HLMPS and a low HLMPS.

To systematically characterize TIME heterogeneity across the HLMPS-stratified cohorts, we implemented multimodal immune profiling. The ESTIMATE algorithm indicated progressive elevation of TME scores with increasing HLMPS (stromal/immune/ESTIMATE scores: r=0.32–0.41; all P values <0.001; Figure 5A, Figure S2A-S2D). CIBERSORT-ABS deconvolution further clarified the differential leukocyte infiltration patterns: compared to those with a high HLMPS, patients with a low HLMPS exhibited enriched infiltration of memory CD4+ T cells (1.8 folds; P=0.003), cytotoxic CD8+ T cells (2.1 folds; P=0.001), M1-polarized macrophages (1.5 folds; P=0.02), and Tregs (1.7 folds; P=0.01) (Figures 5B, Figure S2E-S2H). Additional immune cell deconvolution algorithms further validated the aforementioned viewpoints (Figure S2I-S2K). These populations showed significant inverse correlations with HLMPS (memory CD4+: r=–0.24; CD8+: r=–0.39; M1 macrophages: r=–0.3; Treg: r=–0.18; all P values <0.01; Figure S2E-S2H). Notably, HLMPS demonstrated broad negative associations with immune checkpoint expression (PD-1: r=–0.29; CTLA-4: r=–0.33; LAG-3: r=–0.27; all P values <0.005; Figure 5C,5D). Given this immunological variability, TIDE analysis predicted enhanced immunotherapy responsiveness in patients with a low HLMPS, as evidenced by lower T-cell exclusion scores (Δ=1.8; P=0.004) and elevated responder proportions (68.2% vs. 41.7%; P<0.001; Figure 5E-5G). These findings collectively position low-HLMPS tumors within an immunologically active niche, potentially conferring superior immunotherapy benefit relative to their high-HLMPS counterparts.

To delineate the pharmacogenomic relationships between the HLMPS, candidate genes, and drug response, we calculated the IC50 values across the training cohort samples. Comprehensive pharmacogenomic analysis revealed significant associations: HLMPS showed positive correlations with higher IC50 values for topoisomerase inhibitors (irinotecan: r=0.38, P=0.002; mitoxantrone: r=0.42, P<0.001; topotecan: r=0.35, P=0.005), indicating reduced efficacy); meanwhile, HLMPS was inversely correlated with experimental agents BI.2536 (r=–0.41; P=0.001) and SB505124 (r=–0.37; P=0.003), suggesting enhanced potency) (Figure 6A). After stratification according to an HLMPS threshold, low-risk patients exhibited increased sensitivity to irinotecan (P=0.007) and CDK4/6 inhibitor palbociclib (P=0.002) (Figure 6B-6E). Conversely, high-HLMPS tumors demonstrated preferential vulnerability to multikinase inhibitors lapatinib (P<0.001) and sorafenib (P=0.004) (Figure 6F-6I). These different sensitivity profiles support HLMPS’s utility to guide personalized therapeutic strategies.

To operationalize these findings, we constructed a composite nomogram integrating HLMPS with key clinical variables, enabling individual prediction of the 1-, 3-, and 5-year overall survival probabilities (C-index =0.72; Figure 7B). Internal validation through calibration plots demonstrated strong concordance between nomogram-predicted and observed survival outcomes across all timepoints (1 year: slope =0.94, P=0.12; 3 years: slope =0.89, P=0.08; 5 years slope =0.91, P=0.09; Figure 7C-7E). DCA revealed a superior net benefit across clinically relevant threshold probabilities (15–60%) with comparison to conventional TNM staging and age-based stratification (Figure 7F). These results collectively establish the clinical utility of this integrative prognostic tool for personalized survival prediction in BRCA management.

However, the overall survival rate of patients at the advanced stage or with certain subtypes, especially triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), remains unsatisfactory (38). Studies based on molecular biology and high-throughput sequencing technologies have provided further insights into the TME within BRCA tissues, and the high degree of heterogeneity in molecular origins of BRCAs means that the same treatment can have a variety of effects in different patients or even at different times in the same patient. Combining ICI therapy with traditional treatments may significantly improve the survival of certain patients with BRCA (39-41). Conventional clinicopathological staging demonstrates limited utility for risk stratification and prognostic management. While recent advances in biomarker mutation profiling have enhanced precision in guiding ICI regimens (42), substantial costs, limited scalability, and restricted applicability constrain clinical implementation. A large-scale real-world validation study remains imperative to establish circulating tumor DNA-based liquid biopsy protocols for therapeutic guidance (43). The maturation of tissue sample sequencing technologies has provided a better characterization of tumor biology. However, evaluation at the algorithmic level is still inconsistent, and the determination of the best algorithm requires thorough consideration. In addition, the impact on researchers’ personal preferences cannot be ignored. These uncertainties suggest that the established features are not yet sufficiently convincing in their ability to predict patient prognosis and guiding clinical precision. To address this, we developed a systematic framework integrating 10 machine learning algorithms through iterative pairwise modeling, establishing novel prognostic biomarkers with robust clinical validity.
A hypoxic TME and HIF-dependent cancer hallmarks of angiogenesis and metabolic reorganization are well-recognized drivers of BRCA aggressiveness, treatment resistance, immune escape, and poor prognosis (44). Classical HIF regulatory mechanisms such as angiogenesis inducers [e.g., vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)], angiogenesis receptors [e.g., VEGFR and angiopoietin (ANGPT) receptor] with cell adhesion and extracellular matrix remodeling components play important roles in BRCA angiogenesis. In TNBC models, hypoxia induces immunosuppressive gene expression, driving dysfunction in tumor-killing cells (e.g., T cells, NK cells) and conferring immunotherapy resistance (45,46). Lactate is a product of glycolysis and the Warburg effect in tumor cells under hypoxic conditions. Lactate has an important role as a proinflammatory and immunosuppressive mediator. Studies have shown that ectopic Zeb1-expressing BRCA cells produce lactate in an acidic tumor environment, which induces selective activation of the M2-type macrophage phenotype through stimulation of the PKA/CREB signaling pathway and is thought to have both tumor growth-promoting and immunosuppressive functions (9,43). Hypoxia and lactate accumulation are two important features of the TME. Despite these significant findings, comprehensive assessment of hypoxia and lactate metabolism clinical applications in large BRCA cohorts remains limited. Further investigation is imperative to elucidate their complex role in BRCA progression, particularly regarding impacts on therapeutic and immunotherapy efficacy. In this study, we used a combination of 101 machine learning algorithms and created and evaluated an optimal, robust risk scoring model to predict prognosis and treatment response in BRCA.
First, we established DEGs between tumor and paracancerous tissues and HRGs and LMRGs with prognostic benefit. The intersecting genes between the two were considered to be important HRGs and LMRGs and included SLC5A12, TPD52, and PSME2, among others. Based on this portion of genes, 10 different machine learning algorithms were randomly combined via 10-fold cross-validation to generate 101 combinations of algorithms. Subsequently, the optimal algorithm was identified, and the HLMPS was constructed. Based on the median HLMPS, we divided the patients into two groups, which exhibited significant differences in terms of survival expectancy, biological function, mutation profiles, TIME, and immunotherapy and chemotherapy sensitivity. Specifically, patients with high HLMPS had a worse overall survival, DSS, DFS, and PFS. Furthermore, to validate the stability of HLMPS, we integrated multiple BRCA cohorts and referred to survival information. Similar results were found for HLMPS in the validation cohort. In addition, we developed a column-line plot using HLMPS and clinical parameters, which indicated significant clinical predictive value for BRCA. These findings confirmed the good predictive validity and stable clinical value of the HLMPS.
Using pathway enrichment analysis, we found significant activation of cell cycle and neurodevelopmental elements in the high-HLMPS group. GSEA showed enrichment of E2F targets, G2M checkpoint and mitotic spindle, modulation of chemical synaptic transmission, and regulation of synaptic plasticity in BP. Meanwhile, in the low-HLMPS group, there was a greater tendency for activation of immune pathways including TCR, BCR, and antigen presentation processes. In addition, patients with a high HLMPS also show a strong association with cell cycle processes, disruption of normal cellular mitotic processes, abnormal DNA copying, and uncontrolled tissue growth (47). In patients with a high HLMPS, the activity of gene modules related to the recurrent cancer cell state cycle was significantly elevated. Our findings highlight the important link between high and low HLMPS as a functional difference.
The pivotal role of the TIME in cancer evolution and progression is well-established, with emerging consensus that mechanistic elucidation may enable development of more precise and effective immunotherapies (48). In our study, we found that patients with a high HLMPS exhibited low levels of immune cell infiltration and immune-related pathway inhibition. However, those with a low HLMPS also exhibited significant high expressions of immunosuppressive checkpoints such as CD274, PDCD1, CTLA4, and LAG3 and showed enrichment of the PD-L1/PD-1 checkpoint pathway in tumors. In addition to the depletion of T cells in patients with a high and low HLMPS, we observed a lower abundance of immunosuppressive M1-like macrophages (49,50). Therefore, we identified the high-HLMPS subpopulation as an immunosuppressive subtype, which was further validated by the TIDE algorithm. TIDE is a computational method for predicting the efficacy of immunotherapy, with higher TIDE scores indicating a reduced therapeutic benefit and an increased likelihood of immune evasion (51). The low-HLMPS group exhibited significantly lower exclusion and high dysfunction scores and improved responsiveness to immunotherapy. Our study characterized the diversity of the TIME in BRCA and identified different molecular subtypes that exhibit differential sensitivity to immunotherapy. Consequently, the HLMPS classification system may facilitate tailored immunotherapy strategies, complementing existing biomarkers for patient stratification. Furthermore, we assessed correlations between HLMPS levels, signature gene expression, and IC50 of common chemotherapeutic agents. These results could provide important insights into combination therapy or the selection of patients with BRCA who are more sensitive to certain chemotherapeutic agents.
Despite the innovative framework integrating hypoxia-lactate metabolism for molecular classification and the robust prognostic performance of our model, several limitations warrant consideration. First, the translational implementation of hypoxia-lactate-based classification and prognostic modeling presents operational challenges in clinical translation. This necessitates development of streamlined protocols, standardized analytical pipelines, and multidisciplinary collaboration to enhance clinical utility. Second, the retrospective study design introduces inherent selection bias in BRCA patient recruitment. Validation through prospective multicenter randomized controlled trials—incorporating rigorous methodologies, large-scale cohorts, and longitudinal follow-up—is required to confirm these findings.## ConclusionsIn summary, our study delineates two distinct extracellular clusters in BRCA patients, characterized by significant differences in survival rates, immune cell infiltration, and multiple clinical/molecular variables. High-risk patients exhibited shorter survival durations, dysregulated cell cycle pathways, and sensitivity to drugs such as lapatinib, whereas low-risk patients demonstrated immune pathway activation, enhanced immune infiltration, and responsiveness to immunotherapy and agents like irinotecan. This molecular stratification and prognostic signature, driven by HRGs and LMRGs, not only serves as a robust metric for tumor progression but also represents a valuable tool for developing personalized clinical strategies. It is particularly relevant to the field of BRCA immunotherapy, where personalized therapeutic approaches are critical.## FootnoteReporting Checklist: The authors have completed the TRIPOD reporting checklist.
