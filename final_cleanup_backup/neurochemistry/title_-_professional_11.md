## Abstract

Abstract:
In nanopore technology, the development of multiplexed detection and release platforms with high spatial and temporal resolution remains a significant challenge due to the difficulty in distinguishing signals originating from different nanopores in a single chip. In this work, we present a solid-state nanopore system functionalized with molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) for the selective detection and controlled release of neurotransmitters. We designed a nanopore array where each nanopore is functionalized with a specific MIP able to recognize specific neurotransmitters (dopamine, gamma-aminobutyric acid, and histamine, respectively). The platform demonstrated high performance in terms of sensitivity, selectivity, recovery, and stability. Multiplexed detection with high spatiotemporal resolution of the order of 100 ms/ 3 {\mu}m was achieved by specifically depositing MIPs and conductive hydrogels on different nanopores prepared on a single solid-state membrane. The employment of micro-chambers for each nanopore prevented signal cross-talk, thereby enabling simultaneous detection and release of multiple neurotransmitters. Moreover, we demonstrated computing with different logic gates and in-edge computing. This nanopore platform represents a radically novel approach towards hybrid solid-state nanopores able to perform real-time label-free multiplex detection, controlled biomolecule release, and ionic logic computing, addressing key challenges in neurochemical sensing and bio-computation.---
