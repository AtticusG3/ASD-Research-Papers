## Abstract

Clinical studies have identiﬁed multiple mitochondrial disturbances in the peripheral tissues of patients with autism. However, how neuronal metabolism contributes to the autism-associated phenotype remains unclear. In this study, we focused on the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and reported hydrogen sulfide (H
