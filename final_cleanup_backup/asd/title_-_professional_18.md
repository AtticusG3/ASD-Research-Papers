## Abstract

Abstract:
Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is one of the most significant neurological disorders that disrupt a person's social communication skills. The progression and development of neuroimaging technologies has made structural network construction of brain regions possible. In this paper, after finding the discriminative sub-network using the evolutionary algorithm, the simple features of the sub-network lead us to diagnose autism in various subjects with plausible accuracy (76% on average). This method yields substantially better results compared to previous researches. Thus, this method may be used as an accurate assistance in autism screening---
