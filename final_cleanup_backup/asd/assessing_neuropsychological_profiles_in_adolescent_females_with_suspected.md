## Abstract

This study evaluates the neuropsychological profiles of three adolescent females with suspected Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). The study was conducted at My Blue Side, a support organization in Southern Tenerife. The research included a detailed assessment using standardized neuropsychological tests to identify the neuropsychological characteristics associated with ASD in adolescent females. The primary objective was to delineate the neuropsychological profile of each participant and its relationship with their daily functioning. Three participants underwent a comprehensive neuropsychological assessment incorporating the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised (ADI-R), the Autonomous Scale for the Detection of Asperger Syndrome and High-Functioning Autism, the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC-V), the D2 test, Five-Digit Test (FDT), Spain-Complutense Verbal Learning Test (TAVCI), Rey Complex Figure (RCF) and Executive Functioning Questionnaire (EFECO). The study design aimed to provide a thorough understanding of each participant's neuropsychological profile and its potential impact on their daily functioning. The results indicated significant ASD markers across the participants, with substantial variability in neuropsychological capabilities, particularly in working memory and executive functioning. These deficits impacted daily functioning and emotional regulation. The assessments also highlighted challenges in verbal and visual learning, as well as difficulties with spontaneous recall. These findings underscore the need for interventions to consider these neuropsychological characteristics and their relationship with the daily challenges faced by females with ASD and their families, beyond the core symptoms of the disorder.
