## Abstract

Neurodevelopmental disorders, particularly autism spectrum disorder (ASD), are increasingly linked to prenatal exposure to environmental heavy metal mixtures. This study aimed to evaluate the neurodevelopmental risks of such mixtures by integrating human cohort data, zebrafish behavioral assays, and omics analyses, thereby advancing mechanistic and mixture-based risk assessment frameworks. We applied a multi-level design: (i) a prospective population-based cohort (Shanghai Birth Cohort, n = 941) assessing prenatal exposure to lead (Pb), cadmium (Cd), mercury (Hg), and arsenic (As) measured in cord blood, with neurodevelopmental outcomes evaluated at ages 2 and 4; (ii) embryonic zebrafish models (0-5 dpf) exposed to a human-relevant mixture (Mix N) to assess locomotor and social behaviors, as well as dose-response relationships; (iii) zebrafish transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses to uncover molecular mechanisms, with emphasis on lipid and steroid metabolism; and (iv) the Similar Mixture Approach (SMACH) integrating evidence across species for risk assessment. Mean cord blood concentrations of Pb, Cd, Hg, and As were 13.560, 0.051, 2.237, and 2.478 Î¼g/L, respectively. Prenatal exposure to the mixture significantly impaired motor and social functions, with Pb contributing most to motor deficits and Cd to social dysfunction. Zebrafish assays confirmed dose-dependent decreases in locomotor activity and social preference. Integrated omics analyses identified substantial disruption of lipid and steroid metabolic pathways, particularly involving the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) signaling cascade. SMACH-based risk estimation suggested that over 51.7% of children in the cohort may have experienced prenatal exposure levels associated with measurable neurodevelopmental risk. Prenatal exposure to heavy metal mixtures may compromise early neurodevelopment via PPAR-mediated lipid metabolic dysregulation. These findings provide mechanistic evidence, highlight the vulnerability of early life to combined exposures, and support translational, mixture-informed frameworks for risk assessment and prevention.
