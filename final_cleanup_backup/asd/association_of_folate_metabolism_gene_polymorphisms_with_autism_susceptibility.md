## Abstract

Folate metabolism gene polymorphisms may play an important role in the pathogenesis of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). However, most studies have primarily used single candidate gene typing strategies (such as targeted polymerase chain reaction technology), and current findings remain inconsistent. To investigate the association of folate metabolism gene polymorphisms with ASD susceptibility and symptom severity among Chinese children. Whole-exome sequencing (WES) was conducted to systematically screen for coding region variants of key genes in the folate metabolism pathway among children with ASD, focusing on identifying polymorphisms with high mutation frequencies and potential pathogenic effects. A case-control study was then conducted to explore the association of candidate folate metabolism gene polymorphisms with the susceptibility and severity of ASD. WES was performed on 70 children with ASD, and the case-control study included 170 children with ASD and 170 healthy controls. WES revealed that 84.3% (59/70) of children with ASD carried potentially pathogenic variants enriched in folate metabolism pathways. Most children with ASD carry deleterious variants in folate metabolism-related pathways.
