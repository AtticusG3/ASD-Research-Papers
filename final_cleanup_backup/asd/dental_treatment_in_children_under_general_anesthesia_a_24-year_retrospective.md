## Abstract

General anesthesia (GA) is frequently used for pediatric dental treatment in cases of extensive decay, behavioral challenges, or medical conditions that prevent conventional care. This study presents a 24-year retrospective analysis of dental treatments performed under GA at the Children's Hospital. A retrospective review was conducted on dental treatments performed under GA between January 1, 2001, and December 31, 2024. Data collection included patient age, sex, details on dental procedures, medical status, and postoperative follow-up. Statistical analyses included linear regression, Pearson's correlation, Mann-Kendall trend test, Student's Between 2001 and 2024, 4,062 patients underwent dental treatment under GA, representing 1.59% of all admissions. The proportion of treatments under GA increased significantly ( The demand for dental treatment under GA has significantly increased over the past 24 years. While GA remains a crucial option for pediatric patients with extensive dental needs or special conditions, the low postoperative follow-up rates highlight the need for improved follow-up strategies.
