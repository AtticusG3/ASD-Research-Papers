## Abstract

(1) Background: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is caused from rapid head acceleration/deceleration, focal blows, blasts, penetrating forces, and/or shearing forces, whereas hypoxic-anoxic injury (HAI) is caused through oxygen deprivation events, including strangulation. Most service-seeking domestic violence (DV) survivors have prior mechanistic exposures that can lead to both injuries. At the time of our study, some evidence existed about the exposure to both injuries over the course of a survivor's lifetime from abuse sources, yet little was known about their co-occurrence to the same survivor within the same episode of physical intimate partner violence (IPV). To better understand the lived experience of service-seeking DV survivors and the context in which partner-inflicted brain injury (PIBI) is sustained, we sought to understand intentional brain injury (BI) exposures that may need to be addressed and accommodated in services. Our aims were to 1. characterize the lifetime co-occurrence of strangulation and intentional head trauma exposures from all abuse sources to the same survivor and within select physical episodes of IPV and 2. establish the lifetime prevalence of PIBI. (2) Methods: Survivors seeking DV services in the state of Ohio in the United States of America (U.S.) completed interview-administered surveys in 2019 (
