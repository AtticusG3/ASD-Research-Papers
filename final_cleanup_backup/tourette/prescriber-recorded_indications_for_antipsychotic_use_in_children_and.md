## Abstract

The use of antipsychotics (APs) in children and adolescents has increased notably worldwide, often beyond approved indications. However, most real-world studies lack direct information on the clinical reasons for prescribing. In this population-based study conducted in the region of Valencia, Spain, we analysed 128,057 AP treatments, comprising 741,213 prescriptions, issued to 30,383 individuals aged 0-19 years between 2015 and 2023, using real-world data that uniquely includes prescriber-recorded indications. We described the distribution and temporal evolution of the number of AP treatments by indication, age, sex, and active substance. The most frequent indications were disorders of personality and behaviour (20.2% of treatments), attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (14.2%), autism spectrum disorders (13.9%), anxiety-related disorders (11.4%), and psychotic disorders (5.8%). Among the most frequent indications, depression treatments showed the steepest increase (5.7-fold). Sharp rises also were observed for suicidal ideation (30.7-fold), psychoactive drug use (2.8-fold), eating disorders (2.3-fold), and autism-related conditions (2.2-fold). Changes were more pronounced in females and older adolescents, particularly after 2020. The number of ADHD treatments declined substantially over time. Sulpiride was almost exclusively prescribed for dizziness, a non-psychiatric but approved indication in adults in Spain. Our findings align with international trends but provide greater specificity thanks to the direct link between prescriptions and indications. This study highlights an increase in the volume of AP treatments in paediatric populations, mostly in non-approved, and potentially high-risk indications, some of which have not been previously documented. Our results underscore the need for close monitoring and further evaluation of the appropriateness and safety of antipsychotic prescription in the youth.

International evidence consistently shows that APs are frequently used to manage a wide range of behavioural and emotional symptoms associated with conditions such as attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), conduct disorder, anxiety, and depression [1,2,3,4,5,6]. In Europe, only a few APs are approved for children and adolescents, typically within restricted age ranges and primarily for the treatment of schizophrenia, psychotic symptoms, severe manic episodes in bipolar-I disorder, or irritability associated with autistic disorder or compromised intellectual capacity [7,8,9,10], and off-label prescribing remains highly prevalent across healthcare systems [11,12,13,14,15,16,17]. Importantly, due to the persistent lack of paediatric data and limited research in this population, not only child and adolescent psychiatrists but also general paediatricians are often required—or effectively forced—to prescribe APs off-label.Notably, most real-world studies aiming to identify the clinical indications for AP prescribing face a critical and persistent limitation: the lack of direct access to the prescriber’s intended indication at the time of prescription. Across real-world data sources, prescriptions are not directly linked to specific diagnoses, meaning the exact reason for prescribing a medication cannot be unequivocally determined. To address this limitation, various indirect methods have been employed, such as inferring indications from diagnostic codes in medical claims or administrative databases, often relying on proxies like the temporal proximity of diagnosis to prescription, hierarchical classification algorithms, or clinician audits [1,2,3,4,5,6,11,12,13,14,15,16,17]. While informative, these approaches suffer from important limitations, including small sample sizes and non-representative populations, as well as a risk of misclassification errors, arising from incomplete or inconsistent diagnostic documentation, or from cases where the true indication does not align with the closest or most “logical” diagnosis in the record, a situation that appears to be particularly common in the case of AP prescribing in youth. Moreover, these studies provide an overall snapshot of indications at a single time point or cumulatively over a period, but they are intrinsically limited in their ability to describe how the frequency of indications evolves over time.In Spain, the Valencia Health System Integrated Database (VID) provides direct access to the specific indication for prescription for each treatment issued in the region to its 5 million inhabitants. Using VID data, the aim of this study is to describe the primary indications for which AP are prescribed to children and adolescents in the region of Valencia, and to describe the evolution of the number of treatments per indications over time during the 2015–2023 period.MethodsDesign, setting and populationPopulation-based, cross-sectional study conducted in the region of Valencia, Spain, specifically within the population covered by the public Valencia Health System (VHS), which serves approximately 97% of the region’s five million residents—including around one million individuals aged 0 to 19 years old. We included all AP treatments prescribed to patients in this age range between January 1, 2015, and December 31, 2023. All APs classified under code N05A of the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) classification system, and prescribed at least once during the study period, were included. APs were categorized by their international non-proprietary names.Data sourcesData were obtained from VID, which is the result of the linkage, by means of a single personal identification number, of a set of publicly owned, population-based healthcare, clinical and administrative electronic databases in Valencia, which has provided comprehensive information for the region’s five million inhabitants since 2008. VID includes sociodemographic and administrative data (e.g., sex, age, nationality) as well as healthcare information such as diagnoses, procedures, laboratory data, pharmaceutical treatments and dispensing (including brand and generic name, formulation, strength, indication for prescription and dosing schedule/regimen), hospitalizations, mortality, healthcare utilization and public health data. VID also includes a set of specific associated databases with population-wide information on significant care areas such as cancer, rare disease, vaccines and imaging data [18].Ascertainment and classification of the reason for prescriptionPharmaceutical treatments in VID can be established for up to 12 months and may be extended beyond that period, and may contain a variable number of prescriptions. Each treatment may consist of multiple prescriptions, typically dispensed monthly or at shorter intervals (e.g., a 6-month treatment for schizophrenia may include six 30-day prescriptions). When initiating a treatment, prescribers are required to specify a diagnosis as the reason for prescribing, using either the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM), or the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Spanish Version (ICD-10-ES). To enable joint analysis of diagnoses recorded under both coding systems, we extracted all diagnostic codes linked to all AP treatments prescribed during the study period and grouped them using the official ICD9-ICD10 mapping tool provided by the Spanish Ministry of Health [19], supplemented by clinical judgment. This process resulted in a classification scheme comprising 22 distinct indications for antipsychotic prescription in children and adolescents using ICD terminology (see Supplementary MaterialS1).Other variablesAge and sex assigned at birth were used for descriptive analyses and stratification. Age was categorized into four groups: 0–4, 5–9, 10–14, and 15–19 years. These categories were applied on a yearly basis, allowing individuals to transition between age groups over the follow-up period. In addition, we analysed changes in indications for the AP drugs of greatest interest, defined as those with the highest relative prescription volume in 2023: risperidone, aripiprazole, olanzapine, paliperidone, quetiapine, sulpiride and lurasidone (see Supplementary MaterialS2).Analysis.We conducted a descriptive analysis of the most prescribed indications for AP use, both annually and for the entire study period. First, we ranked indications based on the total number of treatments in the period, overall and for the APs of interest, as well as stratified by age and sex group. The top 10 indications in terms of the total numbers of treatment were summarized for each subgroup. Second, we described the yearly distribution of indications, overall and within relevant subgroups, and we depicted graphically the evolution of the total number of treatments for the top 10 indications, in the overall population and in stratified analyses.ResultsA total of 128,057 AP treatments, comprising 741,213 prescriptions, were prescribed to 30,383 distinct individuals aged 0 to 19 over the study period, 44.3% of which were female. Risperidone, aripiprazole, olanzapine and quetiapine accounted for 76% of all treatments. The yearly volume of treatments increased by 44% between 2015 and 2023, led by the growth in the prescription of lurasidone treatments (33-fold), launched in 2019, olanzapine (3-fold), quetiapine (2.5-fold) and aripiprazole (2-fold), see Supplementary MaterialS2.Indications overallThe most frequent indications over the study period weredisorders of personality and behaviour(20.2%),ADHD(14.2%),autistic disorder and Asperger’s syndrome(13.9%),anxiety,dissociative,stress-related and somatoform disorders(hereafter referred to as ‘anxiety-related disorders’, 11.4%),dizziness and giddiness(6.6%), anddelusional and other psychotic disorders(5.8%), see Table1.. Among the top 10 indications overall, depression showed the largest increase in the total number of treatments over the study period, with a 5.7-fold rise, followed by autistic disorder and Asperger’s syndrome (2.2-fold), anxiety-related disorders, and disorders of personality and behaviour (each doubling in frequency). In contrast, the total number of treatments for ADHD decreased (0.6-fold). Although numerically less frequent, prescription of AP for suicidal attempt rose by 30.7-fold, driven by a sharp increase after 2020, see Table1.; Fig.1.Table 1.

ADHD was the most common indication for risperidone, despite its steady decline over the period (a 54% decrease) while sulpiride was mostly prescribed for dizziness and giddiness and only marginally for psychiatric indications (see Table2.and Supplementary MaterialS3-S9). Depression was among the top 10 indications for all major APs except risperidone, with a marked increase in aripiprazole treatments (3.-fold), quetiapine (17.2-fold), olanzapine (9.9-fold), and lurasidone (14.6-fold), especially after 2020. Eating disorders also reached the top 10 for all APs except for risperidone and paliperidone, and quetiapine treatments, and grew notably (7.6-fold); see Table2.and Supplementary MaterialS3-S9.Table 2.

Results are shown stratified by age group and sex assigned at birthFull size tableIndications by sexTreatments for anxiety-related disorders were more frequently observed in females, whereas ADHD treatments were more common in males. The top 10 indications for females included depression and eating disorders, while intellectual disabilities and specific developmental disorders were more prominent for males, see Table3.and Supplementary MaterialS10andS11. The yearly absolute number of treatments increased by 80% in females, compared to 26% in males, led by the rise of depression (6-fold increase), anxiety-related disorders (3-fold), disorders of personality and behaviour (2.7-fold), eating disorders (2.7-fold), and autistic disorder and Asperger’s syndrome (2.5-fold). In males, treatments for autistic disorder and Asperger’s syndrome and delusional and other psychotic disorders doubled in frequency, accompanied by the growth of other indications outside the top 10, such as psychoactive drug use (2.9-fold), depression (5.9-fold), and suicide attempt (19-fold), see Fig.2and Supplementary MaterialS10andS11.Table 3.

Across the 10–14 and 15–19 age groups, the four same indications showed the most notable increase over time. In adolescents aged 10–14, suicide attempt rose by 13.7-fold, followed by depression (11.8-fold), autistic disorder and Asperger’s syndrome (87%), anxiety-related disorders and disorders of personality and behaviour (76% increase both). In the 15–19 age group, suicide attempt showed the sharpest increase (52.3-fold), followed by depression (5.2-fold), disorders of personality and behaviour (2.7-fold), autistic disorder and Asperger’s syndrome (2.6-fold), and anxiety-related disorders (2.5-fold), see Fig.3and Supplementary MaterialsS12andS13). Among younger children, autistic disorder and Asperger’s syndrome displayed the greatest growth in both the 0–4 (5.1-fold) and 5–9 (1.9-fold) age groups, along with disorders of personality and behaviour (2.3-fold and 1.4-fold, respectively). In the 5–9 age group, schizophrenia (5.3-fold) and delusional disorders (4.2-fold) also experienced substantial increases, although their absolute numbers remained relatively low (see Fig.3and Supplementary MaterialsS14andS15).Fig. 3Evolution of the top 10 most prescribed indications in antipsychotic treatments in children and adolescents in the region of Valencia, 2015–2023, stratified by age groups.Please note that the graphs inFig. 3use different scales for improved clarityFull size imageDiscussionIn this large, population-based study of antipsychotic prescribing in children and adolescents in Spain, we provide a detailed overview of diagnostic indications and the temporal evolution of the number of treatments per indication over a nine-year period using real-world prescription data that uniquely includes prescriber-recorded indications. Our findings reveal that antipsychotics were prescribed for a wide range of clinical conditions, a vast majority outside of approved indications, and that prescribing patterns varied notably by sex and age group.The most frequently recorded indications included disorders of personality and behaviour, ADHD, autistic disorder and Asperger’s syndrome, and anxiety-related disorders. Notably, depression—while only the 8th most frequent indication overall—showed the steepest increase in the absolute number of treatments over the study period among the top 10 indications, with even higher growth among females and adolescents. These findings broadly align with those from previous studies across different health systems. In the U.S., studies based on Medicaid and privately insured populations have described increasing off-label AP use in children for disruptive behaviour, ADHD, and mood disorders [1,2,3,4]. Similarly, Australian data revealed that by 2017, depression and anxiety had become the most frequent indications for AP use in general practice, ahead of psychotic disorders [5]. In China, the most common AP indications were also emotional and behavioural disorders, including ADHD and affective conditions [6]. It is possible that the historical impact of the FDA’s black box warning on antidepressants in adolescents may have indirectly contributed to the increasing use of antipsychotics in this population [20]. Across Europe, studies from Finland, Germany, the Netherlands, the UK, and Ireland have also reported a consistent shift toward broader, often off-label AP use for conditions such as autism spectrum disorder, anxiety, and conduct problems [11,12,13,14,15,16,17].Our study adds to this literature by using prescription data including prescriber-recorded indication. This is a crucial methodological advance, as most previous studies have relied on indirect proxies to infer indication, such as diagnostic codes from administrative claims or audit tools. These approaches are prone to misclassification—either by assuming that the temporally closest diagnosis is the reason for prescribing or by applying rigid hierarchical rules that may not reflect clinical practice. Several authors have acknowledged these limitations and called for better-quality data to capture real-world prescribing rationale [1,2,4,11,13,16].Importantly, these approaches systematically underestimate by design reasons for prescribing that are less logical or rationale, thus providing a potentially incomplete picture of the variety of indications for which AP are prescribed. In contrast, we identified a wide range of non-approved uses of AP in children and adolescents, some of which experienced notable increases in frequency of prescription, such as eating disorders (specially in females), psychoactive drug use (specially in males) or suicide attempt, patterns of use that warrants further investigation. Suicide attempt, although representing a small absolute proportion of AP prescriptions, increased dramatically (30.7-fold overall, and more than 50-fold in 15–19-year-olds), which highlights growing concern over youth mental health, as suicide has become the leading cause of non-natural death among young people in Spain [21]. Finally, we identified clusters of indications unrelated to psychiatric or behavioural conditions, including a distinct pattern of high-volume sulpiride use for dizziness and giddiness—an approved indication for the drug in Spain, but only for adults [22]—which merit attention. Sulpiride’s use for this indication is particularly noteworthy given its inconsistent regulatory status across Europe: the drug was not centrally authorised by the European Medicines Agency (EMA), and individual member states have approved it nationally for varying indications.The inclusion of direct treatment indication data also allowed us to track temporal dynamics with precision. While other studies have ranked overall indications or examined cumulative patterns, our study described how the distribution of indications evolves year by year. We show, for instance, how the number of AP treatments for ADHD declined over time, while the number of treatments for depression, suicide-related symptoms, and autism-related disorders increased significantly, particularly among female and adolescent subgroups. Importantly, our findings suggest a sharp increase in prescriptions for several indications—particularly depression, anxiety-related disorders, and suicidal ideation, or autistic-related disorders in younger children—beginning in 2020. This temporal inflection coincides with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, suggesting a possible link between the global public health crisis and escalating mental health needs in youth. School closures, social isolation, disruptions to routine care, and heightened family stress may have exacerbated underlying psychological conditions or contributed to new-onset symptoms. Increases in the use of mental health services, psychotropics prescribing, and symptom burden during the pandemic have been reported in several international studies [23,24,25,26,27,28], though few have specifically documented the impact on antipsychotic prescribing in paediatric populations. Further studies adequately designed are warranted to confirm these observations.Our work has some limitations. First, VID databases contain real-world clinical practice data recorded by healthcare professionals during routine care, but they are not specifically designed for research. Studies based on real-world data like VID are susceptible to biases such as differential recording, misclassification, or missing data. Nevertheless, prescription and dispensation data in VID of high quality as they serve billing purposes and are subject to stringent administrative controls. Similarly, data on age and sex are highly reliable, as they are sourced from the region’s official population registry (Population Information System), which ensures accurate and up-to-date demographic information. Second, although indications are recorded at the time of treatment initiation, they may not always capture the full range of reasons for prescribing—particularly in cases of comorbidity or when treatment aims are symptom-based rather than diagnosis-based. In addition, there is potential for incomplete or faulty coding that may not fully reflect nuanced clinical judgment, especially in complex cases with multiple comorbidities, which are common in child and adolescent psychiatry. Third, we used the absolute number of treatments per therapeutic indication as the unit of analysis. Consequently, we described the indications with the highest prescription volumes and those showing the greatest year-on-year growth without adjusting for the underlying population at risk (e.g., prescriptions per patient, per 1,000 inhabitants, or per patient-year). In this way, our findings do not allow to directly discern whether observed increases reflect changes in prescribing intensity or shift in the size of the population and call for a cautious interpretation of our results. However, in a companion paper where we address the overall evolution of AP treatments from a population perspective [29], we found that the treatment rate increased by 44% and the rate of patients treated by 50%, with the underlying population remaining relatively stable during the study period (see Supplementary MaterialS16). Taken together, these complementary findings mitigate—though they do not entirely eliminate—the limitations inherent in relying on absolute counts alone. Fourth, we described indications for major APs by active substance, regardless of formulation. Fifth, we did not assess the appropriateness, nor the safety and effectiveness of the prescriptions, most of them in non-approved indications, which warrants urgent investigation. Importantly, the potential for long-term adverse effects of antipsychotics in children and adolescents, such as metabolic, endocrine, or neurological complications [30], should not be overlooked, even if not directly assessed in our study. Sixth, while the data reflect prescribing activity, they do not capture actual medication use or adherence. Seventh, VID data does not capture inpatient medication data nor private-sector prescriptions, which may lead to a slight underestimation of the actual volume of treatments, although their volume is likely minimal. Finally, the generalization of our results to other regions within or outside Spain should be approached with caution, as contextual factors may significantly influence prescribing patterns.Our findings underscore the growing volume of antipsychotic treatments prescribed to children and adolescents, particularly for emotional and behavioural conditions beyond psychosis, and highlight striking increases in prescriptions for depression and suicidality—apparently accelerated after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. These results highlight an urgent need to develop updated, evidence-based paediatric prescribing guidelines that support ethically sound, evidence-based clinical and prescribing practice. By leveraging prescriber-recorded indications, this study overcomes some methodological limitations of earlier work and provides a robust basis for monitoring clinical practice, informing policy, and guiding future research into the safety and appropriateness of antipsychotic use in youth.Data availabilityThe datasets presented in this article are not readily available because legal restrictions on sharing the data set apply as regulated by the Valencia regional government by means of legal resolution by the Valencia Health Agency [2009/13312] which forbids the dissemination of data to third parties (accessible at:http://www.san.gva.es/documents/152919/157920/resolucionsolicituddatos.pdf).
