## Abstract

BackgroundMany individuals with chronic tic disorders endorse sensory dysregulation. Whether sensory dysregulation is linked with co-occurring conditions or associated with greater tic severity, urge severity, or severity of co-occurring conditions in this population is unknown. Characterizing sensory dysregulation in chronic tic disorders may help illustrate the mechanisms underlying development of chronic tic disorders.MethodsWe enrolled 40 subjects ages 6 to 17 with chronic tic disorders. Sensory profiles were determined by the parent-proxy reported Short Sensory Profile 2 or the self-reported Adolescent/Adult Sensory Profile. Symptom severities for anxiety, tics, obsessive-compulsive disorder, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and premonitory urge were assessed. Anxiety disorder diagnoses were determined using the Anxiety and Related Disorders-IV Child and Parent Interview. Obsessive-compulsive disorder and ADHD diagnoses were determined by clinician interview. Relationships between abnormal sensory profiles and co-occurring conditions were assessed with the Fisher exact test. Relationships between sensory profiles and continuous variables were assessed using Student 2-sided
