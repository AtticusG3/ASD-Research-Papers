## Abstract

Despite the fact that there have been many studies on the connection between autism and psychosis, there are still many things that are unknown about the significance of this connection. Recent studies have highlighted the significant overlap between autistic traits and psychotic disorders, yet the clinical implications of these associations are not well understood. This study aims to address this knowledge gap by investigating the links between autistic features and various clinical, functional and behavioural outcomes in individuals with psychosis spectrum.
The study included 125 patients who had at least one psychotic episode and who had used antipsychotic medication for most of the treatment period. The clinician conducted face-to-face interviews to evaluate all other clinical characteristics, while self-report scales were employed to evaluate autistic features and quality of life. Complex associations were understood using path analysis.
Our study showed that there was a negative association between autistic features and functioning, quality of life and subjective treatment benefit; and a positive association with severity of disorder, severity of anxiety and depression, severity of positive and negative symptoms, suicidal ideation and behaviour, psychiatric comorbidity and number of psychotic episodes. Depression intensity mediated autistic features' effect on suicidal thoughts. Those who were non-smokers and bullied by peers reported more autistic traits.
Taken together, our results highlight the importance of autistic features in the psychosis spectrum. It is clear that there is a significant gap in clinical knowledge regarding the relationship between autism and psychosis and that further improvements in diagnostic tools and treatment options are needed. As our study is cross-sectional in design, speculation about causality is limited and further prospective research is needed.

# Clinical implications of autistic features in the psychosis spectrum: a cross-sectional study using path analysis**Publication Date:** 2025/12
The study included 125 patients who had at least one psychotic episode and who had used antipsychotic medication for most of the treatment period. The clinician conducted face-to-face interviews to evaluate all other clinical characteristics, while self-report scales were employed to evaluate autistic features and quality of life. Complex associations were understood using path analysis.
Our study showed that there was a negative association between autistic features and functioning, quality of life and subjective treatment benefit; and a positive association with severity of disorder, severity of anxiety and depression, severity of positive and negative symptoms, suicidal ideation and behaviour, psychiatric comorbidity and number of psychotic episodes. Depression intensity mediated autistic features' effect on suicidal thoughts. Those who were non-smokers and bullied by peers reported more autistic traits.
Taken together, our results highlight the importance of autistic features in the psychosis spectrum. It is clear that there is a significant gap in clinical knowledge regarding the relationship between autism and psychosis and that further improvements in diagnostic tools and treatment options are needed. As our study is cross-sectional in design, speculation about causality is limited and further prospective research is needed.## Clinical implications of autistic features in the psychosis spectrum: a cross-sectional study using path analysisEzgi Sıla Ahi Üstün

The concept of psychosis has undergone a significant transformation throughout history. Early classifications of psychosis include Ewald Hecker’s introduction of hebephrenia [2], a disorganised form of psychosis that begins in adolescence, and Sante de Sanctis’s description of dementia praecocissima [3], which outlines degenerative mental states that begin in early adulthood. These historical concepts formed the basis for later diagnostic categories such as dementia praecox and schizophrenia. Although categorical thinking have dominated psychiatry since the 1800 s, when Emil Kraepelin’s classic dichotomous approach, formulated as dementia praecox and manic-depressive psychosis attracted much attention [4], the dimensional approach, which breaks down artificial boundaries between categories of disorders, is now attracting more attention and discussion [5]. Schizophrenia, a major disorder characterised by psychosis, was first described by Eugen Bleuler in 1911 as a spectrum-based perspective with variable prognosis, in contrast to Kraepelin’s binary methodology [6]. Based on our current understanding, schizophrenia is a complex entity that encompasses a variety of pathophysiological processes and etiological factors [7, 8]. This heterogeneity has led to poor diagnostic validity and temporal continuity in classification systems [9, 10].Autism is among the limited number of disorders for which the notion of spectrum is currently included in valid classification systems. The clinical presentation of autism, a heterogeneous condition that represents an atypical developmental process, is intricate and varies between different patients and within the same patient at various periods [11, 12]. The overlap between the autism spectrum and other mental disorders may be greater than reported, and mild forms may be concealed by other mental disorders, as emphasized by certain authors [13,14,15,16]. Although the current classification system uses the word spectrum, it essentially draws a line between what autism is and what it is not, ignoring more subtle phenomena such as the broad autism phenotype or the subthreshold autism spectrum [17]. The partial manifestations of autism may exhibit a higher vulnerability to psychopathology [18].Eugen Bleuler formally used the word autism in 1908 to describe one of the four primary symptoms of schizophrenia. In his conceptualisation, schizophrenia was characterised by four fundamental disturbances (autism, ambivalence, affective disturbance and association disturbance) known as Bleuler’s “Four A’s”. In this context, autism referred to pathological withdrawal from reality and an inward orientation of thought and feeling, resulting in impaired interpersonal communication and social reciprocity. Bleuler regarded autism as not just a fundamental manifestation of schizophrenia, but also as a composite variable encompassing a broad spectrum of non-schizophrenic conditions [19, 20]. Prior to Leo Kanner’s research, Grunya Sukhareva had already described schizoid psychopathy in children in 1926 [21]. This condition exhibits striking similarities to the characteristics of autism spectrum disorders observed today. Theodor Heller also introduced the concept of dementia infantilis, referring to regressive developmental disorders that align with later definitions of autism [22]. Leo Kanner employed the term autism to denote a distinctive disorder, rather than a symptom. Just one year later, Hans Asperger coined the term autistic psychopathy to describe people who had similar social difficulties, but whose language and cognitive abilities were relatively intact [23]. Nevertheless, autism and infantile schizophrenia were used interchangeably as synonyms until the development of the DSM-III (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-III). The cause of this phenomenon can be attributed to the overlap in the conceptualization of symptoms [24]. Later, as the emphasis on diagnostic specificity increased, classification systems began to draw a clearer boundary between autism and schizophrenia. In the DSM-III and DSM-IV, a diagnosis of autism, particularly pervasive developmental disorders with an early-onset, was an exclusion criterion for schizophrenia, and vice versa. This mutual exclusivity limited the possibility of systematically studying their co-occurrence or phenotypic overlap. It was only with the publication of the DSM-IV-TR, and subsequently the DSM-V, that it became diagnostically permissible to recognise both conditions in the same individual, allowing for a more nuanced and dimensional investigation of their interrelations. Indeed, when we look at the current classification systems, the DSM-V and the ICD-11(International Classification of Diseases-11), we can see that a more dimensional approach has been adopted for the concepts of autism and psychosis than in previous systems. Rather than attempting to divide autism and schizophrenia into subtypes and categorise them, the spectrum concept has introduced a more flexible approach.There are numerous phenotypic similarities and risk factors between the concepts of autism and psychosis [25]. Psychotic disorders are approximately 3–10 times more prevalent in individuals diagnosed with autism than in the general population [26,27,28,29,30]. Psychotic symptoms in autistic patients have longer hospital stays [31], higher anxiety [32, 33], and suicidal ideation [34, 35]. The presence and clinical implications of autism spectrum disorder or autistic traits in individuals with psychotic disorders remain insufficiently understood. This gap may partially stem from the challenges inherent in identifying autistic features within populations affected by psychosis, where overlapping symptomatology and cognitive impairments can obscure developmental histories. But in this patient group, autistic features may make the person more vulnerable by adding to their neurodevelopmental burden, decreasing their ability to adapt, and decreasing their family’s social support.The presence of autism or autistic features in patients with psychotic disorders has been linked to a decreased quality of life and social functioning, as well as an increase in depression, hopelessness, and suicidality, in the relatively few studies conducted to date [36,37,38]. Our objective in this study was to examine the significance of autistic characteristics within the psychosis spectrum by examining the concepts of autism and psychosis from a dimensional perspective. Based on prior literature, we hypothesised that higher levels of autistic features would be associated with an earlier age of onset, increased psychiatric comorbidity, a lower quality of life and poorer functioning, and elevated levels of anxiety, depression and suicidality. We also hypothesised that autistic features would be associated with broader clinical and psychosocial difficulties. This could lead to an increased overall burden of the disorder, posing greater challenges in terms of adaptation and treatment outcomes.## MethodsSample and design of the studyThe study comprised individuals between the ages of 18 and 55 who were undergoing outpatient or inpatient treatment at the Psychiatry Department of Ankara University Faculty of Medicine. These patients had to have had at least one psychotic episode that had a substantial impact on the progression of their condition, were prescribed antipsychotic medication for at least half of the treatment period, and had done at least primary school (to enable them to complete self-report scales). Patients with intellectual disability and those who had used substances within the previous 1 month were not included in the study. Between May and October 2023, psychiatrists working in the outpatient and inpatient clinics referred patients who met the inclusion criteria to the research team. While a strictly consecutive sampling procedure was not employed, clinicians referred patients to the research team based solely on the predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria. No additional subjective evaluation or discretionary selection was applied in the referral process. Importantly, patients recruited from inpatient settings were assessed during the later stages of hospitalisation, closer to discharge. They were only assessed when they were clinically stable and not agitated, to ensure that they could reliably complete the assessments. A total of 147 patients who were eligible were interviewed. 20 patients did not wish to participate in the study due to lack of time and 2 patients were unable to cooperate with the interview due to severe anxiety symptoms. After being informed about the study, the eligible patients signed the informed consent form. The study was completed with 125 patients and did not include a healthy control group. The study was conducted at the Faculty of Medicine at Ankara University, a tertiary care reference hospital located in the capital city of Turkey. The Psychiatry Department serves a wide catchment area and receives patients through referral and self-admission from various regions of Ankara and neighbouring provinces. This covers urban and semi-urban populations. As the hospital primarily serves patients with national health insurance, the sample represents a socioeconomically diverse group with varying levels of education, income and access to resources. The Human Research Ethics Committee of Ankara University Faculty of Medicine granted ethical approval under decision number İ04-214-23 and all procedures followed the Declaration of Helsinki and all applicable legal requirements.The ESAÜ conducted a detailed clinical history and mental status examination of participants, who were interviewed in a hospital setting for approximately 90 minutes. The electronic medical records and charts of all patients included in the study were reviewed. All electronic medical records and individual patient charts confirmed that none of the patients presented evidence of an organic cause for psychosis. Rather than being part of this specific study, the following procedures are standard components of the routine work-up at our hospital: Laboratory evaluations included complete blood count, liver and kidney function tests, thyroid function tests, serum electrolytes, and markers such as vitamin B12, vitamin D, C-reactive protein, and creatinine phosphokinase. Infectious screening was conducted for pathogens including Toxoplasma gondii, brucellosis, HSV, CMV, EBV, HIV, among others. Autoantibody testing was performed for systemic autoimmune diseases (e.g., systemic lupus erythematosus, Sjögren’s syndrome, antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, Hashimoto’s thyroiditis), ANCA-associated vasculitis, and anti-GAD antibodies. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis included cell count, protein, glucose, albumin quotient, Gram stain, viral PCR panel (HSV-1/2, VZV, CMV, EBV, HHV-6, enterovirus), oligoclonal bands, IgG index, and neuronal surface antibodies (NMDAR, LGI1, CASPR2, GABABR, AMPAR) as well as onconeural antibodies (Hu, Yo, Ri, Ma2, CV2/CRMP5, amphiphysin). All patients underwent electroencephalogram(EEG) and brain imaging. Alcohol and substance use were assessed based on clinical history, and individuals who had used alcohol or substances within the past month were excluded. All included patients had neuropsychological and intelligence assessments within normal limits documented in their medical records. The scales and the forms that were filled in by the researcher (ESAÜ) during this interview are as follows: ‘Sociodemographic Data and Anamnesis Form’ in light of the results of the anamnesis and psychiatric examination, “Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) Scale” to assess functionality, “Clinical Global Impression Scale (CGI)” to assess disorder severity, “Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS)” to assess the severity of positive and negative symptoms, “Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAM-A)” and “Hamilton Depression Scale (HAM-D)” to assess the severity of anxiety and depression, respectively, “Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS)” to assess suicidal thoughts, the intensity of these thoughts, suicidal behaviour and the severity of suicide attempts. The patients completed self-report scales after a short break following the interview with the researcher ESAÜ. These scales were kept in a separate location until the end of the study. The self-report scales completed by the patients can be listed as follows: “Autism Spectrum Quotient (AQ)” to assess autistic features, “The World Health Organization Quality of Life Brief Version (WHOQOL-BREF)” to assess quality of life. In our study, we aimed to assess the relationship between autistic features and clinical characteristics as assessed by the above-mentioned instruments. Consequently, in order to eliminate clinician bias, we evaluated autistic features using a self-report instrument, the AQ, and maintained it in a separate location until the conclusion of the study.Data collection toolsSociodemographic data and anamnesis formA form was prepared by the researchers in which information such as the patient’s age, sex, marital status, education level, age at the onset of the first psychiatric symptoms, age at initial psychiatric admission, duration of untreated psychosis (DUP), number of psychiatric hospitalisations, number of psychotic episodes, psychotropic treatments received, subjective benefit of the treatment, whether the patient had experienced a criminal behaviour, alcohol-substance and cigarette use, whether the patient had been subjected to peer bullying, and psychiatric comorbidities were questioned (see the supplementary material).Global assessment of functioning scale (GAF)It is a scale that helps clinicians to assess functioning by giving a score between 1 and 100, which helps to monitor the clinical course of individuals. Increasing scores indicate better functioning [39]. This scale, developed by the American Psychiatric Association, has frequently been used in studies conducted in our country and around the world due to its ease of use [40,41,42].Clinical global impression scale (CGI)It is a scale consisting of 3 dimensions to assess the clinical course of psychiatric disorders [43]. The first part (CGI - Severity of Illness) is assessed from 1 to 7 points according to the severity of the illness at that time(1: Normal, not at all ill, 2: Borderline mentally ill, 3: Mildly ill, 4: Moderately ill, 5: Markedly ill, 6: Severely ill, 7: Among the most extremely ill patients). Only the first part was used in this study. This scale is widely used both around the world and in our own country [44,45,46].Positive and negative syndrome scale (PANSS)Developed by Kay et al. in 1987 to assess the severity of schizophrenia [47]. It consists of three subscales of thirty items: general psychopathology (sixteen questions), positive symptoms (seven questions) and negative symptoms (seven questions). It is a semi-structured seven-point Likert-type scale. High scores correlate with severity of illness. A reliability and validity study of the PANSS in the Turkish population was conducted, and the scale is commonly used in studies of psychotic populations [48,49,50].Hamilton anxiety scale (HAM-A)It was developed by Hamilton in 1959 to determine the severity of anxiety. Consisting of 14 questions, the scale is applied by the researcher [51]. The total score ranges from 0 to 56 and higher scores are associated with higher anxiety. Its validity and reliability in Turkish have been established by Yazıcı and colleagues, and it has been frequently used in studies with psychotic populations [52,53,54].Hamilton depression scale (HAM-D)The scale developed by Max Hamilton to measure the severity of depression consists of 17 items [55]. Items are scored on a scale of 0–4, with a maximum score of 51. High scores are associated with high levels of depression. The Turkish validity and reliability study was conducted by Akdemir and colleagues and is frequently used in our country [56].Columbia suicide severity rating scale (C-SSRS)It is a semi-structured scale developed by Posner et al. [57]. It consists of 4 subscales questioning suicidal ideation, intensity of suicidal thoughts, suicidal behaviour and severity of suicide attempts. In the first part, the participant is asked to answer yes or no to 5 questions questioning suicidal ideation in various degrees. Suicidal ideation is scored between 1 and 5. If the answer is no to the first two questions, the third section is continuedThe suicidal ideation identified in the first part is scored between 2 and 25 points in the second part with questions questioning the intensity of the ideation such as frequency, duration, controllability, deterrent situations and reasons for the ideation. In the third part, the presence of suicidal or self-injurious behaviour in the past is questioned, prevented attempts, stopped attempts and the presence of preparatory behaviours are evaluated. In the last section, the level of lethality in the presence of suicide attempt is scored between 0 and 5. A validity and reliability study was conducted in Turkish by Güneş and colleagues [58].Autism spectrum quotient (AQ)AQ is a self-report scale developed by Baron-Cohen et al. [59]. Aims to determine the level of autistic features of an adult without intellectual disability [60]. The scale consists of five domains: switching attention, social skills, attention to detail, imagination and communication. The scale consists of 50 items, with 10 items assessing each of the five subscales. Higher scores on each subscale indicate a greater degree of atypicality in that specific domain. The AQ, a four-point Likert scale, offers four different options for each question. These options are “definitely agree”, “slightly agree”, “slightly disagree” and “definitely disagree”. One point is awarded for each question if the participant selects an option suggesting mild or severe abnormal/autistic-like behaviour. Scale items are scored dichotomously as 0 or 1. For each question, 1 point is given if the participant has marked autistic-like behaviours. Each question that is answered in line with the defined autism phenotype is worth one point, with a total possible score of 50. AQ has previously been used in other studies as a measure of autism features in psychosis populations [61,62,63]. Bora and colleagues conducted a validity and reliability study of the Turkish version of this scale in 2010 [60]. In the Turkish version of the scale, no cut-off point has been defined to distinguish between patients and healthy individuals. Higher scores indicate a greater number of autistic traits [60].The world health organization quality of life brief version (WHOQOL-BREF)It is a self-report scale developed for subjective assessment of quality of life. As the subjective quality of life increases, the score increases [64, 65]. This scale has been tested for validity and reliability in Turkish [64].Statistical analysisStatistical analyses were conducted using software developed by International Business Machines Corporation (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA): IBM SPSS Statistics (version 23) and IBM AMOS™ (version 24).Data conformance to normal distribution was assessed using Kolmogorov-Smirnov and Shapiro-Wilk tests. The Independent Two Sample t test was employed to compare data that exhibited a normal distribution across binary groups, whereas the Mann Whitney U test was implemented to compare data that did not exhibit a normal distribution. Data conforming to normal distribution in groups of three or more were compared using the One-way Analysis of Variance test. Multiple comparisons were analysed using the Duncan test. A Kruskal-Wallis H test was employed to evaluate data that deviated from a normal distribution in groups of three or more. Multiple comparisons were then assessed using Dunn’s test. Spearman’s rho correlation coefficient was used to analyse the relationship between scale scores that did not fit the normal distribution and continuous parameters. To examine the effect of other scale scores on the total AQ score, path analysis was used in IBM AMOS™ (version 24). Path analysis and bootstrap maximum likelihood methods were used to test the model. The results of the analyses are presented as frequencies (percentages) for categorical variables and means ± standard deviations and medians (minimum-maximum) for quantitative variables. P < 0.050 was used as the significance level.Taking the correlation coefficient between the AQ total score and functionality as 0.25 and performing sample calculation using the correlation test with 80% power and 0.05 significance level, it was determined that a total sample of 123 people was sufficient for this study. Power analysis was conducted using G*Power (version 3.1; Heinrich Heine University Düsseldorf, Germany), a freely available general power analysis software.## ResultsSociodemographic and clinical characteristics of patientsThe socio-demographic and clinical characteristics of the participants are summarised in Table 1.Table 1 Sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of the participantsFull size tableInvestigating the association of autistic features with socio-demographic and clinical characteristicsThe association between clinical characteristics and autistic features, as evaluated by AQ total and subscale scores, is elaborated upon in Tables 2 and 3. However, if we briefly list the statistically significant results, the severity of autistic features is higher in those with additional psychiatric diagnoses (compared to those without), non-smokers (compared to smokers) and those who have been bullied by peers (compared to those who have not). There is a negative correlation between autistic features and subjective treatment benefit, functioning and quality of life. The number of psychotic episodes, severity of the disorder, severity of positive and negative symptoms, anxiety and depression, and parameters assessing suicide risk (excluding the severity of current suicidal behavior) are all positively correlated with autistic features.Table 2 Comparison of autistic features according to categorical socio-demographic and clinical characteristicsFull size tableTable 3 Relationship between quantitative clinical characteristics and autistic featuresFull size tableUnderstanding complex relationships with path analysisOn the basis of previous studies and our clinical knowledge, we present a path analysis of the complex relationships between the different variables. Our hypothesis was that the severity of the disorder, level of functioning, quality of life, severity of positive and negative symptoms, severity of depression and anxiety, and suicide risk would be influenced by autistic features. However, because these clinical features are interconnected, complex conditions that influence each other, we believe that there are interactions and mediating effects between them. We postulated that the quality of life may be influenced by autistic characteristics in both direct and indirect ways, including the severity of the disorder, the severity of positive and negative symptoms, and the levels of anxiety and depression. We also hypothesised that the effect of autistic features on suicide parameters would be both direct and indirect through the severity of depression and anxiety. As depression and anxiety levels assess the current situation, we hypothesised that they might influence current suicidal ideation. We assessed the risk of suicide in various sub-dimensions and presupposed that they are interdependent. We hypothesised that lifetime suicidal ideation would influence lifetime suicidal behaviour; current suicidal ideation would influence current suicidal behaviour; lifetime suicidal behaviour would influence the potential lethality of suicide attempts. Figure 1 summarises all these relationships(the arrow is drawn from the influencing side to the influenced side). The model relationships and standardized regression coefficients are illustrated in Fig. 1, and the mediating effects are summarized in Table 4. Model fit was acceptable (Root Mean Square Error of Approximation: 0.090, Tucker-Lewis Index: 0.918, Comparative Fit Index: 0.958). Statistically significant relationships are marked with an asterisk (*) in the figure and in bold in the table. According to the results of the path analysis, autistic features have a direct effect on almost all clinical parameters (except current suicidal ideation, lifetime suicidal behaviour and potential lethality of actual suicide attempts). In addition, autistic features appear to have an effect on current suicidal ideation and quality of life through the severity of depression. Although autistic features have not been shown to have a significant direct effect on lifetime suicidal behaviour, they do appear to have an indirect effect through lifetime suicidal ideation.Fig. 1Path analysis. GAF, Global Assesment of Functioning scale; PANSS, Positive and negative syndrome scale; QOL, Quality of life; CGI, Clinical global impression.

Depression was found to mediate the relationship between autistic features and suicidal ideation, highlighting its critical role in this population. In particular, those exposed to peer bullying and those who did not smoke reported more autistic characteristics. These findings support a dimensional view of autism within the psychosis spectrum and highlight the clinical relevance of subthreshold autistic features. Recognising and addressing these features may improve outcomes in psychotic disorders, justifying more nuanced assessment strategies in routine care.## Sample and design of the studyThe study comprised individuals between the ages of 18 and 55 who were undergoing outpatient or inpatient treatment at the Psychiatry Department of Ankara University Faculty of Medicine.

Consequently, in order to eliminate clinician bias, we evaluated autistic features using a self-report instrument, the AQ, and maintained it in a separate location until the conclusion of the study.## Sociodemographic data and anamnesis formA form was prepared by the researchers in which information such as the patient’s age, sex, marital status, education level, age at the onset of the first psychiatric symptoms, age at initial psychiatric admission, duration of untreated psychosis (DUP), number of psychiatric hospitalisations, number of psychotic episodes, psychotropic treatments received, subjective benefit of the treatment, whether the patient had experienced a criminal behaviour, alcohol-substance and cigarette use, whether the patient had been subjected to peer bullying, and psychiatric comorbidities were questioned (see the supplementary material).## Global assessment of functioning scale (GAF)It is a scale that helps clinicians to assess functioning by giving a score between 1 and 100, which helps to monitor the clinical course of individuals. Increasing scores indicate better functioning [39]. This scale, developed by the American Psychiatric Association, has frequently been used in studies conducted in our country and around the world due to its ease of use [40,41,42].## Clinical global impression scale (CGI)It is a scale consisting of 3 dimensions to assess the clinical course of psychiatric disorders [43]. The first part (CGI - Severity of Illness) is assessed from 1 to 7 points according to the severity of the illness at that time(1: Normal, not at all ill, 2: Borderline mentally ill, 3: Mildly ill, 4: Moderately ill, 5: Markedly ill, 6: Severely ill, 7: Among the most extremely ill patients). Only the first part was used in this study. This scale is widely used both around the world and in our own country [44,45,46].## Positive and negative syndrome scale (PANSS)Developed by Kay et al. in 1987 to assess the severity of schizophrenia [47]. It consists of three subscales of thirty items: general psychopathology (sixteen questions), positive symptoms (seven questions) and negative symptoms (seven questions). It is a semi-structured seven-point Likert-type scale. High scores correlate with severity of illness. A reliability and validity study of the PANSS in the Turkish population was conducted, and the scale is commonly used in studies of psychotic populations [48,49,50].## Hamilton anxiety scale (HAM-A)It was developed by Hamilton in 1959 to determine the severity of anxiety. Consisting of 14 questions, the scale is applied by the researcher [51]. The total score ranges from 0 to 56 and higher scores are associated with higher anxiety. Its validity and reliability in Turkish have been established by Yazıcı and colleagues, and it has been frequently used in studies with psychotic populations [52,53,54].## Hamilton depression scale (HAM-D)The scale developed by Max Hamilton to measure the severity of depression consists of 17 items [55]. Items are scored on a scale of 0–4, with a maximum score of 51. High scores are associated with high levels of depression. The Turkish validity and reliability study was conducted by Akdemir and colleagues and is frequently used in our country [56].## Columbia suicide severity rating scale (C-SSRS)It is a semi-structured scale developed by Posner et al. [57]. It consists of 4 subscales questioning suicidal ideation, intensity of suicidal thoughts, suicidal behaviour and severity of suicide attempts. In the first part, the participant is asked to answer yes or no to 5 questions questioning suicidal ideation in various degrees. Suicidal ideation is scored between 1 and 5. If the answer is no to the first two questions, the third section is continuedThe suicidal ideation identified in the first part is scored between 2 and 25 points in the second part with questions questioning the intensity of the ideation such as frequency, duration, controllability, deterrent situations and reasons for the ideation. In the third part, the presence of suicidal or self-injurious behaviour in the past is questioned, prevented attempts, stopped attempts and the presence of preparatory behaviours are evaluated. In the last section, the level of lethality in the presence of suicide attempt is scored between 0 and 5. A validity and reliability study was conducted in Turkish by Güneş and colleagues [58].## Autism spectrum quotient (AQ)AQ is a self-report scale developed by Baron-Cohen et al. [59]. Aims to determine the level of autistic features of an adult without intellectual disability [60]. The scale consists of five domains: switching attention, social skills, attention to detail, imagination and communication. The scale consists of 50 items, with 10 items assessing each of the five subscales. Higher scores on each subscale indicate a greater degree of atypicality in that specific domain. The AQ, a four-point Likert scale, offers four different options for each question. These options are “definitely agree”, “slightly agree”, “slightly disagree” and “definitely disagree”. One point is awarded for each question if the participant selects an option suggesting mild or severe abnormal/autistic-like behaviour. Scale items are scored dichotomously as 0 or 1. For each question, 1 point is given if the participant has marked autistic-like behaviours. Each question that is answered in line with the defined autism phenotype is worth one point, with a total possible score of 50. AQ has previously been used in other studies as a measure of autism features in psychosis populations [61,62,63]. Bora and colleagues conducted a validity and reliability study of the Turkish version of this scale in 2010 [60]. In the Turkish version of the scale, no cut-off point has been defined to distinguish between patients and healthy individuals. Higher scores indicate a greater number of autistic traits [60].## The world health organization quality of life brief version (WHOQOL-BREF)It is a self-report scale developed for subjective assessment of quality of life. As the subjective quality of life increases, the score increases [64, 65]. This scale has been tested for validity and reliability in Turkish [64].## Statistical analysisStatistical analyses were conducted using software developed by International Business Machines Corporation (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA): IBM SPSS Statistics (version 23) and IBM AMOS™ (version 24).Data conformance to normal distribution was assessed using Kolmogorov-Smirnov and Shapiro-Wilk tests. The Independent Two Sample t test was employed to compare data that exhibited a normal distribution across binary groups, whereas the Mann Whitney U test was implemented to compare data that did not exhibit a normal distribution. Data conforming to normal distribution in groups of three or more were compared using the One-way Analysis of Variance test. Multiple comparisons were analysed using the Duncan test. A Kruskal-Wallis H test was employed to evaluate data that deviated from a normal distribution in groups of three or more. Multiple comparisons were then assessed using Dunn’s test. Spearman’s rho correlation coefficient was used to analyse the relationship between scale scores that did not fit the normal distribution and continuous parameters. To examine the effect of other scale scores on the total AQ score, path analysis was used in IBM AMOS™ (version 24). Path analysis and bootstrap maximum likelihood methods were used to test the model. The results of the analyses are presented as frequencies (percentages) for categorical variables and means ± standard deviations and medians (minimum-maximum) for quantitative variables. P < 0.050 was used as the significance level.
Taking the correlation coefficient between the AQ total score and functionality as 0.25 and performing sample calculation using the correlation test with 80% power and 0.05 significance level, it was determined that a total sample of 123 people was sufficient for this study. Power analysis was conducted using G*Power (version 3.1; Heinrich Heine University Düsseldorf, Germany), a freely available general power analysis software.## Sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of patientsThe socio-demographic and clinical characteristics of the participants are summarised in Table 1.
Table 1 Sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of the participantsFull size table## Investigating the association of autistic features with socio-demographic and clinical characteristicsThe association between clinical characteristics and autistic features, as evaluated by AQ total and subscale scores, is elaborated upon in Tables 2 and 3. However, if we briefly list the statistically significant results, the severity of autistic features is higher in those with additional psychiatric diagnoses (compared to those without), non-smokers (compared to smokers) and those who have been bullied by peers (compared to those who have not). There is a negative correlation between autistic features and subjective treatment benefit, functioning and quality of life. The number of psychotic episodes, severity of the disorder, severity of positive and negative symptoms, anxiety and depression, and parameters assessing suicide risk (excluding the severity of current suicidal behavior) are all positively correlated with autistic features.

Table 3 Relationship between quantitative clinical characteristics and autistic featuresFull size table## Understanding complex relationships with path analysisOn the basis of previous studies and our clinical knowledge, we present a path analysis of the complex relationships between the different variables. Our hypothesis was that the severity of the disorder, level of functioning, quality of life, severity of positive and negative symptoms, severity of depression and anxiety, and suicide risk would be influenced by autistic features. However, because these clinical features are interconnected, complex conditions that influence each other, we believe that there are interactions and mediating effects between them. We postulated that the quality of life may be influenced by autistic characteristics in both direct and indirect ways, including the severity of the disorder, the severity of positive and negative symptoms, and the levels of anxiety and depression. We also hypothesised that the effect of autistic features on suicide parameters would be both direct and indirect through the severity of depression and anxiety. As depression and anxiety levels assess the current situation, we hypothesised that they might influence current suicidal ideation. We assessed the risk of suicide in various sub-dimensions and presupposed that they are interdependent. We hypothesised that lifetime suicidal ideation would influence lifetime suicidal behaviour; current suicidal ideation would influence current suicidal behaviour; lifetime suicidal behaviour would influence the potential lethality of suicide attempts. Figure 1 summarises all these relationships(the arrow is drawn from the influencing side to the influenced side). The model relationships and standardized regression coefficients are illustrated in Fig. 1, and the mediating effects are summarized in Table 4. Model fit was acceptable (Root Mean Square Error of Approximation: 0.090, Tucker-Lewis Index: 0.918, Comparative Fit Index: 0.958). Statistically significant relationships are marked with an asterisk (*) in the figure and in bold in the table. According to the results of the path analysis, autistic features have a direct effect on almost all clinical parameters (except current suicidal ideation, lifetime suicidal behaviour and potential lethality of actual suicide attempts). In addition, autistic features appear to have an effect on current suicidal ideation and quality of life through the severity of depression. Although autistic features have not been shown to have a significant direct effect on lifetime suicidal behaviour, they do appear to have an indirect effect through lifetime suicidal ideation.

Table 4 Summary of mediating effects analysed by path analysisFull size table## DiscussionIn light of the continuous distribution of autistic traits in the population and the higher prevalence of co-occurring psychosocial and psychiatric difficulties in patients diagnosed with autism, individuals who exhibit more autistic features but are not diagnosed with autism according to official diagnostic criteria may experience more psychiatric and psychosocial problems. In our study, we evaluated the concepts of psychosis and autism from a dimensional perspective and investigated the clinical significance of autistic features in the psychosis spectrum. Given that our objective was not to diagnose autism, we approached the investigation of the relationship between autistic features and clinical characteristics by evaluating the severity of these features as a spectrum, rather than establishing a cut-off point in the AQ in terms of autism and declaring that autism is either present or absent. We endeavored to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of numerous clinical features in our study. While each of these features could have been the subject of separate studies and articles in the literature, we, the authors of the study, believe that it would be more beneficial to evaluate them as a whole.Initially, the study aimed to investigate the clinical observation that autistic features negatively affect quality of life and functioning, which are critical outcomes. Our findings are consistent with this observation and differ from previous studies by focusing on a sample with different diagnoses but a common history of psychosis, without categorising autistic features as high/low or present/absent. A study of 99 patients with first-episode psychosis found that a higher level of autistic traits was substantially correlated with a lower quality of life and decreased functioning [38]. Vaskinn and Abu-Akel reported that in a group of psychotic patients with schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder, the co-occurrence of more psychotic features and autistic features was interestingly associated with better functioning. The authors explain this situation with the diametric model [66]. Another study using a dimensional model found no correlation between higher autistic traits and improved symptoms or functioning in individuals with psychosis [38, 67, 68].Our research demonstrated a positive correlation between autistic features and CGI, which is a measure of the severity of the disorder, the PANSS, which evaluates the severity of positive and negative symptoms. Barlati et al.. studied 75 individuals and found that high autistic features were associated with more negative symptoms and general psychopathology, but no differences in positive symptoms or psychosocial functioning [69]. Due to their shared phenotypes, it may be challenging to differentiate between negative and positive symptoms and autistic features. Negative and positive symptoms that overlap in clinical presentation with autism may be the result of similar biological mechanisms [70]. Similarly, we observed a weak positive correlation between the number of psychotic episodes and autistic features. Many studies have highlighted the strong connection between autistic traits and psychotic experiences [71]. Nevertheless, we are of the opinion that these findings should be interpreted with cautiousness. It may well be that people diagnosed with autism are more vulnerable to developing psychosis, but it is important not to rule out the possibility of false positives. For instance, individuals with autism may be misdiagnosed with psychosis due to their sensory sensitivity or attention to detail. In the presence of a diagnosis of autism, the current diagnostic criteria for schizophrenia suggest that a more careful diagnosis of schizophrenia be made. In order to prevent misdiagnosis, unnecessary comorbidity, or unnecessary antipsychotic medication, it would be advantageous to investigate various assessment instruments in this patient group, given the overlapping presentations of psychosis and autism.Our study showed that autistic features were positively correlated with the severity of depression and anxiety. Autistic and psychotic characteristics were significant independent predictors of depression and suicidality, as demonstrated by cross-sectional data from a sample of the adult population in the United Kingdom [72]. By the age of 18, 14–20% of young individuals with autism spectrum disorder have experienced a significant depressive episode [73]. In parallel, severe depression may be experienced by up to 80% of individuals with schizophrenia, which can have significant long-term effects, such as suicide [74]. One of the few studies to investigate the correlation between suicidal behavior and autistic traits found that suicidal behavior was substantially predicted by autistic traits [75]. In our research, the interviewer evaluated suicidal ideation, suicidal behavior, and the severity of actual attempts separately using the C-SSRS. According to the results of the path analysis, autistic features seem to be particularly related to the severity of lifetime suicidal ideation. Additionally, path analysis indicates that while autistic features have not been demonstrated to have a direct significant impact on lifetime suicidal behavior, they appear to have an indirect effect through lifetime suicidal ideation. Additionally, autistic features have not been demonstrated to have a direct significant impact on subscale scores assessing current suicide risk, but they appear to have an indirect effect on current suicidal ideation through depression severity. According to a study conducted in the United Kingdom, the prevalence of autism diagnosis (10.8%) in individuals who died by suicide was significantly higher than the anticipated prevalence rate of 1.1% in the general population. The study interviewed next of kin to investigate the presence of autism diagnosis and high autistic traits in the individuals concerned [76]. Suicide, a serious problem in psychiatry, is particularly critical in psychotic patients. Depression is also common in this group, as our research has shown. It is important to prioritise and treat depression promptly, as it is often overshadowed by the focus on psychotic symptoms.Research in the literature has demonstrated that autism is linked to higher risk factors for psychopathology, including as exposure to traumatic life events [77]. In one research, 45 adults with autism were compared to 42 healthy controls. In childhood, the autism group reported experiencing more maltreatment and emotional bullying; no significant difference was found between the groups in terms of criminal behaviour [78]. Several studies have reported that children with autism are more likely to be bullied by their peers [79,80,81,82]. In our study, the severity of autistic traits did not differ according to whether the patients had experienced criminal behaviour or not, but it was observed that those who had been subjected to peer bullying had more autistic traits than those who had not. The heightened social susceptibility of individuals with autism makes them more susceptible to risks such as peer bullying and abuse. To the best of our knowledge, no other study has investigated the relationship between autistic features and criminal behavior and peer bullying in adult patients with psychotic disorders.When we examined the relationship between autistic features and the values we obtained from the medical history interviews we conducted with the patients in our study, we found no significant relationship or difference between age at onset of psychiatric symptoms, age at first psychiatric admission, duration of untreated psychosis (DUP), number of psychiatric hospitalisations, sex, marital status, presence or absence of children, alcohol and substance use, and clozapine use and autistic features. Study evidence regarding autistic features and these demographic and clinical characteristics is quite restricted. As the recognition and early intervention of psychotic symptoms is crucial in the treatment of psychosis, much attention has been paid in recent years to the duration of untreated psychosis (DUP). In a recent study of patients with first-episode psychosis, no association was found between the time elapsed between psychotic symptoms and the start of antipsychotic medication and autistic traits [83]. In this sense, higher sample size longitudinal research will be quite illuminating. The mean AQ total scores of individuals with comorbid psychiatric diagnoses and those without comorbid psychiatric diagnoses were different in our study. Therefore, it can be concluded that individuals with comorbid psychiatric diagnoses exhibited a greater number of autistic features than those without comorbid psychiatric diagnoses. Autistic features may complicate the clinical presentation and increase the tendency to make additional diagnoses; on the other hand, increased sensitivity to autism may predispose to other psychopathologies through common mechanisms; of course, it could be both. According to the information we obtained from the patient interviews, the median AQ communication subscale score showed a significant difference according to smoking, and smokers reported fewer autistic characteristics according to the AQ communication subscale score. Studies of the prevalence of smoking among psychiatric patients have reported high rates, particularly among those with schizophrenia [84, 85]. In contrast to individuals with schizophrenia, research indicates that the prevalence of smoking among individuals with autism is exceedingly low [86]. To the best of our knowledge, there is no other study in the literature that examines the relationship between smoking status and autistic features in psychosis spectrum disorders.This study’s strengths include evaluating autistic feautures as a spectrum, using detailed patient interviews, and exploring their clinical significance in the psychosis spectrum from multiple perspectives. Another important methodological strength of the study was the careful exclusion of potential organic causes of psychosis, achieved by carefully reviewing electronic medical records and clinical files. Data obtained from routine investigations, including brain imaging, electroencephalography (EEG), cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis and blood tests covering hormonal, vitamin, infectious and autoimmune panels, were carefully evaluated. If any of these assessments indicated an organic cause of the psychosis, the patient was excluded from the study. Patients with a documented intellectual disability or an IQ score below 80, as determined by prior neurocognitive assessments recorded in their medical files, were also excluded. These procedures were implemented to minimise potential confounding factors. Nevertheless, several limitations should be acknowledged. Although medication use was recorded, chlorpromazine equivalent doses were not included in the analyses due to the unreliability of retrospective medication histories, particularly among patients who had received treatment for longer before the implementation of national digital health records in Turkey. Instead, antipsychotic treatment was categorised as clozapine versus non-clozapine use. Additionally, caffeine consumption was not systematically assessed and therefore could not be analysed. While body mass index and smoking duration (pack-years) were available and included in the analysis, other potentially relevant lifestyle factors were not collected. Furthermore, individuals who reported alcohol or substance use in the past month were excluded based on clinical interviews and a review of medical records. However, no toxicological testing (urine or blood screening) was conducted at the time of assessment, which may have limited the objective verification of recent use. But this approach reflects the standard clinical practice in Turkey, where routine screening for substance metabolites in urine or blood is generally not implemented outside of dedicated addiction centers. This is partly due to the relatively low prevalence of substance use among individuals with psychotic disorders in the country compared to global estimates. For example, Turkish epidemiological studies have reported a 14% lifetime prevalence [87], a 5.2% two-year prevalence [88], and a 4% point prevalence [89]—rates that remain substantially lower than those reported in international literature. Another limitation is that measurement tools may not be fully applicable to this patient group, as there is no optimal tool available yet. The AQ used to assess autistic features is a self-report scale with high sensitivity but low specificity, and of course this can be considered a limitation, but as it is the only scale in our country that has been shown to be valid and reliable in assessing autistic features in the psychotic group, we have no other alternative to be honest. Another limitation can be seen as not separating patients according to diagnostic categories, but the effort to categorise patients into strict diagnostic groups was considered unnecessary considering the aims of this study. While this allowed for a broader exploration of transdiagnostic relationships, it may limit comparability with disorder-specific studies. Lastly, As a cross-sectional study, causality cannot be determined, emphasizing the need for longitudinal research.## Data availabilityThe datasets used and/or analysed during the current study are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request.## AbbreviationsGAF:
