## Abstract

Rett Syndrome (RTT) is an X-linked progressive disease affecting 1 in 10,000 females.
We report a 13.9-year-old girl, with a complex neurodevelopmental disorder including ASD, ID with the appearance, at 9 years of age, of vocal and motor tics involving the upper limbs and trunk, suggesting a diagnosis of Tourette's syndrome (TS). Tics were also present in the mother and grandmother. The patient was followed-up for approximately 10 years and underwent periodic clinical and neuropsychological evaluations. We performed Trio-based WES analysis and segregation analysis in relevant family members.
A
We describe the developmental trajectory of an adolescent with overlapping features of Rett and Tourette syndromes, carrying
