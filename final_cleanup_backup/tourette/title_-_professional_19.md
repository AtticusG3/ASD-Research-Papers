## Abstract

Antipsychotic treatments require physical health monitoring (PHM), especially among children and young people (CYP).
For CYP aged 5-17, to investigate recorded indications for antipsychotics prescribing and first-treatment durations, and, for psychosis, bipolar disorder, autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and Tourette's syndrome, recorded levels of PHM for CYP with antipsychotics prescriptions and those without.
All CYP registered with QResearch English general practices between 2006 and 2021 were considered. To quantify PHM, 2158 CYP with antipsychotics prescriptions and 22 151 CYP with a condition but no prescriptions were followed for 2 years.
47% (2363) of CYP with antipsychotics prescriptions had a recorded mental health condition of interest (of which 62% were ASD). 19% (921) had no relevant indication. For patients with ASD and Tourette syndrome, top quartiles for initial exposure to antipsychotics were >10 months. Recorded PHM was generally low, with over 50% of CYP showing no blood test during the 2-year follow-up.
Coverage of best practice is uneven across the condition-related national CYP guidelines, and this requires improvement. However, we suspect some apparently poor adherence to best practice also derives from treatment complexities and associated data flows leading to gaps in the encoded general practice data. To audit more exactly clinical practice against guidelines, we propose qualitative studies, targeted to cover the full range of local circumstances, nationally.
General practices should be encouraged to prioritise encoding of all treatment data. Development of one central gold-standard set of recommendations for antipsychotics use could encourage better adherence levels across conditions.---
