## Abstract

We highlight novel and emerging therapies in the treatment of childhood-onset movement disorders. We structured this review by therapeutic entity (small molecule drugs, RNA-targeted therapeutics, gene replacement therapy, and neuromodulation), recognizing that there are two main approaches to treatment: symptomatic (based on phenomenology) and molecular mechanism-based therapy or 'precision medicine' (which is disease-modifying). We highlight reports of new small molecule drugs for Tourette syndrome, Friedreich's ataxia and Rett syndrome. We also discuss developments in gene therapy for aromatic l-amino acid decarboxylase deficiency and hereditary spastic paraplegia, as well as current work exploring optimization of deep brain stimulation and lesioning with focused ultrasound. Childhood-onset movement disorders have traditionally been treated symptomatically based on phenomenology, but focus has recently shifted toward targeted molecular mechanism-based therapeutics. The development of precision therapies is driven by increasing capabilities for genetic testing and a better delineation of the underlying disease mechanisms. We highlight novel and exciting approaches to the treatment of genetic childhood-onset movement disorders while also discussing general challenges in therapy development for rare diseases. We provide a framework for molecular mechanism-based treatment approaches, a summary of specific treatments for various movement disorders, and a clinical trial readiness framework.
