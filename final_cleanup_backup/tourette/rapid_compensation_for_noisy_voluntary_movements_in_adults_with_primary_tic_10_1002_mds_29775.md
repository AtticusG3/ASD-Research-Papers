## Abstract

It has been proposed that tics and premonitory urges in primary tic disorders (PTD), like Tourette syndrome, are a manifestation of sensorimotor noise. However, patients with tics show no obvious movement imprecision in everyday life. One reason could be that patients have strategies to compensate for noise that disrupts performance (ie, noise that is task-relevant). Our goal was to unmask effects of elevated sensorimotor noise on the variability of voluntary movements in patients with PTD. We tested 30 adult patients with PTD (23 male) and 30 matched controls in a reaching task designed to unmask latent noise. Subjects reached to targets whose shape allowed for variability either in movement direction or extent. This enabled us to decompose variability into task-relevant versus less task-relevant components, where the latter should be less affected by compensatory strategies than the former. In alternating blocks, the task-relevant target dimension switched, allowing us to explore the temporal dynamics with which participants adjusted movement variability to changes in task demands. Both groups accurately reached to targets, and adjusted movement precision based on target shape. However, when task-relevant dimensions of the target changed, patients initially produced movements that were more variable than controls, before regaining precision after several reaches. This effect persisted across repeated changes in the task-relevant dimension across the experiment, and therefore did not reflect an effect of novelty, or differences in learning. Our results suggest that patients with PTD generate noisier voluntary movements compared with controls, but rapidly compensate according to current task demands. Â© 2024 The Authors.
