## Abstract

Abstract:
Accurate localization represents a fundamental challenge in
robotic navigation. Traditional methodologies, such as Lidar or QR-code based systems, suffer from inherent scalability and adaptability con straints, particularly in complex environments. In this work, we propose
an innovative localization framework that harnesses flooring characteris tics by employing graph-based representations and Graph Convolutional
Networks (GCNs). Our method uses graphs to represent floor features,
which helps localize the robot more accurately (0.64cm error) and more
efficiently than comparing individual image features. Additionally, this
approach successfully addresses the kidnapped robot problem in every
frame without requiring complex filtering processes. These advancements
open up new possibilities for robotic navigation in diverse environments.---
