## Abstract

The observation of non-linear current-voltage relationships of membrane potential responses in neurons led to the discovery of hyperpolarization-induced membrane conductance. The main underlying hallmark of this conductance was the presence of sag - spontaneous depolarization of membrane potential during constant hyperpolarization in current-clamp mode. Gradually, the presence of underling hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated non-selective cation channels (HCN, I
