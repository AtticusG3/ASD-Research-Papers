## Abstract

Poisoning with Dieffenbachia, a member of the Araceae family, poses serious risks, particularly with respect to oral and airway exposure. This case highlights the critical need for precautionary measures, prompt treatment, and continuous observation following such exposure, emphasizing its significant clinical implications. A 3-year-old Ethiopian boy, who was previously healthy and neurodevelopmentally normal, was brought to the pediatric emergency department after inadvertently chewing and swallowing the parts of Dieffenbachia plant. Initially, he had mild symptoms and signs, including oral and throat irritation and laryngeal and pharyngeal erythema, which were neglected by the parents, leading to respiratory depression, desaturation, seizures, and airway edema on laryngoscope examination. The child's blood counts, renal function, liver enzymes, electrolytes, and blood glucose tests were normal. His case was initially managed in the emergency department with supportive medications, including steroids, antihistamines, acid suppressants, and analgesics. Later, there was a need for immediate intubation and mechanical ventilator support, as the patient developed impending respiratory failure due to upper airway obstruction. The child eventually fully recovered after a few days, with no residual sequelae. It is essential to seek immediate medical attention if individuals are exposed to the toxic Dieffenbachia plant and to closely monitor them for any late symptoms or complications for a minimum of 24 hours, particularly in cases involving the digestive system and airway.
