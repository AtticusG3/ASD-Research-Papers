## Abstract

Intensive care unit (ICU) admissions for patients with substance use disorders (SUDs) pose challenging problems for family members (FMs) and healthcare professionals (HCWs). This qualitative study explores the perceptions and challenges faced by families and HCWs caring for these patients and identifies strategies to improve care quality. Using an inductive grounded theory approach, semistructured interviews were conducted with 38 stakeholders (15 FMs,14 nurses, and 9 doctors) taking care of SUD patients in the ICU, until themes were saturated. Following the Gioia methodology, transcripts were coded to identify themes and aggregate dimensions. Three aggregate dimensions emerged: (1) Affective response spectrum, which included the themes of emotional experiences, care experiences, and causal attribution; (2) Clinical intervention paradigms, with two themes: nonpharmacological and pharmacological management; and (3) Systematic transformation imperatives (institutional policy development and family support enhancements). Healthcare workers initially experienced stigma towards patients, which gradually transformed into empathy over time. Families, contrary to HCWs' expectation, demonstrated candid disclosure in the interest of their patient's well-being. Improving care for ICU patients with SUDs requires a comprehensive approach. Along with addressing the associated underlying stigma and emotional burdens, recommended changes include developing institutional policies and protocols, specialized training, interdisciplinary collaboration, and enhanced family support systems. These findings highlight the need for integrated approaches combining counseling, evidence-based pharmacological management, and systematic transformations in critical care contexts.
