# Rodent research of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder: insights into widely used animal models.

**Authors:** ['Juan CarlosCorona']

## Abstract

Numerous rodent research models of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) have been proposed, including pharmacological, environmental, and genetically generated models. A rodent model for studying ADHD should demonstrate similarities to the disorder by mimicking its three core symptoms (face validity), should align with a theoretically justified pathophysiological basis (construct validity), and should provide insights into unknown aspects of ADHD neurobiology while offering potential new treatments (predictive validity). This review provides an overview of rodent research models, which vary in their pathophysiological alterations, ability to replicate behavioural symptoms, and response to pharmacological treatments. Given this heterogeneity, it remains challenging to determine which rodent model best represents ADHD or its different subtypes. Consequently, validating these models against contemporary medication therapies and testing candidate natural compounds as potential adjuvant treatments is essential. Additionally, combining models induced by neurotoxins, environmental substances, and genetic modifications may help evaluate potential interactions and their impact on ADHD development.
