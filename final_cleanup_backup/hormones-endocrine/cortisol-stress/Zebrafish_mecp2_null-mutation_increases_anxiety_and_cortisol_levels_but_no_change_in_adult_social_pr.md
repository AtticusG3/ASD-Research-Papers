## Abstract

Methyl CpG binding protein 2 (MECP2) is an essential global modulator of transcription and mutations in MECP2 are the most common cause of Rett syndrome, an X-linked neurodevelopmental disorder. Patients diagnosed with Rett syndrome have increased risk for epilepsy as well as problems with anxiety and social communication. Using the zebrafish mecp2 The behavioural tests showed that mecp2 Functional Mecp2 modulated larval locomotion and behavioural anxiety at different ages and adult cortisol levels, but mecp2 null-mutation did not alter adult locomotion and socialization, and developmental sociability and PTZ-induced hyperlocomotion in zebrafish. Given the variability reported in patients and in rodent Mecp2 knockout models, studies using zebrafish can explore vital elements of MECP2's role across development and improve our understanding of neural mechanisms underlying neurodevelopmental disorders.
