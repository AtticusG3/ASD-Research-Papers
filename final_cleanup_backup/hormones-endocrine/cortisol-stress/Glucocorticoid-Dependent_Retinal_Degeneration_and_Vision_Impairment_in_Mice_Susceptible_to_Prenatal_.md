## Abstract

Chronic exposure to prenatal stress can impair neurogenesis and lead to irreversible cognitive and neuropsychiatric abnormalities in offspring. The retina is part of the nervous system; however, the impacts of prenatal stress on retinal neurogenesis and visual function remain unclear. This study examined how elevated prenatal glucocorticoid levels differentially affect retinal development in the offspring of pregnant mice exposed to chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS). Offspring were classified into control, stress-resilient, and stress-susceptible groups based on behavioral tests assessing spatial memory and depression-like behaviors. The stress-susceptible group exhibited significantly altered synaptogenesis, reduced ganglion cell development, decreased retinal thickness, and visiual impairment. These mice also showed a pervasive transformation of retinal astrocytes into a proinflammatory A1-like reactive state, evidenced by increased GFAP and decreased STAT3 expression levels. This astrocyte phenotype shift coincided with disruptions in neurogenesis and synaptic formation. Furthermore, prenatal exposure to exogenous corticosterone confirmed that the effects of prenatal stress are mediated by glucocorticoid-induced retinal neurodegeneration. Our findings suggest that elevated prenatal glucocorticoid levels trigger a series of neurodevelopmental disturbances leading to retinal neurodegeneration and vision impairment. This research highlights the impact of prenatal stress on retinal development and visual health, suggesting new avenues for understanding and potentially mitigating the negative effects of early-life stress on neurodevelopment.
