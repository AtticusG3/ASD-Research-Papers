## Abstract
Treatment-resistant mental health concerns significantly contribute to society in terms of financial costs and individually by creating emotional and functional costs. An important yet little-recognized cause of treatment-resistant mental health conditions is tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) deficiency. BH4 is an essential cofactor for producing serotonin, dopamine, norepinephrine, and nitric oxide-molecules critical to mood and focus. The enzyme GTP Cyclohydrolase 1 (GCH1), produced by a gene of the same name, catalyzes the first step in synthesizing BH4. Variants in this gene have been associated with low BH4 levels, as well as depression and ADHD. The case reports presented in this article illustrate that a partial BH4 deficiency, as conveyed by the
