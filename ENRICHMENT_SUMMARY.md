# Paper Enrichment Summary

**Date:** October 21, 2025  
**Task:** Enrich research papers with full-text content

## What Was Accomplished

### 1. Abstract Restoration (Phase 1 - COMPLETED)
**Status:** ✓ Successfully completed

- **Script Created:** `scripts/fix_abstracts_from_csv.py`
- **Papers Processed:** 985 markdown files
- **Results:**
  - **Already OK:** 674 papers (68%)
  - **Fixed:** 253 papers (26%)
  - **Not Found:** 58 papers (6%)

**Impact:** Restored 253 truncated abstracts from the original CSV data, significantly improving the completeness of our knowledge base.

### 2. Enrichment Analysis Tool (Phase 1 - COMPLETED)
**Status:** ✓ Tool created

- **Script Created:** `scripts/enrich_papers.py`
- **Purpose:** Identifies papers needing full-text enrichment
- **Findings from 50-paper test:**
  - All 50 papers need enrichment (only have abstracts)
  - Papers have DOIs for potential retrieval
  - Many papers are from paywalled journals

## Limitations Discovered

### CSV Data Quality
- The original CSV (`acquired_papers/acquired_papers_20251021_161222.csv`) contains **959 papers**
- Many abstracts in the CSV are themselves truncated
- Example: Paper DOI `10.1093/braincomms/fcaf104` has an 857-character abstract in CSV, but it ends mid-sentence
- This is a limitation of the PubMed/paperscraper data acquisition, not our processing

### Full-Text Access Challenges
1. **arXiv Coverage:** Most papers are from medical journals, not available on arXiv
2. **DOI PDF Downloads:** Failed due to paywall restrictions
3. **Publisher Access:** Would require institutional access or individual paper purchases

## Files Created

### Scripts
- `scripts/fix_abstracts_from_csv.py` - Restores truncated abstracts from CSV
- `scripts/enrich_papers.py` - Framework for full paper enrichment
- `check_doi.py`, `check_abstract_full.py` - Diagnostic tools

### Logs
- `acquired_papers/abstract_fix_log_20251021_173042.yaml` - Complete log of abstract fixes
- Contains details of all 253 fixed papers with DOIs and file paths

## Current State

### Papers with Complete Abstracts
- **927 papers** (674 already good + 253 fixed) now have the most complete abstracts available from PubMed

### Papers Still Needing Work
- **58 papers** couldn't be matched to CSV (may be HTML files or other sources)
- **All ~985 papers** still only have abstracts, lacking full paper sections (Introduction, Methods, Results, Discussion)

## Recommendations for Further Enrichment

### Option 1: Institutional Access
- Partner with a university/research institution
- Use their journal subscriptions to download full PDFs
- Process PDFs to extract structured sections

### Option 2: Open Access Focus
- Filter papers to identify open access publications
- Use tools like Unpaywall API to find free full-text versions
- Prioritize enrichment of freely available papers

### Option 3: Manual Curation
- For high-priority papers (e.g., systematic reviews, meta-analyses)
- Manually obtain and process full texts
- Focus on key papers in each category (tourette, asd, adhd)

### Option 4: Alternative Data Sources
- Europe PMC: Often has full-text XML for open access papers
- BioRxiv/MedRxiv: Preprint servers with full-text access
- Author repositories: Many authors post PDFs on personal/institutional sites

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: The 253 restored abstracts are now available for use
2. **Short-term**: Review the 58 "not found" papers and determine their source
3. **Medium-term**: Implement Option 2 (Open Access focus) for papers that are freely available
4. **Long-term**: Consider Options 1 or 3 for comprehensive full-text coverage

## Technical Notes

- All scripts handle Unicode properly for international characters
- Windows console encoding issues resolved with try/catch blocks
- YAML frontmatter preserved in all file modifications
- Git-ready: All changes logged and traceable

## Success Metrics

- **26% improvement** in abstract completeness
- **0 data loss** - all original content preserved
- **Full audit trail** - every change logged with timestamps
- **Reproducible** - scripts can be run again on new data
