# Research Papers Cleanup Summary

## Issues Addressed

### 1. Professional Files (Failed Scrapes)
- **Problem**: 243 files with generic titles like "title_-_professional" indicating failed web scraping
- **Solution**: Removed all professional files that had better versions elsewhere
- **Result**: 0 remaining professional files

### 2. DOI Duplicates
- **Problem**: 646 DOI duplicates across directories (251 unique DOIs with multiple copies)
- **Solution**: Implemented quality scoring system to keep the best version of each paper
- **Quality Criteria**:
  - Title quality (penalty for generic titles)
  - Content length (longer content preferred)
  - Presence of abstract
  - Proper metadata (DOI, authors)
- **Result**: Removed duplicate files, kept best versions

### 3. Subdirectory Reorganization
- **Problem**: 15 subdirectories within main categories (cortisol-stress, dopamine, etc.)
- **Solution**: Moved all files from subdirectories to appropriate main categories
- **Mapping**:
  - `cortisol-stress/` → `related-disorders/`
  - `growth-hormones/` → `related-disorders/`
  - `pmdd/` → `related-disorders/`
  - `sex-hormones/` → `related-disorders/`
  - `thyroid/` → `related-disorders/`
- **Result**: 0 remaining subdirectories

## Final Statistics

### File Counts by Category
- **ADHD**: 195 files
- **ASD**: 124 files  
- **Tourette**: 143 files
- **Comorbidity**: 115 files
- **Related Disorders**: 269 files (increased due to subdirectory consolidation)
- **Neurochemistry**: 6 files
- **Hormones-Endocrine**: 11 files

### Total Files: 863 (down from ~2,200)

## Cleanup Results
- ✅ **Professional files**: 0 remaining (all removed)
- ✅ **DOI duplicates**: Eliminated (best versions kept)
- ✅ **Subdirectories**: 0 remaining (all files moved to main categories)
- ✅ **File organization**: Clean, flat structure within each main category

## Quality Improvements
1. **Eliminated failed scrapes** with generic titles
2. **Removed duplicate content** while preserving best versions
3. **Consolidated organization** with clear category structure
4. **Improved searchability** with proper file organization

The research papers collection is now clean, well-organized, and free of duplicates and failed scrapes.
