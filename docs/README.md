## Quick Search Tips

### Common Questions and Where to Find Answers

**"Why do I have tics?"**
‚Üí [Dopamine and Tics](patient-guides/biology/dopamine-and-tics.md)

**"What treatments are available?"**
‚Üí [Treatment Options](patient-guides/treatments/)

**"How do I explain this to others?"**
‚Üí [Explaining Your Condition](support/relationships/explaining-condition-to-others.md)

**"How can I manage tics in public?"**

### Search Strategies

- **Use simple language**: "Why do I have tics?" instead of complex medical terms
- **Be specific**: "Managing tics at work" instead of just "Tourette"
- **Try different words**: "Attention problems" if "ADHD" doesn't work
- **Browse by topic**: Sometimes browsing folders is easier than searching
