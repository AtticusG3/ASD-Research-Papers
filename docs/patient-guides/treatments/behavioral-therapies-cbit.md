# Behavioral Therapies for Tics: CBIT and Habit Reversal Training

> **Quick Facts**
> - CBIT (Comprehensive Behavioral Intervention for Tics) is an effective treatment for tics
> - It's based on Habit Reversal Training (HRT), which has been used for decades
> - CBIT doesn't use medication - it teaches you skills to manage tics
> - Research shows CBIT can reduce tic severity by 30-50% in many people

## What is CBIT?

CBIT stands for **Comprehensive Behavioral Intervention for Tics**. It's a therapy program specifically designed to help people with Tourette syndrome and other tic disorders manage their tics.

### The Three Main Parts of CBIT

1. **Awareness Training** - Learning to recognize when a tic is about to happen
2. **Competing Response Training** - Learning to do something else instead of the tic
3. **Social Support** - Getting help from family and friends

## How Does CBIT Work?

### Step 1: Awareness Training

The first step is learning to notice your tics. This might sound easy, but many people with tics don't always realize when they're happening. CBIT helps you:

- **Identify your tics** - Know exactly what your tics look or sound like
- **Recognize warning signs** - Notice the feeling that comes before a tic
- **Track when tics happen** - Understand patterns and triggers

**Example**: If you have a head-shaking tic, you might learn to notice the tension in your neck that comes right before the tic happens.

### Step 2: Competing Response Training

Once you can recognize when a tic is coming, you learn to do something else instead. This "competing response" should be:

- **Incompatible with the tic** - You can't do both at the same time
- **Socially acceptable** - Something that won't draw unwanted attention
- **Easy to do** - Something you can remember and perform

**Examples**:
- Instead of a head shake: Gently press your head against a wall or headrest
- Instead of a vocal tic: Take a slow, deep breath
- Instead of a hand movement: Gently press your hand against your leg

### Step 3: Social Support

Family and friends learn how to help by:
- **Not commenting on tics** - Avoiding attention that might make tics worse
- **Providing gentle reminders** - Helping you use your competing responses
- **Creating supportive environments** - Reducing stress and triggers

## What to Expect from CBIT

### How Long Does It Take?

- **8-12 sessions** typically, spread over 10-12 weeks
- **Weekly sessions** with a trained therapist
- **Daily practice** at home between sessions
- **Gradual improvement** - you'll see changes over time, not immediately

### How Effective Is It?

Research shows that CBIT can:
- **Reduce tic severity** by 30-50% in many people
- **Improve quality of life** by helping people feel more in control
- **Work alongside medication** - can be used with or without medication
- **Provide long-lasting benefits** - skills learned can be used for years

### Who Can Benefit?

CBIT works best for people who:
- **Want to learn** behavioral strategies
- **Can practice** the techniques regularly
- **Have support** from family or friends
- **Are motivated** to work on tic management

## Getting Started with CBIT

### Finding a Therapist

Look for a therapist who:
- **Is trained in CBIT** - Ask specifically about CBIT certification
- **Has experience** with tic disorders
- **Works with your age group** - CBIT is adapted for children, teens, and adults
- **Accepts your insurance** - Check coverage before starting

### What Happens in Sessions?

1. **Assessment** - Understanding your specific tics and triggers
2. **Education** - Learning about tics and how CBIT works
3. **Skill building** - Practicing awareness and competing responses
4. **Problem solving** - Working through challenges and setbacks
5. **Maintenance** - Learning to keep using skills long-term

### Home Practice

Between sessions, you'll practice:
- **Awareness exercises** - Noticing your tics and warning signs
- **Competing responses** - Using your new skills in real situations
- **Tracking progress** - Keeping a simple log of your tics
- **Family involvement** - Getting support from loved ones

## Tips for Success

### Be Patient
- **Progress takes time** - Don't expect immediate results
- **Some days are better** - Tics naturally vary from day to day
- **Keep practicing** - Consistency is more important than perfection

### Stay Positive
- **Celebrate small wins** - Notice when you successfully use a competing response
- **Don't give up** - If one technique doesn't work, try another
- **Remember your goals** - Focus on why you're doing this

### Get Support
- **Involve family** - They can help remind you to practice
- **Connect with others** - Join support groups or online communities
- **Work with your doctor** - Keep them updated on your progress

## Common Challenges and Solutions

### "I Forget to Use My Competing Response"
- **Set reminders** - Use phone alarms or sticky notes
- **Practice in easy situations first** - Start with low-stress times
- **Ask family to help** - They can give gentle reminders

### "My Tics Change or Get Worse"
- **This is normal** - Tics naturally fluctuate
- **Adjust your techniques** - Work with your therapist to modify approaches
- **Don't blame yourself** - Tic changes aren't your fault

### "I Feel Self-Conscious About My Techniques"
- **Practice in private first** - Get comfortable before using in public
- **Remember the goal** - The competing response should be subtle
- **Talk to your therapist** - They can help make techniques more natural

## When to Consider Other Options

CBIT might not be the best choice if you:
- **Have very severe tics** that interfere with daily life
- **Need immediate relief** - CBIT takes time to work
- **Prefer medication** - Some people prefer medical treatment
- **Can't commit to practice** - CBIT requires regular work

## Combining CBIT with Other Treatments

### With Medication
- **Can be used together** - Many people benefit from both
- **May reduce medication needs** - Some people can use lower doses
- **Provides backup skills** - Behavioral techniques work even if medication doesn't

### With Other Therapies
- **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)** - For anxiety or OCD that often co-occurs
- **Family therapy** - To help everyone understand and support
- **School accommodations** - To create supportive learning environments

## Key Terms Explained

- **CBIT**: Comprehensive Behavioral Intervention for Tics
- **HRT**: Habit Reversal Training - the foundation of CBIT
- **Competing Response**: An action that prevents or reduces a tic
- **Awareness Training**: Learning to notice tics and their warning signs
- **Tic Suppression**: The ability to temporarily hold back a tic
