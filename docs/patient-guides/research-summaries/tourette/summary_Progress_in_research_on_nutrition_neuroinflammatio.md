# What This Research Means: Progress in research on nutrition, neuroinflammation and dopaminergic alteration...

> **What This Is**
> This is a patient-friendly explanation of a research study. We've taken the scientific findings and explained them in everyday language.

## What the Study Found

**Finding 1:** cal tics. Dysfunction of the dopamine system plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of TD. Recent findings indicate that deep brain stimulation, by modulating striatal dopamine release, substantially alleviates tic symptoms. Neuroimaging studies have shown increased dopamine transporter binding and decreased serot
