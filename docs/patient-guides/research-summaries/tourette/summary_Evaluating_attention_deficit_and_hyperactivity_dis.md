# What This Research Means: Evaluating attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder (ADHD): a review of curr...

> **What This Is**
> This is a patient-friendly explanation of a research study. We've taken the scientific findings and explained them in everyday language.

## What the Study Found

**Finding 1:** ent ADHD) and those who reported ADHD symptoms in adulthood, regardless of the childhood onset. The results revealed that the worldwide prevalence for persistent adult ADHD was 2.58% and symptomatic adult ADHD was reported to be 6.76% ([Song et al., 2021](#ref164)). While persistent adult ADHD reflects accurate e

**Finding 2:** ty, mood or substance use disorders ([Anbarasan et al., 2020](#ref12)). Results from a longitudinal study indicated that ADHD is a challenging disorder with a high rate of comorbidity ([Reale et al., 2017](#ref136)). Most comorbid cases in ADHD include conduct disorder (CD), oppositional defiant disorder (ODD), l
