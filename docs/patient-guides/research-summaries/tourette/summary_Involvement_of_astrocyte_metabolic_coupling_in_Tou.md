# What This Research Means: Involvement of astrocyte metabolic coupling in Tourette syndrome pathogenesis...

> **What This Is**
> This is a patient-friendly explanation of a research study. We've taken the scientific findings and explained them in everyday language.

## What the Study Found

**Finding 1:** lved in glycolysis and glutamate metabolism through which astrocytes support synaptic function. Our results indicate for the first time that the process of astrocyte-neuron metabolic coupling may be an important contributor to Tourette syndrome pathogenesis. ## Introduction Tourette syndrome is a childhood-onset ne

**Finding 2:** he 33 genes on the gene-set association ([Table 2](#tbl2) and [Supplementary Table S6](#sup1)). The results show that none of the individual genes would have survived correction for multiple testing, suggesting that the association of the ANMC gene set is not driven by a single gene but rather is due to the com

**Finding 3:** ated to Tourette syndrome or are only important in specific subtypes of Tourette syndrome. A recent study demonstrated that Tourette syndrome is polygenic and likely influenced by hundreds, possibly thousands, of genetic variants with small effects, and that >75% of Tourette syndrome heritability is captured by comm

## What This Means for You

**If you have Tourette syndrome:**
- This research may help explain why certain treatments work
