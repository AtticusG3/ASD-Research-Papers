## Abstract

Abstract:
Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) involves diverse neurodevelopmental syndromes with significant deficits in communication, motor behaviours, emotional and social comprehension. Often, individuals with ASD exhibit comorbid conditions, one of the most prevalent being depression characterized by a persistent change in mood and diminished interest in previously enjoyable activities. Due to communicative challenges and lack of appropriate assessments in individuals with ASD, comorbid depression can often go undiagnosed during routine clinical examinations, which may aggravate their problems. The current literature on comorbid depression in adults with ASD is limited. Therefore, understanding the neural basis of the comorbid psychopathology of depression in ASD is crucial for identifying objective brain-based markers for its timely and effective management. Towards this end, using structural MRI and phenotypic data from the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange II (ABIDE II) repository, we specifically examined the pattern of relationship regional grey matter volume (rGMV) has with comorbid depression and autism severity within regions of a priori interest in adults with ASD (n = 44). The severity of comorbid depression correlated negatively with the rGMV of the right thalamus. Additionally, a significant interaction was evident between the severity of comorbid depression and core ASD symptoms towards explaining the rGMV in the left cerebellum crus II. The whole-brain regional rGMV differences between ASD and typically developed (TD, n = 39) adults remained inconclusive. The results further the understanding of the neurobiological underpinnings of comorbid depression in adults with ASD and are relevant in exploring structural neuroimaging-based biomarkers in the same cohort.
