## Abstract

Although the majority of doctorally prepared nurses work in academia, a percentage choose clinical work. Knowledge about the contribution of doctorally prepared clinical nurses (DPCNs) is growing, but further exploration is required. This research explored the value that DPCNs provide to nursing practice and healthcare.
Using an interpretive descriptive approach, individual interviews were conducted with 18 DPCNs. Data was collected between 2021 and 2022. Reflexive thematic analysis informed the data analysis.
Five key mechanisms drive DPCNs' value: being a knowledge expert; an enhanced approach to practice; increased credibility/prestige of the doctorate; valuable conversations; and new opportunities and collaborations. Challenges to value contribution were also highlighted, including identity issues; negative external perceptions; fragmented mentorship; no post-doctoral pathway; and little recognition from nursing leaders.
Doctorally prepared clinical nurses bring significant value to nursing and healthcare through distinct mechanisms that should be nurtured and strengthened.
Doctorally prepared clinical nurses add important value to healthcare. However, these nurses are under-utilised and require support to enhance their value contribution.
Identifying the mechanisms driving value provides a unique opportunity to acknowledge, support and enhance the value provided by DPCNs. The research will be impactful for nurses considering doctoral study, nursing leaders and healthcare managers.
This research is reported following SRQR guidelines.
This study did not include patient or public involvement in its design, conduct or reporting.

Abstract AbstractAim:Although the majority of doctorally prepared nurses work in academia, a percentage choose clinical work. Knowledge about the contribution of doctorally prepared clinical nurses (DPCNs) is growing, but further exploration is required. This research explored the value that DPCNs provide to nursing practice and healthcare.Design and methods:Using an interpretive descriptive approach, individual interviews were conducted with 18 DPCNs. Data was collected between 2021 and 2022. Reflexive thematic analysis informed the data analysis.Results:Five key mechanisms drive DPCNs' value: being a knowledge expert; an enhanced approach to practice; increased credibility/prestige of the doctorate; valuable conversations; and new opportunities and collaborations. Challenges to value contribution were also highlighted, including identity issues; negative external perceptions; fragmented mentorship; no post-doctoral pathway; and little recognition from nursing leaders.Conclusion:Doctorally prepared clinical nurses bring significant value to nursing and healthcare through distinct mechanisms that should be nurtured and strengthened.Implications for practice:Doctorally prepared clinical nurses add important value to healthcare. However, these nurses are under-utilised and require support to enhance their value contribution.Impact:Identifying the mechanisms driving value provides a unique opportunity to acknowledge, support and enhance the value provided by DPCNs.
