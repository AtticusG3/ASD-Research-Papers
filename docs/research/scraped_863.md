## Abstract

Our aim is to analyze the relevance of the mentor-child paradigm with a robot for individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorders, and the adaptations required. This method could allow a more reliable evaluation of the socio-cognitive abilities of individuals with autism, which may have been underestimated due to pragmatic factors.
