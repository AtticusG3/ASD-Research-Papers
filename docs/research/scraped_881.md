## Abstract

Abstract:
To easily obtain the knowledge about autism spectrum disorder and help its early screening and diagnosis, we create AsdKB, a Chinese knowledge base on autism spectrum disorder. The knowledge base is built on top of various sources, including 1) the disease knowledge from SNOMED CT and ICD-10 clinical descriptions on mental and behavioural disorders, 2) the diagnostic knowledge from DSM-5 and different screening tools recommended by social organizations and medical institutes, and 3) the expert knowledge on professional physicians and hospitals from the Web. AsdKB contains both ontological and factual knowledge, and is accessible as Linked Data at
this https URL
. The potential applications of AsdKB are question answering, auxiliary diagnosis, and expert recommendation, and we illustrate them with a prototype which can be accessed at
