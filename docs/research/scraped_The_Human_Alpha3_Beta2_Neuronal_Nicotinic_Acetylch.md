## Abstract

Diverse neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) subtypes are expressed in hippocampal interneurons. Single-cell analysis of mRNA expression previously revealed prominent co-expression of the α3 and β2 subunits within rat interneurons in the CA1 region. Although the α3 subunit (traditionally expressed together with β4) is usually associated with the peripheral nervous system, its significant co-expression with the β2 subunit in hippocampal interneurons suggests a distinct, potentially novel central nervous system nAChR subtype. We demonstrate that the human α3 and β2 subunits injected into

Abstract AbstractDiverse neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) subtypes are expressed in hippocampal interneurons. Single-cell analysis of mRNA expression previously revealed prominent co-expression of the α3 and β2 subunits within rat interneurons in the CA1 region. Although the α3 subunit (traditionally expressed together with β4) is usually associated with the peripheral nervous system, its significant co-expression with the β2 subunit in hippocampal interneurons suggests a distinct, potentially novel central nervous system nAChR subtype. We demonstrate that the human α3 and β2 subunits injected intoXenopus laevisoocytes can assemble into at least two functionally distinct subtypes of nAChRs based on different subunit stoichiometries. These subtypes exhibit similar reversal potentials but differ significantly in their desensitization kinetics and acetylcholine (ACh) affinities. The response obtained from a 1:5 α3:β2 mRNA injection ratio shows a higher affinity for ACh and significantly greater desensitization during prolonged ACh application compared to the response obtained from a 5:1 α3:β2 mRNA injection ratio. The identification of distinct functional α3β2 subtypes, characterized by differential desensitization kinetics and ACh affinity, could represent novel targets for the potential development of highly selective cognitive therapeutics for conditions such as Alzheimer's disease, autism spectrum disorder, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, where hippocampal nAChRs are implicated.Keywords:acetylcholine; hippocampus; nicotinic.
