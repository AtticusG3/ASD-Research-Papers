## Abstract

Tourette disorder (TD) is poorly understood, despite affecting 1/160 children. A lack of animal models possessing construct, face, and predictive validity hinders progress in the field. We used CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing to generate mice with mutations orthologous to human de novo variants in two high-confidence Tourette genes,

A lack of animal models possessing construct, face, and predictive validity hinders progress in the field. We used CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing to generate mice with mutations orthologous to human de novo variants in two high-confidence Tourette genes,CELSR3andWWC1. Mice with human mutations inCelsr3andWwc1exhibit cognitive and/or sensorimotor behavioral phenotypes consistent with TD. Sensorimotor gating deficits, as measured by acoustic prepulse inhibition, occur in both male and femaleCelsr3TD models.Wwc1mice show reduced prepulse inhibition only in females. Repetitive motor behaviors, common toCelsr3mice and more pronounced in females, include vertical rearing and grooming. Sensorimotor gating deficits and rearing are attenuated by aripiprazole, a partial agonist at dopamine type II receptors. Unsupervised machine learning reveals numerous changes to spontaneous motor behavior and less predictable patterns of movement. Continuous fixed-ratio reinforcement shows thatCelsr3TD mice have enhanced motor responding and reward learning. Electrically evoked striatal dopamine release, tested in one model, is greater. Brain development is otherwise grossly normal without signs of striatal interneuron loss. Altogether, mice expressing human mutations in high-confidence TD genes exhibit face and predictive validity. Reduced prepulse inhibition and repetitive motor behaviors are core behavioral phenotypes and are responsive to aripiprazole. Enhanced reward learning and motor responding occur alongside greater evoked dopamine release. Phenotypes can also vary by sex and show stronger affection in females, an unexpected finding considering males are more frequently affected in TD.Keywords:Tourette disorder; behavior; mouse models; neuroanatomical findings.---
