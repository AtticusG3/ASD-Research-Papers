## Abstract

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are emerging as crucial elements in the regulation of gene expression, playing a significant role in the underlying neurobiology of a wide range of neuropsychiatric disorders. This review examines the intricate involvement of miRNAs in neuropsychiatric disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), Huntington's disease (HD), Fragile X syndrome (FXS), autism spectrum disorder (ASD), attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), Tourette syndrome (TS), schizophrenia (SCZ), and mood disorders. This review highlights how miRNA dysregulation can illuminate the molecular pathways of these diseases and potentially serve as biomarkers for early diagnosis and prognosis. Specifically, miRNAs' ability to target genes critical to the pathology of neurodegenerative diseases, their role in the development of trinucleotide repeat and neurodevelopmental disorders, and their distinctive patterns in SCZ and mood disorders are discussed. The review also stresses the value of miRNAs in precision neuropsychiatry, where they could predict treatment outcomes and aid in disease management. Furthermore, the study of conserved miRNAs in model organisms like Drosophila underscores their broad utility and provides deeper mechanistic insights into their biological functions. This comprehensive examination of miRNAs across various conditions advocates for their integration into clinical practice, promising advancements in personalized healthcare for neurological and psychiatric conditions.
