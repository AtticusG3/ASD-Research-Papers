Below the answers to her queries.Results: for the paragraph starting..."Bazaibal-Carvallo and colleagues..." - it would help to describe what "self-inflicted damage" is - and how that differs from SIBActually, in the paper, these were described as “self-directed SIB” and we have changed the phrasing accordingly. We have also added a half sentence regarding tic-related SIB, hoping this will clarify."A huge electronic..." Is it appropriate to say the "risk of atopy was higher in children" ? I imagine it would be more appropriate (unless methodology was described further) to say "rates of atopy were higher..."We agree and have changed the phrasing accordingly."Rickets and colleagues" - it would help to comment on what the authors mean by "important predictors" - significance? magnitude? what p-value if that's the correct statistic?Thepvalue for female sex was < 0.002 and we have added this number to the manuscript."Li and colleagues" - looks like PU isn't defined until the below paragraph - would write out premonitory urges in this oneAgreed and done."Langelage and colleagues" - it's hard to follow what the author means by "positive association between urge and tic" and "reverse association"Reverse association means negative association. We have added this in brackets.In the comorbidities section, given that there are so many articles focusing on sleep, I would make sleep its own categoryWe’d rather stick to this format for historical reasons."Ricketts and colleagues published..." - Would recommend defining chronotypeAgreed and done."Another study focused on decision-making processes" - I had trouble following this summary, and would recommend re-writing/re-phrasing for clarity purposesAgreed and done."Fremer and colleagues" - was confused what the authors were referring to with "structural deficits" and "unconscious intrapsychic conflicts" for that matterAgreed and done."Trau and colleagues" - Starting "Similarly, the Calgary group tested which symptoms" through "self-injurious actions" would benefit from being moved to the below paragraph as those findings are more consistent with teh subsequent paragraph.Agreed and done."Grotzinger and colleagues..." - Difficulty understanding this summary, would re-write/edit, especially from "TS, anorexia nervosa" through "alcohol use." Seems like the last sentence of the paragraph contradicts an earlier sentence in the paragraphAgreed and done."Abdulkadir and colleagues" - Clarify what PRS meansPRSPolygenic risk score, done."A fascinating preliminary..." - Should the authors say "in TS" following the clause "across all task conditions" ?Yes, absolutely."Remote delivery of BT" - starting with "However, treatment response rates..." - paragraph became hard to followAgreed and done."A few studies on face-to-face" would change "conducted" to "published" since the studies weren't conducted in 2022.Agreed and changed."Lastly, interest in investigating" ... would change "later" to "recent;" would make use of PU vs premonitory urges consistent; would clarify "instance urge severity"Agreed and changed."Abi-Jaoude and colleagues" - would help to list some secondary outcome measuresAgreed and changed."Lin and colleagues" - unclear how the behavioral therapy performed in comparisonAgreed and done."The Tourette Association of America" - would make sure to say "reported" when describing some of the self-reported statisticsDone."A longitudinal clinical cohort study..." - would edit for grammarDone."Atkinson-Clement and colleagues" - grammar bingeing "Severity of tics..."Done.Conclusions:It actually seemed like the focus on FTLBs this year was a lot less than the prior yearYes indeed.Would change wording of "this wave of functional patients will eventually abate" as is sounds more negatively judgmental than I believe the authors intended, and additionally, really wasn't a large focus on the summaries this year. Similarly, I would strongly recommend eliminating the sentence referring to "toxic influence of social media" as that was not a focus of many/any articles that were reviewed, and it sounds unduly biased against social media when the literature is less clear.Here, we respectfully disagree. There is no negative judgement in the hope that the wave of FTMB will abate, to us it is simply a matter of fact statement. Any disorder which prevalence decreases is a cause for rejoicing. As to the toxicity of social media, we made sure to add the adverb “sometimes”. Also, we think the data on the impact of social media on emotional well being, especially in children and adolescents, are actually becoming clearer, cf. Sinclair-McBride K, Rich M. Social adolescents, social media, and social emotional development. Lancet Child Adolesc Health. 2023 Oct;7(10):673-675. doi: 10.1016/S2352-4642(23)00177-3. Epub 2023 Aug 8. PMID: 37567198.Final thought is that I would recommend considering a more standardized approach to capturing the array of articles that are published each year, as it is likely that many fall through the cracks for a variety of reasons.We would welcome some suggestions as to how this approach might look. We have been scanning the same databases for years, essentially PubMed bit also others, and hope we haven’t missed much relevant work this way. The problem rather is to make a choice and we hope, as we state in our introductory paragraph, not to offend anybody by not citing their work. However, this article is growing in length from year to year and we are rather afraid it might become undigestible at some point. In any case, we agree that it is a subjective choice and that therefore there will always be room for debate.View moreView lessCompeting InterestsNo competing interests were disclosed.replyRespondReport a concern Author Response16 Nov 2023Andreas Hartmann,Department of Neurology, Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital, Assistance Publique - Hopitaux de Paris, Paris, 75013, FranceWe thank Dr Leckman for his positive evaluation of our annual review.View moreView lessCompeting InterestsNo competing interests were disclosed.replyRespondReport a concern---
