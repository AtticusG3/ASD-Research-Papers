## Abstract

Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is considered off-label and investigational in pediatric populations with some exceptions. There are limited data on the relative rates of complications after DBS across different indications and targets in children. This study aimed to evaluate the safety of DBS surgery for children with movement disorders (MDs; dystonia, chorea, or tic disorders), drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE), or neurodevelopmental disorders, namely, self-injurious behavior (SIB).
## Results
A total of 130 children and youth (mean age 12.2 ± 4.2; range 3-18) years and weighing 12.5-126.6 kg underwent DBS. The most common indication was MD (77, 59.2%), followed by DRE (47, 36.2%) and SIB (6, 4.6%). Major complications occurred in 11.5%, with a greater likelihood in MD (n = 12, 15.6%) compared with DRE (n = 2, 4.3%; odds ratio [OR] 3.55, 95% CI 2.66-4.73,
DBS-associated complications were low across multiple pediatric indications and targets, with MD associated with higher risk of major complications. Limitations include a focus on surgical postoperative complications and not stimulation-related adverse outcomes. These findings demonstrate the safety profile of DBS in children in a large cohort.
