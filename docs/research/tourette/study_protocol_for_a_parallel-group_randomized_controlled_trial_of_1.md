## Abstract

Tourette syndrome (TS) and chronic motor or vocal tic disorder (CTD) are neurodevelopmental disorders associated with functional impairment and reduced quality of life. Behavioral therapy (BT) is an effective treatment, but lack of experienced practitioners makes it hard for patients to receive appropriate help. One approach to bridge the gap between demand and availability is to offer the treatment remotely over the internet with minimal support from a therapist.
## Results
This is the first randomized controlled trial to evaluate therapist-guided ERP-based I-BT for adults with TS/CTD. The study has been approved by the Swedish Ethical Review Authority (EPM 2023-06541-01). The hypotheses were pre-registered before the start of the data collection. Results from all analyses will be reported according to the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials statement for non-pharmacological trials (CONSORT) and Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards (CHEERS). The participants in the control condition will have the opportunity to receive I-BT after the data from the first follow-up is collected. The study will be published in open access and the results will be shared with service user organizations. At the moment of submission, the study has recruited 87 out of 110 planned participants and the recruitment is expected to be completed in February 2025.
