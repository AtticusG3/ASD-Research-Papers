## Abstract

Children's mental health issues have always been a focus of our attention. However, there has been limited exploration on how to conduct rapid, low-cost, and effective screening in large samples of children.This study collected data from all fifth-grade students in a district of Beijing, China, from 2018 to 2022. First, information from the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) was gathered for all samples. For children whose scores on any CBCL dimension exceeded the normal range, semi-structured interviews were conducted to clarify diagnoses. Subsequently, a random forest model was constructed to assess screening effectiveness.Among 104,276 participants, only 2.24% of children were diagnosed with a mental disorder following the two-step screening procedure, which is lower than the prevalence reported in epidemiological surveys. Among all diagnosed mental disorders, the highest prevalence was observed for Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), at 1.48%. Additionally, 5.49% of the patients exhibited comorbidities, with the most common being ADHD comorbid with ASD. Regarding specific disorders, the comorbidity rate for tic disorders (TD) was the highest at 34.78%. A random forest model was constructed to predict ADHD, depressive disorder, and ASD. The model performed exceptionally well in predicting normal children with specificity greater than 0.9; however, its predictive performance for patients was poor, with sensitivity below 0.2 and precision below 0.3.The two-step CBCL screening underestimates the true prevalence of mental disorders but shows high predictive accuracy for negative cases. Applying random forest to pre-exclude negatives in large samples can reduce screening costs and improve efficiency by focusing interviews on predicted positives.

We found that the CBCL, when applied in a two-step screening procedure, can effectively exclude negative samples in large populations, thereby reducing the screening workload. However, its sensitivity for identifying positive samples was slightly insufficient in this sample. Our findings provide a reference framework and practical guidance for large-scale screening.Publisher’s NoteSpringer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.Zhongliang Jiang and Wenyan Zhang are considered joint first author.Supplementary InformationBelow is the link to the electronic supplementary material.Supplementary Material 1 (DOCX. 14.0 KB)Rights and permissionsSpringer Nature or its licensor (e.g. a society or other partner) holds exclusive rights to this article under a publishing agreement with the author(s) or other rightsholder(s); author self-archiving of the accepted manuscript version of this article is solely governed by the terms of such publishing agreement and applicable law.Reprints and permissionsAbout this articleCite this articleJiang, Z., Zhang, W., Liu, Z.et al.Screening Results and Performance of the CBCL Using a two-step Procedure for Mental Disorders in Chinese Children and Adolescents: a five-year Survey.Psychiatr Q(2025). https://doi.org/10.1007/s11126-025-10221-yDownload citationReceived:29 July 2025Accepted:24 September 2025Published:14 October 2025DOI:https://doi.org/10.1007/s11126-025-10221-yShare this articleAnyone you share the following link with will be able to read this content:Get shareable linkSorry, a shareable link is not currently available for this article.Copy shareable link to clipboardProvided by the Springer Nature SharedIt content-sharing initiativeAccess this articleLog in via an institutionSubscribe and saveSpringer+from $39.99 /MonthStarting from 10 chapters or articles per monthAccess and download chapters and articles from more than 300k books and 2,500 journalsCancel anytimeView plansBuy NowBuy article PDF USD 39.95Price excludes VAT (USA)Tax calculation will be finalised during checkout.Instant access to the full article PDF.Institutional subscriptionsAdvertisement Clinical Subtypes in Children with Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder According to Their Child Behavior Checklist ProfileArticle12 March 2020 The prevalence of psychiatric disorders among students aged 6~ 16 years old in central Hunan, ChinaArticleOpen access28 July 2018 Prevalence and comorbidity of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in Chinese school-attending students aged 6–16: a national surveyArticleOpen access13 April 2025---
