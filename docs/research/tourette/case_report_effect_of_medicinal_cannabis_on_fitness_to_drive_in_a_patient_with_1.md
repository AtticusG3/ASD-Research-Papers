## Abstract

Tourette Syndrome (TS) is a childhood onset chronic disorder in which motor and vocal tics co-occur. Cannabinoids are a potential therapeutic option for otherwise treatment resistant patients. However, there is an ongoing debate regarding potential side effects. This is particularly important in relation to activities being necessary for daily life such as driving a car.
## Results
This case study demonstrates that patients with TS plus comorbid ADHD may be fit to drive even after intake of high doses of MC. In any case, however, every driver, who uses MC, is obliged to check fitness to drive before driving a vehicle.
