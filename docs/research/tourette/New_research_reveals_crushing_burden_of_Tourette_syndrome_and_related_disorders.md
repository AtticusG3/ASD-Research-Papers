## New research reveals crushing burden of Tourette syndrome and related disorders

2025-06-01T14:08:00+10:00

## Bullying and ridicule

Respondents consistently reported they had been bullied and ridiculed at school and work by peers, teachers and co-workers.


“Our report shows three out of four children had been ridiculed or bullied by other students, while a third had been ridiculed or bullied by teachers,” Dr Licari said.


“Two out of five affected adults reported they were unable to work due to the severity of their tics – leading to financial strain – while similar numbers had experienced discrimination in the workplace, including ridicule or bullying by co-workers.”


The report also highlighted difficulties obtaining a diagnosis, accessing treatments, and obtaining disability funding. Three out of four respondents who had applied for National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS) funding had had their applications declined.


“There are currently no national standards or clinical practice guidelines outlining recommended therapies or interventions following the diagnosis of a tic disorder,” Professor Eapen said.


“One in four respondents reported they had waited more than two years to receive a diagnosis, with some waiting up to four years, while a third of those who did receive a diagnosis received no recommendations for services or interventions.


“Families are facing a long and difficult path to diagnosis, then an even trickier path to find appropriate treatments. This places an enormous strain on families, leading to significant mental health impacts.”

## Report recommendations

The report included seven key recommendations, including funding to develop a National Clinical Guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of tic disorders; funding for resources and training programs for health professionals, educators and school staff, employers and policymakers; targeted funding for enhanced support for individuals with tic disorders and their families, including mental health services; and clear standards for the way students with tic disorders should be supported in school settings.


The report’s authors acknowledged that, as with most surveys, those who were most affected and passionate about an issue were the most likely to respond.


“While this means our survey cannot perfectly reflect the experiences of the entire tic community in Australia, it offers valuable community-driven data highlighting widespread challenges, and this fits with what we see regularly in clinical practice,” Dr Licari said.


Impact for Tourette’s was undertaken in collaboration with national advocacy organisation Tourette Syndrome Association of Australia (TSAA).


“Despite its prevalence, Tourette syndrome remains under-recognised, often overlooked, or misdiagnosed,” TSAA President Mandy Maysey said.


“Many individuals with Tourette syndrome go through life without receiving an accurate diagnosis, leaving them without appropriate support. They also often face discrimination due to a lack of awareness around their symptoms by everyone from teachers to health providers and employers.”


Ms Maysey said the study had provided valuable insights into the challenges, sacrifices, financial burdens and emotional stresses experienced by people affected by tic disorders, and their families.


The Impact for Tourette’s survey and report were supported by internal funding awards at The Kids Research Institute Australia, including the Julie Bishop Award for emerging women in science, presented to Dr Licari in 2023, and an Embrace Award presented to Dr Licari and Professor Eapen in 2024.
