## Abstract

Psoriasis is associated with increased risk of depression. Although cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is an evidence-based treatment, access remains limited.
To evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of a smartphone-delivered, coach-led CBT program for depression among individuals with psoriasis.
## Results
Of 30 participants, 63.3% completed ≥4/8 modules and 43.3% completed ≥6/8 modules. Mean CSQ-8 and uMARS scores were 27.2 (SD 4.5) and 4.0 (SD 0.7), respectively, supporting high satisfaction. Statistically and clinically significant improvements were observed in PHQ-9 (mean change -4.4; Cohen's d = 0.92), GAD-7 (-2.8; d = 0.63), and Skindex-16 symptoms (5.0; d = 0.78), emotions (10.0; d = 0.95), and functioning (6.4; Cohen's d = 0.71) subscales as well as the Psoriasis Symptom Inventory (3.1; d = 0.43).
This study supports the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of smartphone-delivered CBT for individuals with psoriasis and depressive symptoms. Given the scalability of this model, future randomized trials are warranted to assess broader effectiveness in dermatology care settings.
