## Abstract

BackgroundMany individuals with chronic tic disorders endorse sensory dysregulation. Whether sensory dysregulation is linked with co-occurring conditions or associated with greater tic severity, urge severity, or severity of co-occurring conditions in this population is unknown. Characterizing sensory dysregulation in chronic tic disorders may help illustrate the mechanisms underlying development of chronic tic disorders.MethodsWe enrolled 40 subjects ages 6 to 17 with chronic tic disorders. Sensory profiles were determined by the parent-proxy reported Short Sensory Profile 2 or the self-reported Adolescent/Adult Sensory Profile. Symptom severities for anxiety, tics, obsessive-compulsive disorder, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and premonitory urge were assessed. Anxiety disorder diagnoses were determined using the Anxiety and Related Disorders-IV Child and Parent Interview. Obsessive-compulsive disorder and ADHD diagnoses were determined by clinician interview. Relationships between abnormal sensory profiles and co-occurring conditions were assessed with the Fisher exact test. Relationships between sensory profiles and continuous variables were assessed using Student 2-sided

Sensory profiles were determined by the parent-proxy reported Short Sensory Profile 2 or the self-reported Adolescent/Adult Sensory Profile. Symptom severities for anxiety, tics, obsessive-compulsive disorder, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and premonitory urge were assessed. Anxiety disorder diagnoses were determined using the Anxiety and Related Disorders-IV Child and Parent Interview. Obsessive-compulsive disorder and ADHD diagnoses were determined by clinician interview. Relationships between abnormal sensory profiles and co-occurring conditions were assessed with the Fisher exact test. Relationships between sensory profiles and continuous variables were assessed using Student 2-sidedttest and linear regression.ResultsGreater total sensory profile scores in youth with chronic tic disorders were associated with worse tic (P= .001) and premonitory urge severities (P= .002). Participants with abnormal sensory avoidance and sensitivity had greater obsessive-compulsive disorder (avoidance:P< .001; sensitivity:P= .002), ADHD (avoidance:P= .01; sensitivity:P< .001), and anxiety (Screen for Child Anxiety-Related Emotional Disorders [SCARED]-Parent avoidance:P= .009; SCARED-Parent sensitivity:P= .01; SCARED-Child avoidance:P= .004; SCARED-Child sensitivity:P< .001) symptom severity compared with participants with normal sensory avoidance and sensitivity.ConclusionSensory dysregulation, specifically abnormal sensory avoidance and sensory sensitivity, is common in youth with chronic tic disorders and associated with increased severity of chronic tic disorders-related symptoms and co-occurring conditions.Keywords:ADHD; Tourette syndrome; anxiety.---
