## Abstract

The gene CELSR3 (Cadherin EGF LAG Seven-pass-G-type Receptor 3) has been recently recognized as a high-confidence risk factor for Tourette syndrome (TS). Additionally, Celsr3 mutant mice have been reported to exhibit TS-related behaviors and increased dopamine release in the striatum. Building on these findings, we further characterized the neurobehavioral and molecular profile of Celsr3 mutant mice to understand better the biological mechanisms connecting the deficiency of this gene and TS-related phenotypes. Our analyses confirmed that Celsr3 mutant mice displayed grooming stereotypies and tic-like jerks, as well as sensorimotor gating deficits, which were opposed by TS therapies. Spatial transcriptomic analyses revealed widespread extracellular matrix abnormalities in the striatum of Celsr3 mutants. Single-nucleus transcriptomics also showed significant upregulation of the Drd3 gene, encoding the dopamine D

Additionally,Celsr3mutant mice have been reported to exhibit TS-related behaviors and increased dopamine release in the striatum. Building on these findings, we further characterized the neurobehavioral and molecular profile ofCelsr3mutant mice to understand better the biological mechanisms connecting the deficiency of this gene and TS-related phenotypes. Our analyses confirmed thatCelsr3mutant mice displayed grooming stereotypies and tic-like jerks, as well as sensorimotor gating deficits, which were opposed by TS therapies. Spatial transcriptomic analyses revealed widespread extracellular matrix abnormalities in the striatum ofCelsr3mutants. Single-nucleus transcriptomics also showed significant upregulation of theDrd3gene, encoding the dopamine D3receptor, in striosomal D1-positive neurons. In situ hybridization and immunofluorescence confirmed dysregulated D3receptor expression, with lower levels in presynaptic striatal fibers and higher levels in striatal D1-positive neurons. Activating and blocking D3receptors amplified or decreased tic-like jerks and stereotypies inCelsr3-deficient mice, respectively. These findings suggest that modifications of D3receptor distribution contribute to the tic-like responses associated withCelsr3deficiency.Access through your institutionBuy or subscribeThis is a preview of subscription content,access via your institutionAccess optionsAccess through your institutionSubscribe to this journalReceive 12 print issues and online access$259.00 per yearonly $21.58 per issueLearn moreBuy this articlePurchase on SpringerLinkInstant access to full article PDFBuy nowPrices may be subject to local taxes which are calculated during checkoutAdditional access options:Log inLearn about institutional subscriptionsRead our FAQsContact customer supportFig. 1: Adolescent and juvenileCelsr3heterozygous (HZ) mice show spontaneous behavioral alterations related to Tourette syndrome (TS).Fig. 2: Tourette syndrome therapies are effective against the spontaneous tic-like behaviors ofCelsr3heterozygous (HZ) mice.Fig. 3: Spatial Transcriptomic Analyses of the Striatum inCelsr3heterozygous (HZ) mice reveal inflammatory alterations and reductions in collagen-containing matrix.Fig. 4: Single-nucleus transcriptomic analyses of neuron-associated clusters ofCelsr3heterozygous (HZ) and wild-type (WT) reveal alteration in microtubule organization and signaling in select neuronal clusters.Fig. 5:Celsr3heterozygous (HZ) mice exhibit alterations in striatal D3dopamine receptors.Fig. 6: D3dopamine receptor activation worsens tic-like behaviors inCelsr3heterozygous (HZ) mice, while antagonism reduces them.Similar content being viewed by othersHow changes in dopamine D2 receptor levels alter striatal circuit function and motivationArticle12 August 2021Translational profiling of mouse dopaminoceptive neurons reveals region-specific gene expression, exon usage, and striatal prostaglandin E2 modulatory effectsArticle18 February 2022Ventral striatal islands of Calleja neurons bidirectionally mediate depression-like behaviors in miceArticleOpen access28 October 2023Data availabilityAll data needed to evaluate the conclusions in the paper are present in the paper and/or the Supplementary Materials.
