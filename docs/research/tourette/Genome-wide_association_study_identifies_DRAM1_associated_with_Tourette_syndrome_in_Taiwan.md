## Abstract

Tourette syndrome (TS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by motor and vocal tics. Several susceptibility loci associated with TS have been identified previously in populations of European descent using genome-wide association studies (GWAS). However, the exact pathogenic mechanism underlying TS is unknown; additionally, the results of previous GWAS for TS were based on Western populations, which may not translate to other populations. Therefore, we conducted a GWAS in Taiwanese patients with TS and chronic tic disorders (CTDs), with an aim to elucidate the genetic basis and potential risk factors for TS in this population. GWAS was performed on a Taiwanese TS/CTDs cohort with a sample size of 1007 patients with TS and 25,522 ancestry-matched controls. Additionally, polygenic risk score was calculated and assessed. Genome-wide significant locus, rs12313062 (p = 1.43 Ã— 10 This study conducted the first GWAS for TS in a Taiwanese population, identifying a significant locus on chromosome 12q23.2 associated with DRAM1. These findings provide novel insights into the neurobiology of TS and potential directions for future research in this area.
