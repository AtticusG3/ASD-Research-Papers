## Abstract

# Evolutionary approach tries to explain several aspects of neurological diseases under the perspective of evolution. Evolutive bottle-neck may explain some aspects of neurodegenerative diseases. Additionally, a number of genetic alleles may reflect an evolutionary trade-off between benefits in early life and late-life disadvantages. Antagonistic pleiotropy theory suggests that some adaptive evolutionary changes increase individual fitness early in life, but can exacerbate detrimental aging-related processes We discuss three diseases with movement disorders from an evolutionary perspective: Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, and Tourette syndrome.

## Introduction

1.
The axonal arborization of dopaminergic neurons in the SNpc can be far more extensive than those of other neurotransmitter types (Matsuda et al. 2009; Diederich et al. 2019, 2020). Anatomical studies by Matsuda et al (Matsuda et al. 2009) showed that the axon of a single tyrosine hydroxylase-positive dopaminergic neuron occupies up to 6% of the volume of the striatum, which is remarkable.

2.
Dopaminergic neurons have broad action potentials and are autonomous pacemakers, exhibiting large oscillations in intracellular Ca2 + concentration driven by the opening of voltage-dependent Cav1 (L-type) Ca2 + channels (Surmeier et al. 2017; Diederich et al. 2020). Nigral dopamine neurons exhibit high basal levels of mitochondrial oxidant stress and free cytosolic Ca2+ (Bolam and Pissadaki 2012; Pissadaki and Bolam 2013; Diederich et al. 2020).

3.
Finally, due to massive arborization, human mesostriatal neurons occupy a much larger volume of the striatum than those of other vertebrates. Bolam and Pissadakis (Bolam and Pissadaki 2012; Pissadaki and Bolam 2013) highlighted the pronounced expansion of these neurons into the striatum compared with other mammals. Human nigral dopaminergic neurons must give rise to axons that are ten times the size and ten times the number of synapses in rats (Matsuda et al. 2009; Bolam and Pissadaki 2012; Pissadaki and Bolam 2013). According to the authors, this axonal architecture creates high energy demands on dopamine-producing nigral neurons to maintain cell function (Bolam and Pissadaki 2012; Pissadaki and Bolam 2013).
