## Abstract

While the implication of a dysfunctional dopaminergic system in Tourette syndrome (TS) is well established, the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms remain unclear. Apart from neurotransmitters, disturbed iron homeostasis and iron regulatory mechanisms are also suspected. Iron is a trace element of fundamental biological importance and is involved in the synthesis and metabolism of dopamine and its receptors and transporters. The goal of the current pre-registered, multi-modal, cross-sectional study was to investigate the relationship between potential iron homeostasis imbalances and dopaminergic system disturbances in patients with TS. Susceptibility-sensitive MRI at 7 Tesla was used to obtain surrogate measures for local brain iron in 25 patients with TS (age 30 ± 9 years, 6 female) and 40 matched control subjects. Additionally, dopamine D
