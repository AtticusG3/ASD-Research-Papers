•First broad scientometric analysis of over 50 years of research on ADHD.•We analyzed 28,381 publications with state-of-the art methods and visualization tools.•Research on ADHD has mainly used a medical model.•Further research should be conducted on psychosocial aspects (e.g., stigma).AbstractWe performed a scientometric analysis of the scientific literature on ADHD to evaluate key themes and trends over the past decades, informing future lines of research. We conducted a systematic search in Web of Science Core Collection up to 15 November, 2021 for scientific publications on ADHD. We retrieved 28,381 publications. We identified four major research trends: 1) ADHD treatment, risks factors and evidence synthesis; 2) neurophysiology, neuropsychology and neuroimaging; 3) genetics; 4) comorbidity. In chronological order, identified clusters of themes included: tricyclic antidepressants, ADHD diagnosis/treatment, bipolar disorder, EEG, polymorphisms, sleep, executive functions, pharmacology, genetics, environmental risk factors, emotional dysregulation, neuroimaging, non-pharmacological interventions, default mode network, Tourette, polygenic risk score, sluggish cognitive tempo, evidence-synthesis, toxins/chemicals, psychoneuroimmunology, Covid-19, and physical exercise. In conclusion, research on ADHD over the past decades has been driven mainly by a medical model. Whereas the neurobiological correlates of ADHD are undeniable and crucial, we look forward to further research on relevant psychosocial aspects related to ADHD, such as societal pressure, the concept of neurodiversity, and stigma.
