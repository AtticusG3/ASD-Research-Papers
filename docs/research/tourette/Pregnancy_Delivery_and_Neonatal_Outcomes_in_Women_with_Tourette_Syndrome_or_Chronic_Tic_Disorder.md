## Abstract

Adverse pregnancy and neonatal outcomes in women with Tourette syndrome or chronic tic disorder (TS/CTD) have not been systematically studied. This Swedish population-based study investigated associations between maternal TS/CTD and pregnancy, delivery, and neonatal outcomes. We included all singleton births at ≥22 weeks between 2001 and 2021. Each pregnancy with TS/CTD was matched on mother's age and delivery year with up to 10 pregnancies without TS/CTD. Crude and adjusted relative risks were estimated using Poisson log-linear regressions. We compared 581 pregnancies in women with TS/CTD to 5777 matched unexposed pregnancies. Maternal TS/CTD was associated with significantly increased risks of gestational diabetes, and elective and emergency cesarean section. Neonates of women with TS/CTD showed no increased risks of adverse neonatal outcomes. Maternal TS/CTD is associated with increased risk of some adverse pregnancy and delivery outcomes, but not with adverse neonatal outcomes. Enhanced maternal care for women with TS/CTD is warranted. © 2025 The Author(s).
