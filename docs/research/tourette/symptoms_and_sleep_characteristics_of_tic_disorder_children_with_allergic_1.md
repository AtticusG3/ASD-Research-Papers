## Abstract

Recent studies have shown a close relationship between tic disorder (TD) and allergic diseases in children. Allergic diseases also have a significant impact on children's sleep. Regrettably, it remains unclear whether TD children with comorbid allergic diseases exhibit distinct symptoms and sleep characteristics.
This study aimed to explore the symptoms and sleep characteristics of TD children with allergic diseases.
This was a case-control study involving 242 TD children (aged 3-14 years), of whom 168 had allergic diseases and 74 did not have allergic diseases. General information and allergy histories were recorded for all participants. The Yale Global Tic Severity Scale (YGTSS) was used to assess TD symptoms. All guardians of TD children were required to complete the Children's Sleep Habits Questionnaire (CSHQ).
Compared with the group of TD children without allergic diseases, the comorbid allergic disease group had significantly higher impairment scale scores and total tic scores on the YGTSS (all
This study found that TD children with allergic diseases exhibited more severe clinical symptoms and higher CSHQ total scores. The clinical and sleep changes are particularly significant in TD children with different types of allergic diseases, especially allergic rhinitis and allergic conjunctivitis.
