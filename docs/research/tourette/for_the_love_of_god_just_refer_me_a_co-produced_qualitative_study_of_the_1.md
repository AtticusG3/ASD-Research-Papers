## Abstract

Chronic tic disorders (CTDs)-such as Tourette Syndrome (TS)-are neurodevelopmental disorders affecting at least 1% of the population, causing repetitive involuntary movements and vocalisations known as tics. This study aimed to explore the lived experiences of accessing healthcare for people with CTD or TS and their families in the United Kingdom (UK), as part of a larger programme of work to inform change to healthcare services for this population.
Informed and designed with extensive patient and public involvement, the design utilised qualitative research using focus groups. Reflexive thematic analysis was used to analyse the data.
Participants were recruited via online support groups, social media and research registers.
