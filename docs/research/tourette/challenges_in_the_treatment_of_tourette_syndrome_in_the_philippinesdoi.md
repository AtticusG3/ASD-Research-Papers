## Abstract

Tourette Syndrome (TS), the most recognized primary tic disorder, affects about 0.9% of patients in movement disorders clinics in the Philippines. Its management faces significant challenges, including a shortage of movement disorder specialists. Limited access to care is further complicated by the lack of specialized behavioral therapy services and relatively high costs of pharmacological treatments. Many patients turn to online therapies, which may not be suitable for everyone. Additional difficulties arise from inadequate training for healthcare professionals and the absence of support groups, hindering effective management. This opinion paper highlights the critical need for increased funding, enhanced training programs, additional research, and the creation of support networks to improve the quality of care for TS patients in the Philippines.
