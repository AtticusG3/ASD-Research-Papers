## Abstract

This study evaluates the efficacy and safety of scalp acupuncture in treating tic disorders. We conducted a meta-analysis using data from 19 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) involving 1463 patients, sourced from various databases up to May 16, 2023. Stata15.0 was used to assess clinical efficacy rate, YGTSS score, TCM syndrome score, adverse reactions, and long-term efficacy. Scalp acupuncture significantly reduced YGTSS and TCM syndrome scores and improved clinical efficacy rates compared to controls [YGTSS: RR=-3.54, 95 % CI (-5.16, -1.93), P < 0.05; TCM: RR=-1.86, 95 % CI (-2.60, -1.13), P < 0.05; Efficacy: RR=1.14, 95 % CI (1.06, 1.23), P < 0.05]. Adverse reaction rates were lower in the treatment group (7.29 % vs. 12.61 % in controls), but not statistically significant [OR=0.69, 95 % CI (0.40, 1.18), P > 0.005]. Long-term efficacy was also stable [RR=-1.98, 95 % CI (-3.57, -0.39), P < 0.05]. Scalp acupuncture is effective in improving tic disorder symptoms, increasing treatment efficacy, and maintaining long-term benefits. However, due to the low quality of included RCTs and potential publication bias, further high-quality, large-sample, multicenter RCTs are needed for a more robust evaluation.
