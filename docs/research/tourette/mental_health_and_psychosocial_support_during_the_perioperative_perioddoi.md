## Abstract

Gender-affirming care (GAC) encompasses a comprehensive, patient-centered approach designed to support individuals in affirming their gender identity and expression. It includes a spectrum of medical, surgical, behavioral, social, psychological, and legal interventions tailored to the unique needs of each person. The mental and behavioral health needs of transgender and gender-diverse (TGD) individuals are highly individualized, requiring clinicians to provide care that is responsive to patients' mental and medical health needs. Before addressing perioperative psychosocial concerns, it is essential to understand the significant role mental health plays in the overall well-being of TGD individuals. Gender affirming providers with training in psychiatry, psychology, social work, and counseling are instrumental in supporting the mental health needs of TGD individuals. Perioperatively, this support can manifest in helping manage life stressors, treatment of underlying mental health disorders, conducting pre-surgical readiness assessment, and continued post-operative guidance.
