# A case of Gilles de la Tourette's syndrome with midbrain involvement.

## Abstract

In a 27-year-old patient with Gilles de la Tourette's syndrome a pineal tumor had been found 10 years previously and was apparently a coincidental finding. Minute calcifications were later detected around the third ventricle and the mesencephalic periaqueductal gray matter by high resolution computed tomography. It is argued that this observation may support Devinsky's speculations that midbrain involvement has pathological significance for the Gilles de la Tourette syndrome.
