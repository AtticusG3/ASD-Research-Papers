## Abstract

## Introduction
This is a large, population-based cross-sectional study with an observational design that prospectively enrolled 459 children with ADHD, using big data-derived brain charts as an objective standard for assessing brain development. Through normative brain chart modeling, we investigated regional brain development disparities between children with pure ADHD and those with comorbidities, exploring the associations between structural deviations and clinical symptoms.
Significant intergroup differences were observed in cortical thickness in the left cuneus gyrus (
Brain charts effectively unveil structural variations in ADHD and comorbid groups, aiding in the prediction of inattention severity. These insights advance our understanding of ADHD's neurobiology and pave the way for personalized diagnostics and therapies.
