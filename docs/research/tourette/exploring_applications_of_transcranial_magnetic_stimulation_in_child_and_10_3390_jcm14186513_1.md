This review aims to synthesize current evidence on the therapeutic potential of TMS in treating psychiatric conditions within this demographic.Methods: A comprehensive literature search was performed using PubMed and Google Scholar databases to identify studies published up to March 2025 that reported on the use of transcranial TMS in child and adolescent psychiatric disorders.Results: We found 32 published studies that included at least one type of TMS. TMS demonstrates potential as a safe and effective intervention for conditions such as depression, autism spectrum disorder, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, Tourette Syndrome, and childhood schizophrenia. However, the therapeutic outcomes vary significantly across conditions and protocols.Conclusions: TMS offers a promising, well-tolerated option for addressing psychiatric disorders in children and adolescents, but its application requires careful ethical and clinical consideration. To fully realize its potential, future research should focus on refining protocols, standardizing methodologies, and ensuring safety while expanding its use across diverse psychiatric conditions in younger populations.Keywords:adolescent psychiatric disorders; child psychiatric disorders; neuromodulation; transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS).---
