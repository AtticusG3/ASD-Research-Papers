## Abstract

Tourette syndrome (TS) is a chronic neurodevelopmental disorder with childhood onset characterized by multiple motor tics and at least one vocal tic, with symptoms persisting for over one year. Its exact etiology remains unclear. Identifying novel therapeutic targets for TS is critically important.
## Results
The expression of seven druggable genes was significantly associated with TS susceptibility (FDR < 0.05). TS susceptibility and three key genes (RET, CAPNS1, and LAMA5) were likely to share a causal variant. Further DNA methylation analysis identified seven critical methylation sites (cg02605258, cg02907768, cg06026331, cg09831553, cg12382846, cg19674797, and cg20752878), which indirectly influence TS development by regulating LAMA5 gene expression.
LAMA5 is the most promising potential drug target for mitigating TS risk. Our study not only reveals potential therapeutic targets but also provides directions for future TS drug development.
