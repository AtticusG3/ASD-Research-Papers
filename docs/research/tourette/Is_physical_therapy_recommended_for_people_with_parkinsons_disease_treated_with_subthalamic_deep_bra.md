## Abstract

Although deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus (STN-DBS) induces motor benefits in people with Parkinson's disease (PwPD), its effect on motor axial symptoms (e.g., postural instability, trunk posture alterations) and gait impairments (e.g., freezing of gait) is still ambiguous. Physical therapy (PT) effectively complements pharmacological treatment to improve postural stability, gait performance, and other dopamine-resistant symptoms (e.g. freezing of gait) in the general population with PD. Despite the positive potential of combined PT and STN-DBS surgery, scientific results are still lacking. We therefore involved worldwide leading experts on DBS and motor rehabilitation in PwPD in a consensus Delphi panel to define the current level of PT recommendation following STN-DBS surgery. After summarizing the few available findings through a systematic scoping review, we identified clinically and academically experienced DBS clinicians (n = 21) to discuss the challenges related to PT following STN-DBS. A 5-point Likert scale questionnaire was used and based on the results of the systematic review, thirty-nine questions were designed and submitted to the panel-half related to general considerations on PT following STN-DBS, and half related to PT treatments. Despite the low-to-moderate quality of data, the few available rehabilitation studies suggested that PT could improve dynamic and static balance, gait performance and posture in the population with PD receiving STN-DBS. Similarly, the panellists strongly agreed that PT might help improve motor symptoms and quality of life, and it may be prescribed to maximize the effects of stimulation. The experts agreed that physical therapists could be part of the multidisciplinary team taking care of the patients. Also, they agreed that conventional PT, but not massage or manual therapy, should be prescribed because of the specificity of STN-DBS implantation. Although RCT evidence is lacking, upon Delphi panel, PT for PwPD receiving STN-DBS can be potentially useful to maximize clinical improvement. However, more research is needed, with RCTs and well-designed studies. The rehabilitation and DBS community should expand this area of research to create guidelines for PT following STN-DBS.
