## Abstract

Caregivers of a person with aphasia (PWA) often lack knowledge about aphasia and have difficulty acting as effective conversation partners, feeling excluded and passive. Promoting the interlocutor's proficiency in the ability to support the PWA in a conversation is essential for improving patient-caregiver relationships.
This observational study aims to test a newly developed method, that is, TIC-TAC (which was derived from the Italian acronym 'Training di Istruzione alla Comunicazione Tra persona Afasica e Caregiver' (English transl. 'Communication Training Education for a Person with Aphasia and a Caregiver'), which was specifically designed to enhance the communicative competence of non-professional caregivers in their interaction with PWAs.
We enrolled 42 PWA-caregiver dyads. Three dyads dropped out from the study: Thus, the final sample included 39 dyads. The 'Caregiver Communication Assessment in Aphasia-Checklist' (ACCA-cl) evaluated the caregiver's communicative competence before and after the administration of the TIC-TAC method. This scale detects the verbal, para-verbal and non-verbal components of communication during the interaction with the patient.
Comparisons between pre- and post-method ACCA-cl scores showed a significant difference between T
The application of the TIC-TAC method to caregivers of PWAs yielded promising data regarding its impact on the evolution of caregivers' communicative competence across three representative levels of communication (verbal, para-verbal and non-verbal).
