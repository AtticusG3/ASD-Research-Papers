## Abstract

Spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) exhibit substantial clinical and genetic heterogeneity. SCAs primarily present with progressive ataxia as the cardinal clinical feature. However, they may co-occur with non-ataxic motor symptoms, including various movement disorders. Notably, certain SCA subtypes may present with movement disorders as their primary manifestation. This phenotypic complexity poses significant diagnostic challenges, particularly in distinguishing SCAs from other neurodegenerative conditions with overlapping presentations.
This study enrolled 35 probands initially diagnosed with movement disorders. Participants were stratified into hypokinetic movement disorders and hyperkinetic movement disorders groups. After excluding known genetic causes of movement disorders through targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) panel, negative cases received SCA repeat expansion testing. Genetically confirmed SCA cases received comprehensive clinical-genetic characterization.
Four SCA cases were identified in the hypokinetic movement disorders group (
