## Abstract

Complex mixed presentations of severe mental disorders (SMD) with treatment resistance pose major challenges in clinical practice. The role of novel neuronal antibodies in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is largely unexamined in this context.
A well-studied paradigmatic case of a 36-year-old female patient is reported.
She presented with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder-like symptoms (including frequent sensory overload), severe pain (pre-diagnosed as fibromyalgia and somatoform pain disorder), and motor tics. In addition, she developed secondary depressive symptoms. Various psychopharmacological treatment attempts were unsuccessful or not tolerated. The diagnostic routine work-up with a wide range of blood tests, electroencephalography (EEG), routine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analyses, and [
Novel antibodies against strategic brain structures, such as the thalamus, might be associated with some complex SMD. Further immunopsychiatric research in this direction holds promise for a better understanding of similar patients.
