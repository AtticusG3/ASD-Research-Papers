# Tourette's syndrome and neonatal anoxia: further evidence of an organic etiology.

## Abstract

Studies of Tourette's syndrome have indicated that the etiology may be either primary or secondary. Secondary Tourette's syndrome has been reported in association with numerous neurological conditions, but there have been no previous reports of Tourette's syndrome and its relationship to neonatal anoxia. This report presents the case of a 15-year-old boy with a history of Tourette's syndrome and neonatal anoxia and examines whether or not there is a connection between the two. To test the hypothesis that this is the first documented case of cerebral anoxia at birth followed by Tourette's, a review of the pertinent literature on secondary Tourette's syndrome is presented. Evidence of perinatal anoxia, subsequent Tourette's syndrome, a negative family history, as well as an examination of the statistical chances of anoxia and Tourette's syndrome co-existing and of all previous reports of acquired Tourette's syndrome tend to favor an organic perinatal insult as having caused the later development of Tourette's syndrome in the case of this adolescent.
