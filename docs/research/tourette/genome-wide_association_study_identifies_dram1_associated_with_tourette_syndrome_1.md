## Abstract

## Results
GWAS was performed on a Taiwanese TS/CTDs cohort with a sample size of 1007 patients with TS and 25,522 ancestry-matched controls. Additionally, polygenic risk score was calculated and assessed.
Genome-wide significant locus, rs12313062 (p = 1.43 × 10
This study conducted the first GWAS for TS in a Taiwanese population, identifying a significant locus on chromosome 12q23.2 associated with DRAM1. These findings provide novel insights into the neurobiology of TS and potential directions for future research in this area.
