## Abstract

Tourette syndrome (TS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by motor and vocal tics. Several susceptibility loci associated with TS have been identified previously in populations of European descent using genome-wide association studies (GWAS). However, the exact pathogenic mechanism underlying TS is unknown; additionally, the results of previous GWAS for TS were based on Western populations, which may not translate to other populations. Therefore, we conducted a GWAS in Taiwanese patients with TS and chronic tic disorders (CTDs), with an aim to elucidate the genetic basis and potential risk factors for TS in this population.
GWAS was performed on a Taiwanese TS/CTDs cohort with a sample size of 1007 patients with TS and 25,522 ancestry-matched controls. Additionally, polygenic risk score was calculated and assessed.
Genome-wide significant locus, rs12313062 (p = 1.43 × 10
This study conducted the first GWAS for TS in a Taiwanese population, identifying a significant locus on chromosome 12q23.2 associated with DRAM1. These findings provide novel insights into the neurobiology of TS and potential directions for future research in this area.

Several susceptibility loci associated with TS have been identified previously in populations of European descent using genome-wide association studies (GWAS). However, the exact pathogenic mechanism underlying TS is unknown; additionally, the results of previous GWAS for TS were based on Western populations, which may not translate to other populations. Therefore, we conducted a GWAS in Taiwanese patients with TS and chronic tic disorders (CTDs), with an aim to elucidate the genetic basis and potential risk factors for TS in this population.Methods:GWAS was performed on a Taiwanese TS/CTDs cohort with a sample size of 1007 patients with TS and 25,522 ancestry-matched controls. Additionally, polygenic risk score was calculated and assessed.Results:Genome-wide significant locus, rs12313062 (p = 1.43 × 10-8) and other 9 single nucleotide polymorphisms, were identified in chromosomes 12q23.2, associated with DRAM1 and was a novel susceptibility locus identified in TS/CTDs group. DRAM1, a lysosomal transmembrane protein regulated by p53, modulates autophagy and apoptosis, with potential implications for neuropsychiatric conditions associated with autophagy disruption.Conclusions:This study conducted the first GWAS for TS in a Taiwanese population, identifying a significant locus on chromosome 12q23.2 associated with DRAM1. These findings provide novel insights into the neurobiology of TS and potential directions for future research in this area.Keywords:Genetic Biobank of China Medical University Hospital; Genome-wide association study; Polygenic risk score; Taiwanese; Tourette syndrome.---
