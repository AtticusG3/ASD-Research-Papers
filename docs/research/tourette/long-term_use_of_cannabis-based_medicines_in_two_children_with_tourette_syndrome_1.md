## Abstract

Cannabis-based medicine (CBM) is recommended for the treatment of tics in otherwise treatment-resistant adult patients with Tourette syndrome (TS). However, evidence in children with TS is very limited. Long-term effects of CBM in this population are unknown.
## Results
We present two cases of minors with TS who started CBM treatment at the age of eight and 12 years, respectively, and continued treatment for five to six years resulting in clinically relevant symptom improvement without any severe adverse effects or negative impact on cognitive and academic performance.
