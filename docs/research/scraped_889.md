## Abstract

Abstract:
The electroretinogram (ERG) is a clinical test that records the retina's electrical response to light. The ERG is a promising way to study different neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders, including autism spectrum disorder (ASD) - a neurodevelopmental condition that impacts language, communication, and reciprocal social interactions. However, in heterogeneous populations, such as ASD, where the ability to collect large datasets is limited, the application of artificial intelligence (AI) is complicated. Synthetic ERG signals generated from real ERG recordings carry similar information as natural ERGs and, therefore, could be used as an extension for natural data to increase datasets so that AI applications can be fully utilized. As proof of principle, this study presents a Generative Adversarial Network capable of generating synthetic ERG signals of children with ASD and typically developing control individuals. We applied a Time Series Transformer and Visual Transformer with Continuous Wavelet Transform to enhance classification results on the extended synthetic signals dataset. This approach may support classification models in related psychiatric conditions where the ERG may help classify disorders.
