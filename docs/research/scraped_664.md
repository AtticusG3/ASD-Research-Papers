## Abstract

Chronic exposure to prenatal stress can impair neurogenesis and lead to irreversible cognitive and neuropsychiatric abnormalities in offspring. The retina is part of the nervous system; however, the impacts of prenatal stress on retinal neurogenesis and visual function remain unclear. This study examined how elevated prenatal glucocorticoid levels differentially affect retinal development in the offspring of pregnant mice exposed to chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS). Offspring were classified into control, stress-resilient, and stress-susceptible groups based on behavioral tests assessing spatial memory and depression-like behaviors. The stress-susceptible group exhibited significantly altered synaptogenesis, reduced ganglion cell development, decreased retinal thickness, and visiual impairment. These mice also showed a pervasive transformation of retinal astrocytes into a proinflammatory A1-like reactive state, evidenced by increased GFAP and decreased STAT3 expression levels. This astrocyte phenotype shift coincided with disruptions in neurogenesis and synaptic formation. Furthermore, prenatal exposure to exogenous corticosterone confirmed that the effects of prenatal stress are mediated by glucocorticoid-induced retinal neurodegeneration. Our findings suggest that elevated prenatal glucocorticoid levels trigger a series of neurodevelopmental disturbances leading to retinal neurodegeneration and vision impairment. This research highlights the impact of prenatal stress on retinal development and visual health, suggesting new avenues for understanding and potentially mitigating the negative effects of early-life stress on neurodevelopment.

## Introduction

Offspring from mothers exposed to stress during pregnancy often exhibit developmental abnormalities, including impaired neurogenesis in the fetal brain (Fatima et al. 2019; Weinstock 2005). Prenatal stress typically leads to irreversible cognitive and emotional abnormalities that persist throughout life (Fatima et al. 2019; Weinstock 2005; Zijlmans et al. 2015). The developing fetus is particularly vulnerable to maternal stress, because high concentrations of glucocorticoids secreted by the mother can cross the blood-placental barrier and inhibit the development and differentiation of neural stem cells (NSCs) (Provençal et al. 2020; Odaka et al. 2016; Choi et al. 2022). Postnatal stress can also impair neuronal function; however, these effects are usually reversible, unlike the enduring impact of prenatal stress, which may alter neural development and ongoing function through changes in epigenetic profiles (Moisiadis and Matthews 2014). In rodents, prenatal stress reduces neurotrophic factor signaling in the limbic system and inhibits synaptic formation, leading to hippocampal atrophy and persistent depression, anxiety, or memory loss in adulthood, even after the cessation of stress exposure (Choi et al. 2022).Behavioral studies on rodents and primates have discovered individual differences in susceptibility to stress-induced cognitive and emotional impairments. However, the mechanisms underlying this differential stress sensitivity remain poorly understood (Creutzberg et al. 2023; Tanelian et al. 2023; Taubman-Ben-Ari 2019). Some individuals exhibit a resilience phenotype, effectively overcoming stress and maintaining normal homeostasis, while others display a susceptible phenotype, resulting in neurodegeneration or behavioral dysfunction. Thus, many effects of prenatal stress on neurodevelopment and function may be missed by observing entire cohorts containing resilience and susceptible phenotypes. Therefore, comparing stress-resilient and stress-susceptible groups stratified by behavioral outcome is necessary to understand the differences in stress responses and neurodevelopmental sequelae.Mental stress in adults increases the risks of visual field impairment and vision loss, though the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood (Sabel et al. 2018, 2020; Keren et al. 2022). Clinical reports suggest that vision can improve upon stress removal or the administration of stress-alleviating drugs (Sabel et al. 2018, 2020; Keren et al. 2022). We hypothesized that changes in retinal cells under stress would be analogous to those observed in other central nervous system regions (Sabel et al. 2018; Keren et al. 2022; Marc and Stan 1990). An increase in intraocular pressure owing to mental stress is well-documented. For example, chronic social defeat stress induces vascular dysfunction in retinal arterioles, impairing vascular autoregulation in mice (Wang et al. 2021). However, the impact of prenatal stress on retinal neurogenesis and vision is not well known, possibly because of natural variations in susceptibility.Our earlier research revealed that prenatal glucocorticoid exposure reduces neurotrophic factor release from hippocampal astrocytes, impairing synaptic formation and neurogenesis. Similarly, elevated prenatal glucocorticoid levels hinder the differentiation of neural cells forming the retina during mouse eye development, resulting in aberrant synaptic formation. Therefore, this study aims to elucidate how prenatal stress disrupts retinal neural cell differentiation, resulting in visual impairment. Neurogenesis defects in the retina and subsequent vision dysfunction, accompanied by astrocyte activation, have been observed in offspring with phenotypes susceptible to prenatal stress.

## Materials and Methods

MaterialsAntibodies against Thy1 and β-actin were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Paso Robles, CA, USA). Antibodies against GFAP, STAT3, Tuj1, and aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 family member L1 (ALDH1L1) were acquired from Abcam (Cambridge, MA, USA). Antibodies against doublecortin (DCX), NeuN, vGLUT, and PSD95 were purchased from Thermo Fisher (Rockford, IL, USA).Animal Study DesignAll animal housing and experimental protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Jeju National University (#2023–0031), and experiments were designed in compliance with the ARRIVE guidelines. Pregnant ICR mice aged 8 weeks were housed under controlled conditions (22 °C, 70% relative humidity, 12 h: 12 h light: dark cycle, and ad libitum access to food and drinking solution).To evaluate how maternal stress influences the development of retina ganglion cells in offspring, dams were exposed to CUMS protocol starting on day 8 of pregnancy, and the protocol continued twice daily for approximately 2 weeks until labor. The stressors used in this study were as follows: 1 h of swimming, confinement, cage tilt, food/water deprivation, changes in light/dark cycle, reduction of cage size, and soiled cage. The differentiation state of retinal ganglion cells was evaluated in the offspring on postnatal day 21 (P21) and postnatal week 10. Results were compared to the age-matched offspring of control female dams housed without CUMS exposure. Offspring of CUMS-treated dams were categorized into susceptible or resilient groups based on the results of the Y-maze alternation test and tail suspension test (TST). Mice that could not be clearly classified (showing only one behavior change) were excluded from further study. Offspring of control dam also underwent the behavioral tests.Female pregnant ICR mice exposed to exogenous corticosterone mimic the maternal stress mouse model because corticosterone is the primary stress-response hormone. Corticosterone (10 mg/kg) was dissolved in a solution containing 50% propylene glycol in PBS and injected intraperitoneally on embryonic day 15 (E15). Control dams received equal-volume vehicle (50% propylene glycol in PBS). Mice from corticosterone-injected and vehicle-injected dams were tested for spatial memory deficits and depressive phenotype on P21.Y-Maze Spontaneous Alternation TestThe Y-maze spontaneous alternation test exploits on the innate tendency of rodents to explore new safe environments rather than previously explored safe environments (Kraeuter et al. 2019). Thus, the number of new arm entries over old arm entries (repeated exploration) of the Y-maze reflects spatial working memory. Before testing, mice were habituated to the testing room for 3 h to minimize stress. And individual mouse was then allowed to freely explore the Y-maze for 10 min while the number of arm entries and triads were recorded to calculate the percentage alternation. An entry was counted when all four limbs were within the arm. The alternation value represents the number of alternations divided by the number of total triads.TSTThe TST is used to evaluate the depressive-like state of rodents (Steru et al. 1985). Before the test, mice were habituated to the testing room for 3 h to minimize stress. Mice were both acoustically and visually isolated and then suspended 50 cm above the floor for 6 min using adhesive tape placed ~ 1 cm from the tip of the tail. However, only the last 4 min of the test was analyzed because most mice vigorously try to escape the environment at the beginning of the test. The total duration of immobility induced by tail suspension was measured according to the method of Steru et al., with longer immobility indicative of a stronger depressive phenotype (Steru et al. 1985).Visual Cliff TestGross visual acuity was evaluated using the visual cliff test, following previously described protocol with minor modifications (Kisugi et al. 2014). A clear glass plate (60 × 60 cm) was set 1 m above the ground. And a yellow board (15 × 15 cm total dimensions) was placed at the center. Thus, the edge of the board represents a virtual “cliff.” Each mouse was placed in the center of the board, and the time spent on the board without leaving was recorded. A shorter time at the center is indicative of poorer visual acuity.Blood Sampling and Corticosterone AnalysisBlood was acquired from the abdominal aorta of mice which underwent all the behavior tests just before sacrifice. Plasma was then separated from whole blood by centrifugation and corticosterone concentration was measured using a competitive ELISA kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Thermo Fisher). Briefly, the optical density at 450 nm was measured using a microplate reader.Histopathology and Immunohistochemistry (IHC)Mice were subjected to deep anesthesia with zoletil (50 mg/kg) and perfused transcardially with calcium-free Tyrode’s solution, followed by 4% paraformaldehyde. For histopathology, eyeballs were extracted, post-fixed for 2 h in 4% paraformaldehyde, and embedded in paraffin. Serial sections (10 μm) including the retina were cut using a manual rotary microtome (Leica, Nussloch, Germany), mounted on slides, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Stained sections were photographed under light microscopy and retinal thickness was measured using ImageJ (developed by Wayne Rasband, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA). For IHC, eye tissues including the retina were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min, permeabilized with 0.1% triton X for 10 min, and preblocked with 5% normal goat serum in PBS at room temperature for 1 h. Sections were then incubated with the primary antibody overnight at 4 °C, followed by incubation in an appropriate secondary antibody for 2 h at room temperature. All immunostained sections were imaged using a confocal microscope (Olympus FV1200, Olympus, Southborough, MA, USA, in Bio-Health Materials Core-Facility, Jeju National University or Leica Stellaris 5). Fluorescence intensity analysis was performed using Fiji software. Signal overlap (co-staining) was evaluated by calculating Pearson’s correlation coefficient.Western BlottingFor estimation of protein expression changes, samples were lysed in EzRIPA buffer (ATTO, Tokyo, Japan) containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors (Thermo Fisher) using a homogenizer. Then, cell debris was cleared by centrifugation (13,000× g at 4 °C, 30 min). The total protein concentration in the supernatant was then measured using a bicinchoninic acid quantification assay (Thermo Fisher), detected by SPECTRAMAX ID5 (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA, USA, in Bio-Health Materials Core-Facility, Jeju National University). Equal protein (20 μg) per gel lane was separated on 8–12% SDS-PAGE gels and transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride membranes. The membranes were blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin in tris–buffered saline containing 0.2% Tween-20 [TBST; 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris–HCl (pH 7.6), 0.1% Tween-20] solution for 30 min, washed three times in TBST, and probed with the indicated primary antibodies in 4 °C overnight. Membranes were then washed three times again in TBST, and incubated in HRP-conjugated mouse or rabbit secondary antibodies (Thermo Fisher) at room temperature for 2 h. Immunostaining was detected by ChemiDoc MP (BioRad, Hercules, CA, USA, in Bio-Health Materials Core-Facility, Jeju National University) and quantified by densitometry using ImageJ.Scanning Electron MicroscopyEye tissues were fixed in 0.2 M PBS containing 2.5% glutaraldehyde at 4 °C overnight, washed in 0.2 M phosphate buffer, post-fixed in 1% osmium tetroxide (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) at 4 °C for 2 h, rinsed in distilled water, and dehydrated in a gradient ethanol series. After dehydration, synapse formation in the retina was examined using field emission-scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, JSM-7610F plus, JEOL, Tokyo, Japan).Statistical AnalysisAll imaging experiments and animal tests were conducted and assessed by experiments blinded to treatment group. Sample sizes were kept similar between experimental groups and replicates of experiments. The sample size ‘N’ represents the number of biologically independent replicates, and statistical analyses were conducted using these independent values. The Shapiro–Wilk test was used to determine the normality of all datasets. Based on the results, datasets were then analyzed using nonparametric statistics. Two groups were compared by the Mann–Whitney U-test and more than two groups were analyzed by using the Kruskal–Wallis test. Pearson’s correlation coefficients were measured to analyze the colocalization to confirm whether the overlap was statistically significant. All results were expressed as a mean value ± standard error of the mean (S.E.M.) and analyzed using SPSS for Windows (version 26; IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA) and GraphPad Prism 10 software (Graphpad, CA, USA). A p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant for all tests.

## Results

Identification of Resilient and Susceptible Mice Exposed to Prenatal StressOffspring Classification and Behavioral Assessments Following Maternal CUMSWe aimed to assess the effect of prenatal stress on neurogenesis in the offspring retina. Individuals react to stress differently; some develop maladaptive behaviors, whereas others sucessfully overcome adversity. We classified the CUMS-exposed offspring (N = 18) into stress-resilient, stress-susceptible, or undefined categories based on their Y-maze performance and TST (Fig. 1A). Offspring exhibiting a lower spontaneous alternation rate (%) in the Y-maze test and lower mobility in the TST compared with control offspring from untreated dams were classified as susceptible (N = 5). Offspring demonstrating Y-maze and TST behaviors similar to those of the control offspring were classified as resilient (N = 5). Mice with unclear stress-response phenotypes were excluded from the study.Fig. 1Study design and classification of mice exposed to prenatal CUMS into resilient and susceptible groups. A 8 weeks-old pregnant mice were subjected to CUMS twice daily for 2 weeks, starting on eighth day of pregnancy. The Y-maze alternation test and TST were performed on the offspring at P21 to classify them into prenatal stress-resilient and susceptible groups. These mice were then examined for changes in retinal ganglion cell differentiation. B-C Results of the Y-maze alternation test to determine spatial working memory. B The graph displays the percentage of spontaneous alternation in the control group (N = 8) and the CUMS-exposed group (N = 18). C Mice in the susceptible group exhibited deficits in spatial memory (N = 5 per group). D-E Results of the TST to assess the depression-like phenotype. D The graph illustrates the percentage of mobility and immobility times in the control (N = 8) and the CUMS (N = 18) groups. E Mice in the susceptible group demonstrated enhanced depressive-like symptoms (N = 5 per group). Mann–Whitney U test was conducted. *,**, *** indicates p < 0.05, p < 0.01, p < 0.001  versus control group, respectively. ## indicates p < 0.01 versus resilient group. Quantitative data are presented as mean ± S.E.MFull size imageY-Maze Test ResultsThe Y-maze test leverages the natural inclination of rodents to explore new environments; repeated arm exploration indicates poor spatial working memory (Kraeuter et al. 2019). The mean spontaneous alternation was 63.3% ± 1.585% for the control group (N = 8) and 53.24% ± 3.086% for the total CUMS group (N = 18) (Fig. 1B, p = 0.024). When the CUMS group was further divided into resilient and susceptible categories, spontaneous alternation values were 61.40% ± 2.561% and 41.40% ± 3.311% for the resilient and susceptible groups, respectively (p = 0.008), indicating successful segregation into two distinct stress-responsive groups. Furthermore, the difference between the control and susceptible groups was significant (p = 0.0003) (Fig. 1C). Thus, compared with resilient and control groups, the susceptible group demonstrated impaired spatial working memory.TST ResultsImmobility in the TST is considered a depressive-like behavioral phenotype during inescapable stress (Steru et al. 1985). No significant differences were observed in mobility or immobility time between the control offspring and those exposed to prenatal stress (Fig. 1D). However, compared with the control and resilient groups, the susceptible group exhibited reduced mobility and a significant increase in immobility time (Fig. 1E). Thus, the susceptible group demonstrated a more severe depression-like phenotype than the resilient group.Serum Corticosterone LevelsNext, we measured the concentration of corticosterone in the plasma. Chronic stress impairs negative feedback control within the hypothalamus–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis, increasing serum glucocorticoid levels (Choi et al. 2017; Gądek-Michalska et al. 2013). The susceptible group had markedly higher corticosterone levels than the control and resilient groups, suggesting that resilience depends on maintaining optimal HPA axis function (Supplementary Fig. 1).Effects of Prenatal Stress on Retinal Development and FunctionEffects on Retinal ThicknessRetinal thickness was compared among the control, resilient, and susceptible offspring groups at P21 using ex vivo hematoxylin and eosin staining. A significant decrease in retinal thickness and nuclear degeneration was observed in the susceptible group (average: 183.9 μm) compared with both control (average: 216.6 μm) and resilient (average: 222 μm) groups. This result suggests that prenatal stress, along with concomitant high glucocorticoid exposure, impairs neurogenesis and neuronal differentiation in the retina (Fig. 2A).Fig. 2Prenatal CUMS exposure reduces retinal thickness and induces vision impairment in susceptible mice. A Eye tissue samples containing retina were stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Retinal thickness and counting the nuclei were measured by image J. Retina was significantly thinner in the susceptible group than in the control and resilient groups. The number of nuclei in outer nuclear layer (ONL) of retina was decreased in the susceptible group. Scale bars, 100 μm (magnification, × 400). N = 5 per group. B-C Visual cliff test results (N = 5). B At P21, there was no difference among the groups in time spent on the periphery. C At 10 week, the susceptible group spent more time on the periphery. Mann–Whitney U test was conducted. **,*** indicates p < 0.01 and p < 0.001 versus control group, respectively. ##,### indicates p < 0.01 and p < 0.001 versus resilient group. Quantitative data are presented as mean ± S.E.MFull size imageEffects on VisionTo assess the impact of prenatal stress on visual function, we compared offspring behavior using the visual cliff test. No significant difference was observed in the time spent in the periphery between the control and resilient groups compared with the susceptible group on P21 (Fig. 2B). However, 10 weeks after birth, the susceptible group spent more time on the periphery than the control and resilient groups, suggesting a gradual development of visual impairment (Fig. 2C).Effects of Prenatal Stress on Neurogenesis and SynaptogenesisPreviously, we demonstrated that prenatal glucocorticoid exposure impairs synaptogenesis and neurogenesis in the hippocampus (Choi et al. 2022). We hypothesized that prenatal stress would similarly induce neurodevelopmental deficits in the retina. To test this, we conducted immunostaining for the immature neuronal marker DCX and the mature neuronal marker NeuN in retinal sections and calculated the DCX/NeuN ratio. This ratio was elevated in the susceptible group among stress-exposed mice, indicating that neurogenesis was suppressed (Fig. 3A). To assess whether prenatal stress affects the ganglion cell population, we conducted immunostaining for Thy1, a specific marker of the axonal processes of ganglion cells in the retina and optic nerves (Perry et al. 1984). The staining intensity of Thy1–positive cells was lower in the susceptible group than that in the resilient group, implying a reduction in ganglion cell number and incomplete optic nerve development (Fig. 3B). Our previous study observed that prenatal glucocorticoid exposure specifically reduced glutamatergic synaptogenesis without affecting GABAergic synaptogenesis in the hippocampus (Choi et al. 2022). To assess whether prenatal stress has similar effects on the retina, we stained eye tissue with vGLUT1, a presynaptic marker for glutamatergic synapses, and PSD95, a postsynaptic marker. Co-staining for vGLUT1 and PSD95 was markedly reduced in the susceptible group compared with the control and resilient groups, indicating a reduction in glutamatergic synaptogenesis (Fig. 3C). Furthermore, scanning electron microscopy revealed a reduced spine intersection ratio in retinal sections from susceptible mice compared with the control and resilient mice (Fig. 3D). These results indicate that neurogenesis and synaptogenesis were impaired in the retinas of mice susceptible to prenatal stress.Fig. 3Prenatal CUMS impairs retinal neurogenesis and synaptogenesis in susceptible mice.

We speculated that prenatal stress similarly affects the transformation of astrocytes in the retina. Immunohistochemical staining of retinal sections for the reactive astrocyte marker GFAP revealed a greater density of GFAP-positive cells in the susceptible group than in the control and resilient groups, indicating an increase in the pan-reactive astrocyte population owing to prenatal stress (Fig. 4A). Furthermore, Western blotting confirmed increased GFAP expression. However, the astrocyte-specific marker ALDH1L1 is not changed in the susceptible group (Fig. 4B). This result indicated no change in the number of astrocytes; rather, more astrocytes from the same pool were activated (transformed) because of prenatal CUMS in the susceptible group. Furthermore, the expression levels of STAT3, a stress-associated signaling factor enriched in protective A2-like astrocytes, were lower in the susceptible group. The enhanced expression of DCX and the reduced expression levels of Thy1 and Tuj1 were exhibited, indicating that impaired neurogenesis occurred in the retina of susceptible group. The transformation of astrocytes into A1-like astrocytes may contribute to a decline in retinal neurogenesis, possibly due to the reduced secretion of neurotrophic factors.Fig. 4Prenatal CUMS induces the reactive transformation of retinal astrocytes concomitant with reduced neurogenesis in susceptible mice.

In the prenatal corticosterone injection group, IHC results revealed a significant decrease in the NeuN/DCX ratio, Thy1 expression, and glutamatergic synaptogenesis in the retina (Supplementary Fig. 2). Additionally, Western blotting revealed reduced STAT3 expression and higher GFAP expression in the retinas of the prenatal corticosterone injection group compared with vehicle-treated controls (Fig. 4C). Thus, the increased transformation of astrocytes into A1-like reactive astrocytes, decrease in A2-like astrocytes, reduced neurogenesis, and suppressed glutamatergic synaptogenesis observed in susceptible offspring following prenatal CUMS exposure were recapitulated by administering corticosterone. This result indicates that the higher peak glucocorticoid concentrations observed in these mice contributed to deficits in retinal structure and function.

## Offspring Classification and Behavioral Assessments Following Maternal CUMS

We aimed to assess the effect of prenatal stress on neurogenesis in the offspring retina. Individuals react to stress differently; some develop maladaptive behaviors, whereas others sucessfully overcome adversity. We classified the CUMS-exposed offspring (N = 18) into stress-resilient, stress-susceptible, or undefined categories based on their Y-maze performance and TST (Fig. 1A). Offspring exhibiting a lower spontaneous alternation rate (%) in the Y-maze test and lower mobility in the TST compared with control offspring from untreated dams were classified as susceptible (N = 5). Offspring demonstrating Y-maze and TST behaviors similar to those of the control offspring were classified as resilient (N = 5). Mice with unclear stress-response phenotypes were excluded from the study.
Fig. 1Study design and classification of mice exposed to prenatal CUMS into resilient and susceptible groups. A 8 weeks-old pregnant mice were subjected to CUMS twice daily for 2 weeks, starting on eighth day of pregnancy. The Y-maze alternation test and TST were performed on the offspring at P21 to classify them into prenatal stress-resilient and susceptible groups. These mice were then examined for changes in retinal ganglion cell differentiation. B-C Results of the Y-maze alternation test to determine spatial working memory.

## Y-Maze Test Results

The Y-maze test leverages the natural inclination of rodents to explore new environments; repeated arm exploration indicates poor spatial working memory (Kraeuter et al. 2019). The mean spontaneous alternation was 63.3% ± 1.585% for the control group (N = 8) and 53.24% ± 3.086% for the total CUMS group (N = 18) (Fig. 1B, p = 0.024). When the CUMS group was further divided into resilient and susceptible categories, spontaneous alternation values were 61.40% ± 2.561% and 41.40% ± 3.311% for the resilient and susceptible groups, respectively (p = 0.008), indicating successful segregation into two distinct stress-responsive groups. Furthermore, the difference between the control and susceptible groups was significant (p = 0.0003) (Fig. 1C). Thus, compared with resilient and control groups, the susceptible group demonstrated impaired spatial working memory.

## TST Results

Immobility in the TST is considered a depressive-like behavioral phenotype during inescapable stress (Steru et al. 1985). No significant differences were observed in mobility or immobility time between the control offspring and those exposed to prenatal stress (Fig. 1D). However, compared with the control and resilient groups, the susceptible group exhibited reduced mobility and a significant increase in immobility time (Fig. 1E). Thus, the susceptible group demonstrated a more severe depression-like phenotype than the resilient group.

## Serum Corticosterone Levels

Next, we measured the concentration of corticosterone in the plasma. Chronic stress impairs negative feedback control within the hypothalamus–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis, increasing serum glucocorticoid levels (Choi et al. 2017; Gądek-Michalska et al. 2013). The susceptible group had markedly higher corticosterone levels than the control and resilient groups, suggesting that resilience depends on maintaining optimal HPA axis function (Supplementary Fig. 1).

## Effects on Retinal Thickness

Retinal thickness was compared among the control, resilient, and susceptible offspring groups at P21 using ex vivo hematoxylin and eosin staining. A significant decrease in retinal thickness and nuclear degeneration was observed in the susceptible group (average: 183.9 μm) compared with both control (average: 216.6 μm) and resilient (average: 222 μm) groups. This result suggests that prenatal stress, along with concomitant high glucocorticoid exposure, impairs neurogenesis and neuronal differentiation in the retina (Fig. 2A).

Retinal thickness and counting the nuclei were measured by image J. Retina was significantly thinner in the susceptible group than in the control and resilient groups. The number of nuclei in outer nuclear layer (ONL) of retina was decreased in the susceptible group. Scale bars, 100 μm (magnification, × 400). N = 5 per group. B-C Visual cliff test results (N = 5).

## Effects on Vision

To assess the impact of prenatal stress on visual function, we compared offspring behavior using the visual cliff test. No significant difference was observed in the time spent in the periphery between the control and resilient groups compared with the susceptible group on P21 (Fig. 2B). However, 10 weeks after birth, the susceptible group spent more time on the periphery than the control and resilient groups, suggesting a gradual development of visual impairment (Fig. 2C).

## Effects of Prenatal Stress on Neurogenesis and Synaptogenesis

Previously, we demonstrated that prenatal glucocorticoid exposure impairs synaptogenesis and neurogenesis in the hippocampus (Choi et al. 2022). We hypothesized that prenatal stress would similarly induce neurodevelopmental deficits in the retina. To test this, we conducted immunostaining for the immature neuronal marker DCX and the mature neuronal marker NeuN in retinal sections and calculated the DCX/NeuN ratio. This ratio was elevated in the susceptible group among stress-exposed mice, indicating that neurogenesis was suppressed (Fig. 3A). To assess whether prenatal stress affects the ganglion cell population, we conducted immunostaining for Thy1, a specific marker of the axonal processes of ganglion cells in the retina and optic nerves (Perry et al. 1984). The staining intensity of Thy1–positive cells was lower in the susceptible group than that in the resilient group, implying a reduction in ganglion cell number and incomplete optic nerve development (Fig. 3B). Our previous study observed that prenatal glucocorticoid exposure specifically reduced glutamatergic synaptogenesis without affecting GABAergic synaptogenesis in the hippocampus (Choi et al. 2022). To assess whether prenatal stress has similar effects on the retina, we stained eye tissue with vGLUT1, a presynaptic marker for glutamatergic synapses, and PSD95, a postsynaptic marker. Co-staining for vGLUT1 and PSD95 was markedly reduced in the susceptible group compared with the control and resilient groups, indicating a reduction in glutamatergic synaptogenesis (Fig. 3C). Furthermore, scanning electron microscopy revealed a reduced spine intersection ratio in retinal sections from susceptible mice compared with the control and resilient mice (Fig. 3D). These results indicate that neurogenesis and synaptogenesis were impaired in the retinas of mice susceptible to prenatal stress.

## Effect of Prenatal Stress on Astrocyte Reactivity

Our previous study proposed that glucocorticoid-induced suppression of NSCs’ neurogenic potential is linked to the transformation of astrocytes into A1-like neurotoxic reactive astrocytes (Choi et al. 2022). We speculated that prenatal stress similarly affects the transformation of astrocytes in the retina. Immunohistochemical staining of retinal sections for the reactive astrocyte marker GFAP revealed a greater density of GFAP-positive cells in the susceptible group than in the control and resilient groups, indicating an increase in the pan-reactive astrocyte population owing to prenatal stress (Fig. 4A). Furthermore, Western blotting confirmed increased GFAP expression. However, the astrocyte-specific marker ALDH1L1 is not changed in the susceptible group (Fig. 4B). This result indicated no change in the number of astrocytes; rather, more astrocytes from the same pool were activated (transformed) because of prenatal CUMS in the susceptible group. Furthermore, the expression levels of STAT3, a stress-associated signaling factor enriched in protective A2-like astrocytes, were lower in the susceptible group. The enhanced expression of DCX and the reduced expression levels of Thy1 and Tuj1 were exhibited, indicating that impaired neurogenesis occurred in the retina of susceptible group. The transformation of astrocytes into A1-like astrocytes may contribute to a decline in retinal neurogenesis, possibly due to the reduced secretion of neurotrophic factors.

## Changes in Retinal Neurogenesis and A1-Like Astrocyte Number Following Exogenous Corticosterone Administration

To provide supporting evidence that elevated glucocorticoid levels cause these deficits in retinal neurogenesis and vision among susceptible mice, we injected a subgroup of dams with corticosterone or vehicle on E15 and examined the offspring retinas at P21. In the prenatal corticosterone injection group, IHC results revealed a significant decrease in the NeuN/DCX ratio, Thy1 expression, and glutamatergic synaptogenesis in the retina (Supplementary Fig. 2). Additionally, Western blotting revealed reduced STAT3 expression and higher GFAP expression in the retinas of the prenatal corticosterone injection group compared with vehicle-treated controls (Fig. 4C). Thus, the increased transformation of astrocytes into A1-like reactive astrocytes, decrease in A2-like astrocytes, reduced neurogenesis, and suppressed glutamatergic synaptogenesis observed in susceptible offspring following prenatal CUMS exposure were recapitulated by administering corticosterone. This result indicates that the higher peak glucocorticoid concentrations observed in these mice contributed to deficits in retinal structure and function.

## Discussion

We demonstrated that prenatal stress disrupts retinal development, resulting in gradual visual impairment in adulthood. Prenatal stress resulted in reduced retinal neurogenesis, impaired glutamatergic synaptogenesis, and reactive transformation of retinal astrocytes. Unlike previous studies on prenatal stress in rodents, our study classified offspring into resilient and susceptible groups based on behavior. This approach avoids the issue of averaging results across an entire cohort, which may obscure differences between stress-susceptible and control groups. Compared with resilient mice with the same prenatal stress exposure history, susceptible mice exhibited spatial memory impairment, depressive-like behaviors, elevated plasma corticosterone levels, and progressive visual deficits. The impairments in neurogenesis and synaptogenesis observed in stress-susceptible mice are attributable to greater glucocorticoid exposure and the deleterious effects of A1-like astrocyte transformation.The offspring of dams subjected to CUMS during pregnancy exhibited several deficits, with more than half segregating into clear resilient and susceptible subgroups, consistent with the findings of studies involving adult animals exposed to prenatal CUMS or current chronic stress (Creutzberg et al. 2023; Tanelian et al. 2023; Taubman-Ben-Ari. 2019). However, the underlying mechanisms for stress resiliency and susceptibility remain incompletely understood. Neural circuits and systems influencing stress resiliency and vulnerability include various neuroendocrine pathways, circuits in the hippocampus and medial prefrontal cortex, reward pathways, and serotonergic pathways from the dorsal raphe nucleus to the hypothalamus and limbic system (Franklin Tamara et al. 2012). Sex hormones may also influence the stress response. For example, adult male Sprague–Dawley rats subjected to prenatal stress showed greater anxiety-related and depression-related behaviors than females along with higher basal plasma corticosterone levels (Hove et al. 2013). Sex differences were observed in the expression levels of genes associated with glutamatergic and GABAergic neurotransmission, mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling, neurotrophic factor signaling, phosphodiesterase/cyclic nucleotide signaling, and insulin signaling within the hippocampus and frontal cortex. Moreover, epigenetic regulation differs between sexes potentially contributing to the gene-environment interactions that confer individual differences in stress responses (Franklin Tamara et al. 2012; Hove et al. 2013). For instance, susceptibility to chronic stress is associated with histone 3 acetylation and methylation in a set of genes expressed in the nucleus accumbens (Wilkinson et al. 2009). Reduced expression of histone methyltransferase G9a in the nucleus accumbens, acetylation of the glia cell-derived neurotrophic factor promoter, greater histone 3 lysine 27 trimethylation, and the activity of KAP1, a regulator of histone acetylation and methylation, may also contribute to stress susceptibility and resilience (Uchida et al. 2011; Jakobsson et al. 2008). In the current study, offspring born to dams subjected to CUMS exhibited substantial variation in susceptibility to various sequelae despite a similar postnatal environment, supporting the predominance of individual variations in gene expression and epigenetic profiles.These genetic differences in expression profiles between resilient and susceptible groups may arise from irreversible changes in glucocorticoid signaling. The greater plasma corticosterone levels in the susceptible group further support a link between prenatal stress and HPA axis dysregulation in susceptible offspring. This dysregulation may indirectly contribute to the observed vision impairments, as chronic stress disrupts the negative feedback loop in the HPA axis, leading to sustained glucocorticoid elevation and neuronal damage. Normally, the negative feedback loop limits long-term exposure of tissues to the catabolic and immunosuppressive actions of glucocorticoids (Guilliams and Edwards 2010). However, chronic and repeated stressors can lead to HPA axis dysregulation, resulting in inappropriately elevated glucocorticoid secretion, glucocorticoid receptor (GR) resistance, and a chronically hyperactivated HPA axis (Guilliams and Edwards 2010; Cohen et al. 2012). Moreover, chronic stress markedly reduces circulating levels of the endogenous GR antagonist dehydroepiandrosterone, further increasing glucocorticoid levels (Guilliams and Edwards 2010). Stress resilient genes, however, are characterized by their ability to modulate GR resistance and HPA axis hyperactivity, improving cognitive and emotional resilience.Studies have investigated the impact of high cortisol levels due to maternal stress during pregnancy on human fetal development (Fatima et al. 2019; Weinstock 2005). In pregnant women, cortisol levels increase approximately two to four times compared with nonpregnant women. However, the 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 (HSD11B2) present in the placenta converts cortisol into a biologically inactive form, preventing it from influencing the fetal environment (Mastorakos and Ilias 2003; Sandman et al. 2006). Acute and chronic maternal stress downregulate HSD11B2 in the placenta, allowing cortisol to accumulate within the fetal environment (Jahnke et al. 2021). Additionally, increased secretion of placental corticotrophin-releasing hormone in response to maternal cortisol can alter fetal HPA axis function (Huizink et al. 2004). We examined these effects in offspring following maternal corticosterone injection to support the involvement of excessive glucocorticoid signaling in retinal neurodegeneration and vision loss. Administering prenatal glucocorticoids without maternal stress disrupts brain development, as evidenced by reduced brain weight and structural abnormalities in critical brain regions (Weinstock 2001; Cartier et al. 2016). Similar to the susceptible group, these mice exhibited reduced retinal neurogenesis. Similar mechanisms are possibly involved in the prenatal stress- and glucocorticoid-induced retinal neurogenesis impairments, observed in this study. In contrast, resilient mice, even those born of the same dam, exhibited no significant difference in plasma corticosterone levels compared with naive control offspring and no deficits in retinal development, and visual function. Consequently, changes in the HPA axis induced by chronic stress likely contributed to the observed impairments in retinal neurogenesis and synaptogenesis. This finding further suggests that normalizing HPA axis activity is an effective strategy for mitigating the deleterious effects of prenatal stress on neurogenesis in the retina.A decrease in retinal thickness was observed in the susceptible group, and electron microscopy revealed reduced retinal ganglion cell spine intersections. Retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thinning is an early neurodegenerative change in the retina, indicative of reduced ganglion axon number (Cheung et al. 2017). RNFL thickness is a sensitive indicator of neurodevelopment and neurodegeneration in other contexts (Rothman et al. 2015; Heide et al. 2021). Recent studies have suggested that retinal thickness can be a biomarker for condition like multiple sclerosis, dementia, and cognitive impairment (Esmael et al. 2020; Mutlu et al. 2018; Haan et al. 2017). Decreased retinal thickness due to a prenatal stress-induced reduction in neurogenesis also suggests that prenatal stress may contribute to other conditions associated with nerve atrophy, such as multiple sclerosis.Prenatal stress also transformed retinal astrocytes into A1-like reactive astrocytes and reduced protective A2-like astrocytes, evidenced by an elevated GFAP to ALDH1L1 ratio and decreased STAT3. Astrocytes maintain the extracellular microenvironment, regulate neuroimmunity, and support neuronal metabolism (Fan and Huo 2021). In response to central nervous system damage, astrocytes are transformed into proinflammatory/neurotoxic A1 or anti-inflammatory/neuroprotective A2 phenotypes (Fan and Huo 2021). Activated A1-like astrocytes kill neurons and mature oligodendrocytes and inhibit neuronal activity by releasing exosomes such as C3, proinflammatory factors such as nitric oxide and TNF-α, or the glutamatergic receptor co-agonist D-serine (Liddelow et al. 2017; Luna-Herrera et al. 2020; Balu et al. 2019). Heightened neuroinflammation, an increased number of A1-like reactive astrocytes, and severe neuronal loss were observed in the hippocampus of IL-10tm1/tm1 mice. These neurocellular abnormalities were accompanied by memory impairments and depression-like behavior (Zhang et al. 2020). Byun et al. reported that corticosterone induced excessive excitatory synapse elimination in mice subjected to early social deprivation by activating GR-MERTK pathway to increase astrocytic phagocytosis (Byun et al. 2023). Our previous study discovered that NSC-derived astrocytes were transformed into A1-like neurotoxic astrocytes following glucocorticoid treatment (Choi et al. 2022). We also observed reduced neurogenesis in the mouse hippocampus associated with glucocorticoid-induced downregulation of astrocytic FGF2, leading to a decrease in neuroligin1-dependent GluR1/2 trafficking to the synapse. This study confirms these findings by demonstrating that prenatal CUMS and corticosterone injection inhibit retinal neurogenesis and synaptogenesis, and increase A1 reactive astrocytic transformation. These findings suggest that hyperactivated A1-like astrocytes and insufficient FGF2 signaling drive impaired retinal neurogenesis and excitatory synapse loss.Vision impairment can occur in humans due to stress, with the associated mechanisms best understood in conditions such as glaucoma and optic neuritis (Sabel et al. 2018; Marc and Stan 1990). Similar to current mouse model, retinal disorders are also associated with depression. Retinitis pigmentosa, a genetic retinal disorder characterized by the degeneration of rod and cone photoreceptors, illustrates this connection (Hartong et al. 2006). Greater visual field loss is associated with reduced physical activity, negative psychosocial status, and worsening depression (Bittner et al. 2011; Hahm et al. 2008). These associations mirror findings in the current study, where susceptible mice exhibited depression-like behavior, retinal degeneration, and worsening vision. Few studies have examined the impact of prenatal stress on vision during the postnatal period. However, the findings of the current study suggest that prenatal stress may contribute to later vision impairment, warranting further research.Glucocorticoids are used clinically to prevent retinal degeneration in adults by activating GR signaling, which suppresses microglia-mediated inflammation and protects retinal neurons (Gallina et al. 2015). Additionally, the synthetic glucocorticoid triamcinolone acetonide enhances retinal neuron survival in adult animals by preventing neovascularization at the blood-retinal barrier (Wijk et al. 2019). Glucocorticoids also protect neurons by suppressing apoptotic pathways (Sulaiman et al. 2018). However, these effects are associated with the short-term, topical use of glucocorticoids under normal HPA function, rather than the chronic exposure that occurs in response to chronic stress and HPA dysregulation. Chronic stress in adults may lead to retinal degeneration owing to a GR-resistant environment, requiring further investigation. Furthermore, with age, the HPA axis becomes overactive, and the retina can be affected by constant exposure to elevated glucocorticoids. Moreover, glia-mediated inflammation increases the risk of retinal degeneration (Dhodapkar et al. 2022). Therefore, identifying genes related to HPA overactivation could help develop treatments to suppress prenatal stress-induced retinal degeneration. We did not examine retinal changes in mice exhibiting only memory impairment or depression-like behavior, as this phenotype was considered undefined, and these mice were excluded. These undefined mice might exhibit neurodevelopment deficits, affecting the retina and hippocampus. Another limitation of this study is that we only examined the effects on ganglion cells. Additional research is required to explore the differences in genetic and epigenetic profiles specific to the stress-susceptible group, as these results may help reveal the underlying molecular mechanisms of prenatal stress susceptibility.

## Conclusion

Our study underscores the deleterious effects of chronic prenatal stress on retinal development and vision. Similar to humans, experimental mice can be divided into resilient and susceptible groups with highly divergent outcomes following prenatal stress. The susceptible group exhibited cognitive and mood disorders, elevated corticosterone levels, disrupted retinal development, and visual impairments during growth. Identifying the genes and epigenic mechanisms underlying stress susceptibility may lead to the development of more effective treatments for stress-associated diseases, including vision disorders.
