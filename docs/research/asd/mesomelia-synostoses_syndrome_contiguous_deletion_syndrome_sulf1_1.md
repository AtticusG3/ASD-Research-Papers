## Abstract

## Methods
We present a boy with a global development deficit, delayed speech development and an ASD (Asperger) family history, with an apparently balanced "de novo" reciprocal translocation [t(1;8)(p32.2;q13)dn]. The cytogenetic molecular study identified a likely pathogenic deletion of 21 kb in the 15q12 region, while mate pair sequencing identified gene-truncations at both the 1p32.2 and 8q13 translocation breakpoints.
The identification of a pathogenic alteration on 15q12 involving GABRA5 was likely the main cause of the ASD-phenotype. Importantly, the chr8 translocation breakpoint truncating SLCO5A1 exclude SLCO5A1 as a candidate for MSS, leaving SULF1 as the primary candidate. However, the deletions observed in MSS remove a topological associated domain (TAD) boundary separating SULF1 and SLCO5A1. Hence, Mesomelia-Synostoses syndrome is either caused by haploinsufficiency of SULF1 or ectopic enhancer effects where skeletal/chrondrogenic SULF1 enhancers drive excopic expression of developmental genes in adjacent TADs including PRDM14, NCOA2 and/or EYA1.
