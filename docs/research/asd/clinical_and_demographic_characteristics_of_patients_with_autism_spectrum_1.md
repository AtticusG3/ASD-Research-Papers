## Abstract

Perioperative management of patients with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) often requires premedication and physical restraint. This study examined the characteristics of patients with ASD who required special interventions for general anesthesia, particularly physical restraint during induction.
## Methods
A total of 136 procedures were performed on 102 patients. Median age was 23.3 years (interquartile range: 12.8-35.2), 79% of participants were male, and approximately 40% exhibited self-injurious or aggressive behaviors. Dental procedures were the most common indication for anesthesia. Midazolam and pentobarbital were the most frequently administered premedications. Patients requiring physical restraint were generally larger and more likely to exhibit self-injurious or aggressive behaviors than those who did not. However, induction times were not prolonged in the physical restraint group compared with the no-restraint group.
The characteristics identified in this study, such as large body size, self-injurious behavior, and aggressive behavior, may inform future research aimed at refining physical restraint use for patients with ASD.
