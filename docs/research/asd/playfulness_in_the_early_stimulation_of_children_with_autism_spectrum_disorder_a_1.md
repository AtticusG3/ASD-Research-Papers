## Abstract

The aim of this study was to describe systematically playful strategies and their benefits for the early stimulation of autistic children. This is a systematic review, registered on the PROSPERO platform (ID: CRD42024522420) and guided by the PRISMA protocol (2020) criteria. The databases searched were: Web of Science, Scopus, Pubmed/Medline, Latin American and Caribbean Literature in Health Sciences (LILACS), and Scientific Electronic Library Online (SciELO); original articles published between 2018-2023 were included. Eighteen articles that met the eligibility criteria were selected from the 1,043 studies located. The population sample included 822 children (94% with ASD, along with paired neurotypical children) from 8 countries, and most studies applied standardized scales to define and/or confirm the diagnoses. The main benefits of playfulness in the stimulation of these children were: improvement of social and socio-emotional aspects, social engagement, development of symbolic and narrative play skills, engagement in pretend play, as well as improvement of motor skills and executive functions, which reflect in autonomy for daily activities. The importance of playful interventions in promoting the cognitive, social, and emotional development of children with ASD is highlighted.
