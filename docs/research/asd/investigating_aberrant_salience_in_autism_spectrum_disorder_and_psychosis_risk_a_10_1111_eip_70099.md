## Abstract

This study investigates the expression of aberrant salience (AS) in individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), those at clinical high risk for psychosis (CHR-P) and help-seeking individuals without formal diagnoses. Ninety-nine participants, 44 males and 55 females (age range 17-39 years), met the inclusion criteria of absence of major neurological disorders, intellectual disabilities or substance-related conditions. None were receiving antipsychotic treatment. Based on clinical evaluations, participants were categorised into three groups: ASD (n = 23), Attenuated Psychosis Syndrome (APS) (n = 27) and help-seekers (n = 49). The Aberrant Salience Inventory (ASI) was administered. Significant differences were observed in ASI total and subscale scores among groups. Post hoc analyses showed significantly higher ASI scores in the ASD and APS groups compared to help-seekers, but no significant differences between ASD and APS. These findings suggest an overlap in AS processing between ASD and psychosis-spectrum conditions, supporting AS as a transdiagnostic construct.
