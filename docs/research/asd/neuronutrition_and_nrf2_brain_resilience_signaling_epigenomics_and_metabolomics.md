## Abstract

Neuronutrition to improve brain resilience to stress and human health has received considerable attention. The use of specific nutrients is effective in preventing and slowing neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric disorders. Selective neuronutrients, including polyphenols, short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), tryptophan, tyrosine, and sulfur metabolites, can modulate the dysregulated nuclear factor erythroid 2 (Nrf2) pathway through neuroepigenetic modifications and altered levels of neurotransmitters such as serotonin, melatonin, and dopamine. In particular, abnormal epigenetic alterations in the promoter function of the NFE2L2/Nrf2 gene may contribute to the onset and progression of various diseases by disrupting cellular homeostasis. Recent evidence has documented that polyphenols are capable of modulating Nrf2 signaling; to do this, they must reverse hypermethylation in the CpG islands of the NFE2L2 gene. This process is achieved by modifying the activity of DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) and histone deacetylases (HDACs). Furthermore, a diverse group of polyphenolic metabolites can be identified and quantified using innovative mass spectrometry platforms in both in vitro models and human urine samples to investigate redox metabolic homeostasis under physiological and pathophysiological conditions. This review aims to deepen the current understanding of the role of nutrient-derived secondary metabolites. It highlights innovative strategies to effectively prevent, slow, or potentially reverse neuroinflammation and oxidative stress, key drivers of neuronal damage. The targeted application of these metabolites can be considered a novel, personalized neuronutritional approach to promote brain health and neuronal adaptation.
