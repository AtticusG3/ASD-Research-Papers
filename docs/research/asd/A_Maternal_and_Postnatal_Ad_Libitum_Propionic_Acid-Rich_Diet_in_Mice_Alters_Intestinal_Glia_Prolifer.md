## Abstract

We previously demonstrated that propionic acid (PPA), a common food preservative and a metabolic byproduct of bacteria in dysbiosis (as seen in individuals affected with autism spectrum disorder, ASD), can lead to increased brain astrocyte proliferation and neuroinflammation in mice. We also showed that in vitro treatment of human neural stem cells with PPA increased glial cell vs. neuron differentiation and yielded a marked increase in pro-inflammatory cytokines. In this study, a group of mice (FVB/N-Tg(GFAPGFP)14Mes/J) was exposed in utero through the maternal diet and postnatally ad libitum to a PPA-rich diet, while the control group was fed a normal diet. Intestinal tissue from offspring mice at 1 month (1 M) and 5 months (5 M) were then studied for neurodifferentiation and gastrointestinal (GI) inflammation. There was a significant increase in
