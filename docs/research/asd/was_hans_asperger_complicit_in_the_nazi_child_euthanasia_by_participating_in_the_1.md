As part of the investigations, a group of children was also diagnosed as incapable of learning and developing normally based on a list prepared by Gugging's Director. According to two documents prepared for the Commission, these children were to be assigned to the "Aktion Jekelius". The two authors imply that "Aktion Jekelius" was a cover term for the murder of these children and was known as such. However, this designation was communicated only within the Reich Governor's Office in Lower Danube.Conclusion:According to the available documents, there is no indication that Hans Asperger, as a member of the Vienna delegation, knew about "Aktion Jekelius" and its hidden murderous intentions. He therefore had no reason to refuse to participate in the Commission. Analysis of the subsequent transfers of children to Spiegelgrund showed no direct connection with the Commission's activities.Keywords:Aktion Jekelius; Gugging Commission; Gugging Kommission; Hans Asperger; National Socialism in Vienna; Nationalsozialismus in Wien; child euthanasia.---
