## Abstract

The etiology of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) has not yet been completely elucidated. Through time, multiple attempts have been made to uncover the causes of ASD. Different theories have been proposed, such as being caused by alterations in the gut-brain axis with an emphasis on gut dysbiosis, post-vaccine complications, and genetic or even autoimmune causes. In this review, we present data covering the main streams that focus on ASD etiology. Data collection occurred in many countries covering ethnically diverse subjects. Moreover, we aimed to show how the progress in genetic techniques influences the explanation of medical White Papers in the ASD area. There is no single evidence-based pathway that results in symptoms of ASD. Patient management has constantly only been symptomatic, and there is no ASD screening apart from symptom-based diagnosis and parent-mediated interventions. Multigene sequencing or epigenetic alterations hold promise in solving the disjointed molecular puzzle. Further research is needed, especially in the field of biogenetics and metabolomic aspects, because young children constitute the patient group most affected by ASD. In summary, to date, molecular research has confirmed multigene dysfunction as the causative factor of ASD, the multigene model with metabolomic influence would explain the heterogeneity in ASD, and it is proposed that ion channel dysfunction could play a core role in ASD pathogenesis.
