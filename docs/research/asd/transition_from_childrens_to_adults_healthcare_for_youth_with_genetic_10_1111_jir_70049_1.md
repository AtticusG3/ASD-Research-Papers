## Abstract

For young people with rare genetic neurodevelopmental disorders associated with intellectual disabilities, the transfer from paediatric to adult healthcare providers is often complicated. The European Reference Network ERN-ITHACA (Intellectual disability, TeleHealth, Autism and Congenital Anomalies) on Rare Congenital Malformations and Rare Intellectual Disability aims to improve this transition through the development of a guideline.
## Discussion
NICE guideline recommendations were adopted or adapted to the target population where necessary. New recommendations were formulated regarding the involvement of and assistance for young people and their families/caregivers, the coordination of interdisciplinary care, the role of centres of expertise, recommended interventions and psychosocial support.
Planned, coordinated, specialised, individualised and interdisciplinary healthcare is required to support young people with (genetic) intellectual disabilities. Active collaboration between healthcare providers, researchers and individuals with lived experience is essential both to improve current healthcare and to build a stronger evidence base for successful transition interventions going forward.
