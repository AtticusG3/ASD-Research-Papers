## Abstract

Mother-infant skin-to-skin contact (SSC) improves developmental and cognitive outcomes in preterm infants. However, the effects of SSC on healthy term infants remain unclear. We aim to investigate the short-term and long-term impacts of SSC in full-term infants to provide supporting data emphasising the importance of mother-infant SSC in South Korea.
This study is a prospective, double-blind, randomised controlled trial. A total of 130 mothers and their healthy term infants will be recruited after birth. Participants will be randomised to the intervention (SSC) or control groups. Participants in both groups will be instructed on general newborn care guidance and requested to record the same in a mobile diary app daily for 2 weeks after hospital discharge. The intervention group will be educated on the importance and clinical advantages of mother-infant SSC and provided with practical guidance, along with an informational pamphlet. They will also be informed to engage in a minimum of 6 hours of SSC per day with the infant's and mother's chests exposed and in contact for at least 15 min per session and to keep a record of the contact time. Breastfeeding rate, time spent on SSC and holding clothed infant, maternal depression, anxiety and bonding scores will be measured. Infants' growth, temperament and neurodevelopmental outcomes will be assessed. In addition, artificial intelligence algorithms will be developed to analyse infant movements captured in videos.
This study was approved by the institutional review board of the Korea University Anam Hospital (2024AN0613), and the results will be disseminated through scientific conferences and publications.

introduction mother-infant skin-to-skin contact (ssc) improves developmental and cognitive outcomes in preterm infants. however, the effects of ssc on healthy term infants remain unclear. we aim to investigate the short-term and long-term impacts of ssc in full-term infants to provide supporting data emphasising the importance of mother-infant ssc in south korea. methods and analysis this study is a prospective, double-blind, randomised controlled trial. a total of 130 mothers and their healthy term infants will be recruited after birth. participants will be randomised to the intervention (ssc) or control groups. participants in both groups will be instructed on general newborn care guidance and requested to record the same in a mobile diary app daily for 2 weeks after hospital discharge. the intervention group will be educated on the importance and clinical advantages of mother-infant ssc and provided with practical guidance, along with an informational pamphlet. they will also be informed to engage in a minimum of 6 hours of ssc per day with the infant’s and mother’s chests exposed and in contact for at least 15 min per session and to keep a record of the contact time. breastfeeding rate, time spent on ssc and holding clothed infant, maternal depression, anxiety and bonding scores will be measured. infants’ growth, temperament and neurodevelopmental outcomes will be assessed. in addition, artificial intelligence algorithms will be developed to analyse infant movements captured in videos. ethics and dissemination this study was approved by the institutional review

parents randomized controlled trial strengths and limitations of this study this study employs a prospective, double-blind, randomised controlled trial design that strengthens causal inference and minimises selection and observer bias. both maternal outcomes (depression, anxiety and bonding) and infant outcomes (growth, temperament and neurodevelopment) will be assessed using multidimensional and validated measures. standardised and validated tools will be used to assess maternal mental health, infant development and mother-infant bonding. the use of a mobile diary app will facilitate real-time longitudinal data collection on caregiving behaviours and enhance participant engagement. relying on a single-centre study with self-reported data on skin-to-skin contact and potential variations in adherence may limit the generalisability and accuracy of our findings. introduction breastfeeding provides significant long-term health benefits for both infants and mothers. 1 the who recommends exclusive breastfeeding of infants for the first 6 months and continued breastfeeding for ≥2 years. 2 3 data from 2020 indicated notably high rates of exclusive or partial breastfeeding at 6 months in nordic countries such as norway (78%), finland (76%), iceland (76%) and sweden (63%). 4 in contrast, south korea has experienced a significant decrease in breastfeeding rates, mirroring its declining birth rate. the korea institute for health and social affairs reported a 6-month breastfeeding rate of 36.7% in 2018, which further decreased to 26% in 2021. 5 6 exclusive breastfeeding rates at 6 months in south korea are particularly concerning, with the country ranking the lowest (2%) among 14 high-income countries in a 2021 study, compared with 39% in both the netherlands and spain. 4 this finding highlights the urgent need for targeted social interventions to promote breastfeeding rates in south korea. skin-to-skin contact (ssc), which involves placing naked babies on the mother’s bare chest to allow skin contact, has been recommended by the who for all newborns immediately after birth since 2003. 7 ssc increases breastfeeding rates effectively both in preterm and term infants. 7–10 in preterm infants admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit, ssc was associated with better developmental and cognitive outcomes. 11 12 however, there is a lack of research examining the long-term impact of ssc on neurobehavioural or cognitive outcomes in term infants. 13 south korea’s unique postpartum culture presents a significant barrier to the promotion of ssc and breastfeeding. 14 15 according to a korean government report, in 2024, 85.5% of postpartum women used postpartum care centres, and the mean duration spent in these centres was 12.6 days. in postpartum care centres, mothers have the option to either stay with their baby in the same room (rooming-in) or have the baby stay in a nursery for the duration of their stay. mothers used these centres for self-recovery (91.2%), acquisition of baby care skills (6.2%) and mother-infant intimacy or attachment (2.2%). 16 this observation was reflected in the low rate of rooming-in (3%) among postpartum women according to a 2018 report. 17 many mothers consider their stay at postpartum care centres as an opportunity to rest and recover without parenting responsibilities; hence, they do not desire to practise mother-infant attachment. 14 15 18 as a result, babies are separated from their mothers and cared for in nurseries. 18 this cultural practice possibly contributes to south korea’s low breastfeeding rates, given the reported link between rooming-in and exclusive breastfeeding. 19 during the 1980s and 1990s, many nordic and western countries eliminated or significantly reduced the use of nurseries. this shift emphasised family-centred care, prioritising minimal separation between infants and their mothers, and resulted in recommendations to phase out neonatal nurseries. this transition fostered the mother-infant bond and improved the infant’s clinical outcomes. 12 20 from this perspective, south korea’s postpartum culture is a regression, countering the times. despite the lowest birth rate in the world, south korea has the lowest breastfeeding rate, and neonatal care is contrary to global trends. this double-blind, parallel-group, randomised controlled trial (rct) aims to investigate the short-term and long-term effects of mother-infant ssc in healthy term infants and to offer evidence that supports prioritising mother-infant closeness and skin contact during the first few weeks in postpartum care centres in south korea. the primary goal of this study is to examine whether mother-infant ssc is more effective than standard care in increasing the breastfeeding rate in healthy term infants. the secondary goal includes the various effects of ssc implemented during the neonatal period on maternal postpartum depression, anxiety levels and mother-infant intimacy. we will also explore the long-term effects of ssc on growth, temperament and cognitive and behavioural development of infants. methods and analysis study design this is a prospective, double-blind, rct with two parallel groups (intervention and control). the ssc intervention will begin after discharge to home or a postpartum care centre and continues for 2 weeks. maternal and infant outcomes will be measured at 1, 4, 8, 12, 24 and 36 months of age. the expected total duration of the study from the start of recruitment to the last participant finishing the assessment is 5 years. outcome measures primary outcome. any breastfeeding (combined with formula and/or solid or not) at 4 months of infant age. secondary outcomes. any breastfeeding (combined with formula and/or solid or not) at 1, 8 and 12 months of infant age. maternal depression score measured using the korean-edinburgh postnatal depression scale at 3–6 days, 1 month and 4 months of infant age. 21 maternal anxiety level measured using the korean-state-trait anxiety inventory at 3–6 days, 1, 4, 8 and 12 months of infant age. 22 mother-infant intimacy was measured using the korean-maternal postnatal attachment scale at 1, 4, 8 and 12 months of infant age. 23 tertiary outcomes (long-term infant outcomes). infant growth of weight, height and head circumference until 36 months. the infants’ general developmental screening score was measured using the korean-developmental screening test at 4, 8, 12, 24 and 36 months. 24 infant autism spectrum screening results—measured using the korean modified checklist for autism in toddlers revised version at 24 and 36 months. 25 infant behaviour assessment results—using the korean-child behaviour checklist at 24 and 36 months. 26 infant temperament—using the korean-infant behaviour questionnaire-revised at 8 months and the korean-early childhood behaviour questionnaire-revised at 24 months. 27 infant motor, cognitive and social development—measured at 24 and 36 months using the korean-bayley scales of infant and toddler development third edition (k-bsid-iii) at 24 and 36 months. 28 infant language development—using the korean sequenced language scale for infants (k-selsi) at 24 and 36 months. 29 artificial intelligence (ai) analysis of infant movement videos obtained at 3–6 days, 1 month and 4 months. sample size calculation the sample size was calculated based on reports of a 25.9% breastfeeding rate in south korean infants at 4 months 6 and a study showing that ssc for 15–90 min increased the breastfeeding rates 2.6-fold. 30 using g*power v.3.1 (heinrich-heine-universität düsseldorf, düsseldorf, germany), with a power of 95% and significance level of 0.05, the calculated sample size for each group was 40 participants. assuming a dropout rate of 15%, a follow-up failure rate of 15% and a protocol non-compliance rate of 15%, 65 participants per group were required. the target sample size is 130 participants (65 mothers and their infants in each group). patient and public involvement prior to commencing the study design, we conducted focus group interviews with women in early postpartum periods, local residents with experience in using postpartum care centres and managers of postpartum care centres to develop a community-guided research strategy on ssc for healthy term infants. these inputs influenced the design and creation of a mobile diary app and the development of educational resources for the participants. the findings of this study will be publicly disseminated to community members and personnel at postpartum care centres in korea. participants and recruitment a total of 130 participant pairs will be recruited from eligible mothers and infants admitted to the nursery of korea university anam hospital within 72 hours after delivery by obtaining written informed consent. all eligible subjects will be screened to achieve the target number of participants. the inclusion and exclusion criteria are presented in table 1 . to reliably evaluate the effects of ssc in a typical postpartum care setting, we will include healthy mother-infant pairs. we will select mothers without acute postpartum complications and single pregnancies to reduce confounding factors. limiting participants to married mothers will ensure consistent psychosocial support, which may influence maternal outcomes. included infants will be term-born (≥37 weeks gestation), weigh ≥2500 g at birth and have apgar scores ≥7 at 5 min after birth. we will exclude patients who require intensive care to minimise medical confounders. these criteria will enable a rigorous assessment of the short-term and long-term effects of ssc within the context of south korean postpartum care. view this table: view inline view popup table 1 inclusion and exclusion criteria the baseline clinical data for the mother and newborn at the time of participant registration are as follows: maternal data including age, address, history of infertility treatment, medical history (chronic hypertension, diabetes), obstetric history, parity, gravidity, antenatal antibiotics (type and duration of antibiotics used), other medications, pre-eclampsia, gestational diabetes, rupture of membranes and duration, oligohydramnios, mode of delivery, alcohol consumption and smoking during pregnancy, highest level of education and occupation of the women and their partners, and plan for postpartum care centre admission. neonatal data, including date of birth, sex, gestational age, birth weight, height, head circumference, small-for-gestational-age or large-for-gestational-age, 1 min and 5 min apgar scores and birth order. randomisation and blinding participants will be randomised to either the intervention or control group after recruitment. randomisation will be carried out by an investigator from the department of preventive medicine who does not have direct contact with the mothers or their infants. a computer programme will be used to randomly assign participants to two groups using permuted blocks (4 and 6) stratified by first-born and subsequent-born infants, with a 1:1 random allocation. the assigned groups will be communicated to the researchers dedicated to parent education at the site. participants will be blinded to their assigned group, and the study will be described as an investigation of the infant’s sleep, feeding, bonding and overall health, so as not to influence mother-infant contact time. to minimise potential bias, all personnel responsible for scoring and evaluating the outcomes will also be blinded to group allocation, except for the researchers providing education to the control and intervention groups. to ensure proper allocation concealment, the randomisation sequence will remain concealed until the study is complete. intervention and control groups’ condition typically, postpartum mothers and healthy infants are discharged from the hospital 3–6 days after delivery. one dedicated investigator will deliver newborn care education and information on the mobile diary app to the enrolled mothers on the day of discharge, according to their study group. both the intervention and control groups will be educated on general information about infant sleep, breastfeeding and bathing. mothers in both groups will be requested to fill out the same mobile diary app daily for 2 weeks after discharge. the mobile diary app named “my baby diary” documents the following: feeding type and amount (breastfeeding or formula), frequency of diaper change (urine or stool), sleep time, crying time and holding time as clothed and ssc time. for the intervention group, additional instruction will be provided along with an informational pamphlet emphasising the importance and clinical advantages of mother-infant ssc, and participants will be given the opportunity to practise ssc according to established practice guidelines before discharge. they will be informed to engage in a minimum of 6 hours of ssc per day with the infant’s and mother’s chests exposed for at least 15 min per session and to keep a record of the contact time. timeline an overview

flow. ssc, skin-to-skin contact. data handling and confidentiality all study data will be recorded in electronic case-record forms (ecrfs). data corrections will be performed according to the instructions and timeline. the investigators will be trained in the study requirements, including capturing infant movement videos, counselling for adherence and the eliciting of information from study participants in a uniform, reproducible manner. the data to be collected and the procedures to be conducted will be reviewed in detail. each of the data collection forms and the nature of the required information will be discussed in detail on an item-by-item basis. entering data forms, responding to data discrepancy queries and general information about obtaining research-quality data will also be covered during the training session. data integrity will be enforced through referential data rules, range checks and consistency checks. checks will be applied at the time of data entry into a specific field and/or before the data is saved to the database. modifications to data written to the database will be documented through either the data change system or an inquiry system. data entered into the database will be retrievable for viewing through the data entry app. the type of activity that an individual user may undertake is regulated by the privileges associated with his/her user identification code and password. data errors will be detected by programmes designed to detect missing data or specific errors in the data. these errors will be summarised along with detailed descriptions for each specific problem in data query reports, which will be sent to the study investigators. and study staff who receive the inquiry will respond by checking the original forms for inconsistency, checking other sources to determine the correction, modifying the original form and entering a response to the query. the investigators will be asked to confirm the accuracy of the completed crfs by signing key crfs as indicated. the source documents will be securely stored on a local encrypted server to maintain confidentiality. the only study documents containing participants’ names are the enrolment and informed consent forms. hard copies of the data forms will remain locked when not being actively used. access to data files that include personal identification details will be restricted to the principal investigators and essential study personnel. all study-related documentation will be maintained for at least 3 years following the completion of the study. data analysis plan continuous values will be summarised as means with sd or medians with iqr. categorical variables will be summarised as the proportion of participants in each category. a primary comparative analysis of the two groups will be conducted according to the intention-to-treat principle. secondary as-treated analyses could be incorporated to enhance the robustness of the study findings. the patterns of missing data will be checked before analysis. all measurements will be controlled for outliers and checked for normality. differences between the two groups of categorical variables will be analysed using the χ 2 test or fisher’s exact test, whereas continuous variables will be assessed using an independent t-test or the mann-whitney u test. multivariate logistic regression analysis will be employed to compare the two groups. the level of significance for the study is 5% (two-sided) for all analyses. ai-powered analysis of infant movements ai algorithms will be developed to analyse infant’s whole body movements captured in videos. computer vision techniques will be used to track key joint movements and extract relevant kinematic features, including joint positions, velocities and movement patterns. machine learning models will then be trained to identify deviations from typical movement patterns. although the assessment captures motor characteristics similar to those evaluated by the general movements assessment, the automated approach provides enhanced precision and consistency compared with traditional expert-based observational methods. the system’s performance will be rigorously evaluated against longitudinal developmental outcome measures. this advanced predictive modeling aims not only to replicate but also to extend the predictive capabilities of existing standardised assessment tools for the early identification of infants at risk for neurodevelopmental impairments. study coordination and monitoring once the subject is enrolled and randomised, the study personnel will make every reasonable effort to follow the mother and infant for the entire study period. this will include regular contact through scheduled visits, phone calls and monitoring of adherence to the study protocol to ensure the completeness and accuracy of data collection. compliance will be monitored using data recorded by the mother in a mobile diary app during the study period, including the time spent on ssc and time spent on holding the clothed infant. participants will be provided with monetary incentives for their involvement. this will include a 50 000 krw transportation allowance for each visit and dessert coupons worth approximately 20 000 krw for completing mobile surveys. as part of the study, enrolled infants will receive complimentary developmental assessments, specifically two k-bsid-iii tests (valued at 100 000 krw each) and two k-selsi tests (valued at 50 000 krw each), performed by trained professionals. written feedback about the infant development assessment results will be given to all included mothers. participants can withdraw from the study for any reason at any time. the investigator may also withdraw participants from the study if they are unwilling or unable to comply with required study procedures after consultation with the study staff. this study will be monitored by the clinical trial centre of the korea university anam hospital, seoul, south korea. independent data and safety monitoring committee members, blinded to the intervention arms, will conduct monitoring every 6 months to assess participants’ safety and trial progress, including recruitment, dropout, follow-up failure and adherence to the protocol. ethics and dissemination this study was reviewed and approved by the institutional review board (irb) of korea university anam hospital (irb no. 2024an0613). written informed consent will be obtained from the mothers of healthy term infants ( online supplemental

mother-infant skin-to-skin contact (ssc) improves developmental and cognitive outcomes in preterm infants. however, the effects of ssc on healthy term infants remain unclear. we aim to investigate the short-term and long-term impacts of ssc in full-term infants to provide supporting data emphasising the importance of mother-infant ssc in south korea. methods and analysis this study is a prospective, double-blind, randomised controlled trial. a total of 130 mothers and their healthy term infants will be recruited after birth. participants will be randomised to the intervention (ssc) or control groups. participants in both groups will be instructed on general newborn care guidance and requested to record the same in a mobile diary app daily for 2 weeks after hospital discharge. the intervention group will be educated on the importance and clinical advantages of mother-infant ssc and provided with practical guidance, along with an informational pamphlet. they will also be informed to engage in a minimum of 6 hours of ssc per day with the infant’s and mother’s chests exposed and in contact for at least 15 min per session and to keep a record of the contact time. breastfeeding rate, time spent on ssc and holding clothed infant, maternal depression, anxiety and bonding scores will be measured. infants’ growth, temperament and neurodevelopmental outcomes will be assessed. in addition, artificial intelligence algorithms will be developed to analyse infant movements captured in videos. ethics and dissemination this study was approved by the institutional review board of the korea university anam hospital (2024an0613), and the results will be disseminated through scientific conferences and publications. trial registration number nct06777524 , registered on 14

parents randomized controlled trial strengths and limitations of this study this study employs a prospective, double-blind, randomised controlled trial design that strengthens causal inference and minimises selection and observer bias. both maternal outcomes (depression, anxiety and bonding) and infant outcomes (growth, temperament and neurodevelopment) will be assessed using multidimensional and validated measures. standardised and validated tools will be used to assess maternal mental health, infant development and mother-infant bonding. the use of a mobile diary app will facilitate real-time longitudinal data collection on caregiving behaviours and enhance participant engagement. relying on a single-centre study with self-reported data on skin-to-skin contact and potential variations in adherence may limit the generalisability and accuracy of our findings. introduction breastfeeding provides significant long-term health benefits for both infants and mothers. 1 the who recommends exclusive breastfeeding of infants for the first 6 months and continued breastfeeding for ≥2 years. 2 3 data from 2020 indicated notably high rates of exclusive or partial breastfeeding at 6 months in nordic countries such as norway (78%), finland (76%), iceland (76%) and sweden (63%). 4 in contrast, south korea has experienced a significant decrease in breastfeeding rates, mirroring its declining birth rate. the korea institute for health and social affairs reported a 6-month breastfeeding rate of 36.7% in 2018, which further decreased to 26% in 2021. 5 6 exclusive breastfeeding rates at 6 months in south korea are particularly concerning, with the country ranking the lowest (2%) among 14 high-income countries in a 2021 study, compared with 39% in both the netherlands and spain. 4 this finding highlights the urgent need for targeted social interventions to promote breastfeeding rates in south korea. skin-to-skin contact (ssc), which involves placing naked babies on the mother’s bare chest to allow skin contact, has been recommended by the who for all newborns immediately after birth since 2003. 7 ssc increases breastfeeding rates effectively both in preterm and term infants. 7–10 in preterm infants admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit, ssc was associated with better developmental and cognitive outcomes. 11 12 however, there is a lack of research examining the long-term impact of ssc on neurobehavioural or cognitive outcomes in term infants. 13 south korea’s unique postpartum culture presents a significant barrier to the promotion of ssc and breastfeeding. 14 15 according to a korean government report, in 2024, 85.5% of postpartum women used postpartum care centres, and the mean duration spent in these centres was 12.6 days. in postpartum care centres, mothers have the option to either stay with their baby in the same room (rooming-in) or have the baby stay in a nursery for the duration of their stay. mothers used these centres for self-recovery (91.2%), acquisition of baby care skills (6.2%) and mother-infant intimacy or attachment (2.2%). 16 this observation was reflected in the low rate of rooming-in (3%) among postpartum women according to a 2018 report. 17 many mothers consider their stay at postpartum care centres as an opportunity to rest and recover without parenting responsibilities; hence, they do not desire to practise mother-infant attachment. 14 15 18 as a result, babies are separated from their mothers and cared for in nurseries. 18 this cultural practice possibly contributes to south korea’s low breastfeeding rates, given the reported link between rooming-in and exclusive breastfeeding. 19 during the 1980s and 1990s, many nordic and western countries eliminated or significantly reduced the use of nurseries. this shift emphasised family-centred care, prioritising minimal separation between infants and their mothers, and resulted in recommendations to phase out neonatal nurseries. this transition fostered the mother-infant bond and improved the infant’s clinical outcomes. 12 20 from this perspective, south korea’s postpartum culture is a regression, countering the times. despite the lowest birth rate in the world, south korea has the lowest breastfeeding rate, and neonatal care is contrary to global trends. this double-blind, parallel-group, randomised controlled trial (rct) aims to investigate the short-term and long-term effects of mother-infant ssc in healthy term infants and to offer evidence that supports prioritising mother-infant closeness and skin contact during the first few weeks in postpartum care centres in south korea. the primary goal of this study is to examine whether mother-infant ssc is more effective than standard care in increasing the breastfeeding rate in healthy term infants. the secondary goal includes the various effects of ssc implemented during the neonatal period on maternal postpartum depression, anxiety levels and mother-infant intimacy. we will also explore the long-term effects of ssc on growth, temperament and cognitive and behavioural development of infants. methods and analysis study design this is a prospective, double-blind, rct with two parallel groups (intervention and control). the ssc intervention will begin after discharge to home or a postpartum care centre and continues for 2 weeks. maternal and infant outcomes will be measured at 1, 4, 8, 12, 24 and 36 months of age. the expected total duration of the study from the start of recruitment to the last participant finishing the assessment is 5 years. outcome measures primary outcome. any breastfeeding (combined with formula and/or solid or not) at 4 months of infant age. secondary outcomes. any breastfeeding (combined with formula and/or solid or not) at 1, 8 and 12 months of infant age. maternal depression score measured using the korean-edinburgh postnatal depression scale at 3–6 days, 1 month and 4 months of infant age. 21 maternal anxiety level measured using the korean-state-trait anxiety inventory at 3–6 days, 1, 4, 8 and 12 months of infant age. 22 mother-infant intimacy was measured using the korean-maternal postnatal attachment scale at 1, 4, 8 and 12 months of infant age. 23 tertiary outcomes (long-term infant outcomes). infant growth of weight, height and head circumference until 36 months. the infants’ general developmental screening score was measured using the korean-developmental screening test at 4, 8, 12, 24 and 36 months. 24 infant autism spectrum screening results—measured using the korean modified checklist for autism in toddlers revised version at 24 and 36 months. 25 infant behaviour assessment results—using the korean-child behaviour checklist at 24 and 36 months. 26 infant temperament—using the korean-infant behaviour questionnaire-revised at 8 months and the korean-early childhood behaviour questionnaire-revised at 24 months. 27 infant motor, cognitive and social development—measured at 24 and 36 months using the korean-bayley scales of infant and toddler development third edition (k-bsid-iii) at 24 and 36 months. 28 infant language development—using the korean sequenced language scale for infants (k-selsi) at 24 and 36 months. 29 artificial intelligence (ai) analysis of infant movement videos obtained at 3–6 days, 1 month and 4 months. sample size calculation the sample size was calculated based on reports of a 25.9% breastfeeding rate in south korean infants at 4 months 6 and a study showing that ssc for 15–90 min increased the breastfeeding rates 2.6-fold. 30 using g*power v.3.1 (heinrich-heine-universität düsseldorf, düsseldorf, germany), with a power of 95% and significance level of 0.05, the calculated sample size for each group was 40 participants. assuming a dropout rate of 15%, a follow-up failure rate of 15% and a protocol non-compliance rate of 15%, 65 participants per group were required. the target sample size is 130 participants (65 mothers and their infants in each group). patient and public involvement prior to commencing the study design, we conducted focus group interviews with women in early postpartum periods, local residents with experience in using postpartum care centres and managers of postpartum care centres to develop a community-guided research strategy on ssc for healthy term infants. these inputs influenced the design and creation of a mobile diary app and the development of educational resources for the participants. the findings of this study will be publicly disseminated to community members and personnel at postpartum care centres in korea. participants and recruitment a total of 130 participant pairs will be recruited from eligible mothers and infants admitted to the nursery of korea university anam hospital within 72 hours after delivery by obtaining written informed consent. all eligible subjects will be screened to achieve the target number of participants. the inclusion and exclusion criteria are presented in table 1 . to reliably evaluate the effects of ssc in a typical postpartum care setting, we will include healthy mother-infant pairs. we will select mothers without acute postpartum complications and single pregnancies to reduce confounding factors. limiting participants to married mothers will ensure consistent psychosocial support, which may influence maternal outcomes. included infants will be term-born (≥37 weeks gestation), weigh ≥2500 g at birth and have apgar scores ≥7 at 5 min after birth. we will exclude patients who require intensive care to minimise medical confounders. these criteria will enable a rigorous assessment of the short-term and long-term effects of ssc within the context of south korean postpartum care. view this table: view inline view popup table 1 inclusion and exclusion criteria the baseline clinical data for the mother and newborn at the time of participant registration are as follows: maternal data including age, address, history of infertility treatment, medical history (chronic hypertension, diabetes), obstetric history, parity, gravidity, antenatal antibiotics (type and duration of antibiotics used), other medications, pre-eclampsia, gestational diabetes, rupture of membranes and duration, oligohydramnios, mode of delivery, alcohol consumption and smoking during pregnancy, highest level of education and occupation of the women and their partners, and plan for postpartum care centre admission. neonatal data, including date of birth, sex, gestational age, birth weight, height, head circumference, small-for-gestational-age or large-for-gestational-age, 1 min and 5 min apgar scores and birth order. randomisation and blinding participants will be randomised to either the intervention or control group after recruitment. randomisation will be carried out by an investigator from the department of preventive medicine who does not have direct contact with the mothers or their infants. a computer programme will be used to randomly assign participants to two groups using permuted blocks (4 and 6) stratified by first-born and subsequent-born infants, with a 1:1 random allocation. the assigned groups will be communicated to the researchers dedicated to parent education at the site. participants will be blinded to their assigned group, and the study will be described as an investigation of the infant’s sleep, feeding, bonding and overall health, so as not to influence mother-infant contact time. to minimise potential bias, all personnel responsible for scoring and evaluating the outcomes will also be blinded to group allocation, except for the researchers providing education to the control and intervention groups. to ensure proper allocation concealment, the randomisation sequence will remain concealed until the study is complete. intervention and control groups’ condition typically, postpartum mothers and healthy infants are discharged from the hospital 3–6 days after delivery. one dedicated investigator will deliver newborn care education and information on the mobile diary app to the enrolled mothers on the day of discharge, according to their study group. both the intervention and control groups will be educated on general information about infant sleep, breastfeeding and bathing. mothers in both groups will be requested to fill out the same mobile diary app daily for 2 weeks after discharge. the mobile diary app named “my baby diary” documents the following: feeding type and amount (breastfeeding or formula), frequency of diaper change (urine or stool), sleep time, crying time and holding time as clothed and ssc time. for the intervention group, additional instruction will be provided along with an informational pamphlet emphasising the importance and clinical advantages of mother-infant ssc, and participants will be given the opportunity to practise ssc according to established practice guidelines before discharge. they will be informed to engage in a minimum of 6 hours of ssc per day with the infant’s and mother’s chests exposed for at least 15 min per session and to keep a record of the contact time. timeline an overview

flow. ssc, skin-to-skin contact. data handling and confidentiality all study data will be recorded in electronic case-record forms (ecrfs). data corrections will be performed according to the instructions and timeline. the investigators will be trained in the study requirements, including capturing infant movement videos, counselling for adherence and the eliciting of information from study participants in a uniform, reproducible manner. the data to be collected and the procedures to be conducted will be reviewed in detail. each of the data collection forms and the nature of the required information will be discussed in detail on an item-by-item basis. entering data forms, responding to data discrepancy queries and general information about obtaining research-quality data will also be covered during the training session. data integrity will be enforced through referential data rules, range checks and consistency checks. checks will be applied at the time of data entry into a specific field and/or before the data is saved to the database. modifications to data written to the database will be documented through either the data change system or an inquiry system. data entered into the database will be retrievable for viewing through the data entry app. the type of activity that an individual user may undertake is regulated by the privileges associated with his/her user identification code and password. data errors will be detected by programmes designed to detect missing data or specific errors in the data. these errors will be summarised along with detailed descriptions for each specific problem in data query reports, which will be sent to the study investigators. and study staff who receive the inquiry will respond by checking the original forms for inconsistency, checking other sources to determine the correction, modifying the original form and entering a response to the query. the investigators will be asked to confirm the accuracy of the completed crfs by signing key crfs as indicated. the source documents will be securely stored on a local encrypted server to maintain confidentiality. the only study documents containing participants’ names are the enrolment and informed consent forms. hard copies of the data forms will remain locked when not being actively used. access to data files that include personal identification details will be restricted to the principal investigators and essential study personnel. all study-related documentation will be maintained for at least 3 years following the completion of the study. data analysis plan continuous values will be summarised as means with sd or medians with iqr. categorical variables will be summarised as the proportion of participants in each category. a primary comparative analysis of the two groups will be conducted according to the intention-to-treat principle. secondary as-treated analyses could be incorporated to enhance the robustness of the study findings. the patterns of missing data will be checked before analysis. all measurements will be controlled for outliers and checked for normality. differences between the two groups of categorical variables will be analysed using the χ 2 test or fisher’s exact test, whereas continuous variables will be assessed using an independent t-test or the mann-whitney u test. multivariate logistic regression analysis will be employed to compare the two groups. the level of significance for the study is 5% (two-sided) for all analyses. ai-powered analysis of infant movements ai algorithms will be developed to analyse infant’s whole body movements captured in videos. computer vision techniques will be used to track key joint movements and extract relevant kinematic features, including joint positions, velocities and movement patterns. machine learning models will then be trained to identify deviations from typical movement patterns. although the assessment captures motor characteristics similar to those evaluated by the general movements assessment, the automated approach provides enhanced precision and consistency compared with traditional expert-based observational methods. the system’s performance will be rigorously evaluated against longitudinal developmental outcome measures. this advanced predictive modeling aims not only to replicate but also to extend the predictive capabilities of existing standardised assessment tools for the early identification of infants at risk for neurodevelopmental impairments. study coordination and monitoring once the subject is enrolled and randomised, the study personnel will make every reasonable effort to follow the mother and infant for the entire study period. this will include regular contact through scheduled visits, phone calls and monitoring of adherence to the study protocol to ensure the completeness and accuracy of data collection. compliance will be monitored using data recorded by the mother in a mobile diary app during the study period, including the time spent on ssc and time spent on holding the clothed infant. participants will be provided with monetary incentives for their involvement. this will include a 50 000 krw transportation allowance for each visit and dessert coupons worth approximately 20 000 krw for completing mobile surveys. as part of the study, enrolled infants will receive complimentary developmental assessments, specifically two k-bsid-iii tests (valued at 100 000 krw each) and two k-selsi tests (valued at 50 000 krw each), performed by trained professionals. written feedback about the infant development assessment results will be given to all included mothers. participants can withdraw from the study for any reason at any time. the investigator may also withdraw participants from the study if they are unwilling or unable to comply with required study procedures after consultation with the study staff. this study will be monitored by the clinical trial centre of the korea university anam hospital, seoul, south korea. independent data and safety monitoring committee members, blinded to the intervention arms, will conduct monitoring every 6 months to assess participants’ safety and trial progress, including recruitment, dropout, follow-up failure and adherence to the protocol. ethics and dissemination this study was reviewed and approved by the

and analysis this study is a prospective, double-blind, randomised controlled trial. a total of 130 mothers and their healthy term infants will be recruited after birth. participants will be randomised to the intervention (ssc) or control groups. participants in both groups will be instructed on general newborn care guidance and requested to record the same in a mobile diary app daily for 2 weeks after hospital discharge. the intervention group will be educated on the importance and clinical advantages of mother-infant ssc and provided with practical guidance, along with an informational pamphlet. they will also be informed to engage in a minimum of 6 hours of ssc per day with the infant’s and mother’s chests exposed and in contact for at least 15 min per session and to keep a record of the contact time. breastfeeding rate, time spent on ssc and holding clothed infant, maternal depression, anxiety and bonding scores will be measured. infants’ growth, temperament and neurodevelopmental outcomes will be assessed. in addition, artificial intelligence algorithms will be developed to analyse infant movements captured in videos. ethics and dissemination this study was approved by the institutional review board of the korea university anam hospital (2024an0613), and the results will be disseminated through scientific conferences and publications. trial registration

that strengthens causal inference and minimises selection and observer bias. both maternal outcomes (depression, anxiety and bonding) and infant outcomes (growth, temperament and neurodevelopment) will be assessed using multidimensional and validated measures. standardised and validated tools will be used to assess maternal mental health, infant development and mother-infant bonding. the use of a mobile diary app will facilitate real-time longitudinal data collection on caregiving behaviours and enhance participant engagement. relying on a single-centre study with self-reported data on skin-to-skin contact and potential variations in adherence may limit the generalisability and accuracy of our findings. introduction breastfeeding provides significant long-term health benefits for both infants and mothers. 1 the who recommends exclusive breastfeeding of infants for the first 6 months and continued breastfeeding for ≥2 years. 2 3 data from 2020 indicated notably high rates of exclusive or partial breastfeeding at 6 months in nordic countries such as norway (78%), finland (76%), iceland (76%) and sweden (63%). 4 in contrast, south korea has experienced a significant decrease in breastfeeding rates, mirroring its declining birth rate. the korea institute for health and social affairs reported a 6-month breastfeeding rate of 36.7% in 2018, which further decreased to 26% in 2021. 5 6 exclusive breastfeeding rates at 6 months in south korea are particularly concerning, with the country ranking the lowest (2%) among 14 high-income countries in a 2021 study, compared with 39% in both the netherlands and spain. 4 this finding highlights the urgent need for targeted social interventions to promote breastfeeding rates in south korea. skin-to-skin contact (ssc), which involves placing naked babies on the mother’s bare chest to allow skin contact, has been recommended by the who for all newborns immediately after birth since 2003. 7 ssc increases breastfeeding rates effectively both in preterm and term infants. 7–10 in preterm infants admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit, ssc was associated with better developmental and cognitive outcomes. 11 12 however, there is a lack of research examining the long-term impact of ssc on neurobehavioural or cognitive outcomes in term infants. 13 south korea’s unique postpartum culture presents a significant barrier to the promotion of ssc and breastfeeding. 14 15 according to a korean government report, in 2024, 85.5% of postpartum women used postpartum care centres, and the mean duration spent in these centres was 12.6 days. in postpartum care centres, mothers have the option to either stay with their baby in the same room (rooming-in) or have the baby stay in a nursery for the duration of their stay. mothers used these centres for self-recovery (91.2%), acquisition of baby care skills (6.2%) and mother-infant intimacy or attachment (2.2%). 16 this observation was reflected in the low rate of rooming-in (3%) among postpartum women according to a 2018 report. 17 many mothers consider their stay at postpartum care centres as an opportunity to rest and recover without parenting responsibilities; hence, they do not desire to practise mother-infant attachment. 14 15 18 as a result, babies are separated from their mothers and cared for in nurseries. 18 this cultural practice possibly contributes to south korea’s low breastfeeding rates, given the reported link between rooming-in and exclusive breastfeeding. 19 during the 1980s and 1990s, many nordic and western countries eliminated or significantly reduced the use of nurseries. this shift emphasised family-centred care, prioritising minimal separation between infants and their mothers, and resulted in recommendations to phase out neonatal nurseries. this transition fostered the mother-infant bond and improved the infant’s clinical outcomes. 12 20 from this perspective, south korea’s postpartum culture is a regression, countering the times. despite the lowest birth rate in the world, south korea has the lowest breastfeeding rate, and neonatal care is contrary to global trends. this double-blind, parallel-group, randomised controlled trial (rct) aims to investigate the short-term and long-term effects of mother-infant ssc in healthy term infants and to offer evidence that supports prioritising mother-infant closeness and skin contact during the first few weeks in postpartum care centres in south korea. the primary goal of this study is to examine whether mother-infant ssc is more effective than standard care in increasing the breastfeeding rate in healthy term infants. the secondary goal includes the various effects of ssc implemented during the neonatal period on maternal postpartum depression, anxiety levels and mother-infant intimacy. we will also explore the long-term effects of ssc on growth, temperament and cognitive and behavioural development of infants. methods and analysis study design this is a prospective, double-blind, rct with two parallel groups (intervention and control). the ssc intervention will begin after discharge to home or a postpartum care centre and continues for 2 weeks. maternal and infant outcomes will be measured at 1, 4, 8, 12, 24 and 36 months of age. the expected total duration of the study from the start of recruitment to the last participant finishing the assessment is 5 years. outcome measures primary outcome. any breastfeeding (combined with formula and/or solid or not) at 4 months of infant age. secondary outcomes. any breastfeeding (combined with formula and/or solid or not) at 1, 8 and 12 months of infant age. maternal depression score measured using the korean-edinburgh postnatal depression scale at 3–6 days, 1 month and 4 months of infant age. 21 maternal anxiety level measured using the korean-state-trait anxiety inventory at 3–6 days, 1, 4, 8 and 12 months of infant age. 22 mother-infant intimacy was measured using the korean-maternal postnatal attachment scale at 1, 4, 8 and 12 months of infant age. 23 tertiary outcomes (long-term infant outcomes). infant growth of weight, height and head circumference until 36 months. the infants’ general developmental screening score was measured using the korean-developmental screening test at 4, 8, 12, 24 and 36 months. 24 infant autism spectrum screening results—measured using the korean modified checklist for autism in toddlers revised version at 24 and 36 months. 25 infant behaviour assessment results—using the korean-child behaviour checklist at 24 and 36 months. 26 infant temperament—using the korean-infant behaviour questionnaire-revised at 8 months and the korean-early childhood behaviour questionnaire-revised at 24 months. 27 infant motor, cognitive and social development—measured at 24 and 36 months using the korean-bayley scales of infant and toddler development third edition (k-bsid-iii) at 24 and 36 months. 28 infant language development—using the korean sequenced language scale for infants (k-selsi) at 24 and 36 months. 29 artificial intelligence (ai) analysis of infant movement videos obtained at 3–6 days, 1 month and 4 months. sample size calculation the sample size was calculated based on reports of a 25.9% breastfeeding rate in south korean infants at 4 months 6 and a study showing that ssc for 15–90 min increased the breastfeeding rates 2.6-fold. 30 using g*power v.3.1 (heinrich-heine-universität düsseldorf, düsseldorf, germany), with a power of 95% and significance level of 0.05, the calculated sample size for each group was 40 participants. assuming a dropout rate of 15%, a follow-up failure rate of 15% and a protocol non-compliance rate of 15%, 65 participants per group were required. the target sample size is 130 participants (65 mothers and their infants in each group). patient and public involvement prior to commencing the study design, we conducted focus group interviews with women in early postpartum periods, local residents with experience in using postpartum care centres and managers of postpartum care centres to develop a community-guided research strategy on ssc for healthy term infants. these inputs influenced the design and creation of a mobile diary app and the development of educational resources for the participants. the findings of this study will be publicly disseminated to community members and personnel at postpartum care centres in korea. participants and recruitment a total of 130 participant pairs will be recruited from eligible mothers and infants admitted to the nursery of korea university anam hospital within 72 hours after delivery by obtaining written informed consent. all eligible subjects will be screened to achieve the target number of participants. the inclusion and exclusion criteria are presented in table 1 . to reliably evaluate the effects of ssc in a typical postpartum care setting, we will include healthy mother-infant pairs. we will select mothers without acute postpartum complications and single pregnancies to reduce confounding factors. limiting participants to married mothers will ensure consistent psychosocial support, which may influence maternal outcomes. included infants will be term-born (≥37 weeks gestation), weigh ≥2500 g at birth and have apgar scores ≥7 at 5 min after birth. we will exclude patients who require intensive care to minimise medical confounders. these criteria will enable a rigorous assessment of the short-term and long-term effects of ssc within the context of south korean postpartum care. view this table: view inline view popup table 1 inclusion and exclusion criteria the baseline clinical data for the mother and newborn at the time of participant registration are as follows: maternal data including age, address, history of infertility treatment, medical history (chronic hypertension, diabetes), obstetric history, parity, gravidity, antenatal antibiotics (type and duration of antibiotics used), other medications, pre-eclampsia, gestational diabetes, rupture of membranes and duration, oligohydramnios, mode of delivery, alcohol consumption and smoking during pregnancy, highest level of education and occupation of the women and their partners, and plan for postpartum care centre admission. neonatal data, including date of birth, sex, gestational age, birth weight, height, head circumference, small-for-gestational-age or large-for-gestational-age, 1 min and 5 min apgar scores and birth order. randomisation and blinding participants will be randomised to either the intervention or control group after recruitment. randomisation will be carried out by an investigator from the department of preventive medicine who does not have direct contact with the mothers or their infants. a computer programme will be used to randomly assign participants to two groups using permuted blocks (4 and 6) stratified by first-born and subsequent-born infants, with a 1:1 random allocation. the assigned groups will be communicated to the researchers dedicated to parent education at the site. participants will be blinded to their assigned group, and the study will be described as an investigation of the infant’s sleep, feeding, bonding and overall health, so as not to influence mother-infant contact time. to minimise potential bias, all personnel responsible for scoring and evaluating the outcomes will also be blinded to group allocation, except for the researchers providing education to the control and intervention groups. to ensure proper allocation concealment, the randomisation sequence will remain concealed until the study is complete. intervention and control groups’ condition typically, postpartum mothers and healthy infants are discharged from the hospital 3–6 days after delivery. one dedicated investigator will deliver newborn care education and information on the mobile diary app to the enrolled mothers on the day of discharge, according to their study group. both the intervention and control groups will be educated on general information about infant sleep, breastfeeding and bathing. mothers in both groups will be requested to fill out the same mobile diary app daily for 2 weeks after discharge. the mobile diary app named “my baby diary” documents the following: feeding type and amount (breastfeeding or formula), frequency of diaper change (urine or stool), sleep time, crying time and holding time as clothed and ssc time. for the intervention group, additional instruction will be provided along with an informational pamphlet emphasising the importance and clinical advantages of mother-infant ssc, and participants will be given the opportunity to practise ssc according to established practice guidelines before discharge. they will be informed to engage in a minimum of 6 hours of ssc per day with the infant’s and mother’s chests exposed for at least 15 min per session and to keep a record of the contact time. timeline an overview of the timeline is presented in figure 1 and table 2 . view this table: view inline view popup table 2 overview of study schedule download figure open in new tab download powerpoint figure 1 study flow. ssc, skin-to-skin contact. data handling and confidentiality all study data will be recorded in electronic case-record forms (ecrfs). data corrections will be performed according to the instructions and timeline. the investigators will be trained in the study requirements, including capturing infant movement videos, counselling for adherence and the eliciting of information from study participants in a uniform, reproducible manner. the data to be collected and the procedures to be conducted will be reviewed in detail. each of the data collection forms and the nature of the required information will be discussed in detail on an item-by-item basis. entering data forms, responding to data discrepancy queries and general information about obtaining research-quality data will also be covered during the training session. data integrity will be enforced through referential data rules, range checks and consistency checks. checks will be applied at the time of data entry into a specific field and/or before the data is saved to the database. modifications to data written to the database will be documented through either the data change system or an inquiry system. data entered into the database will be retrievable for viewing through the data entry app. the type of activity that an individual user may undertake is regulated by the privileges associated with his/her user identification code and password. data errors will be detected by programmes designed to detect missing data or specific errors in the data. these errors will be summarised along with detailed descriptions for each specific problem in data query reports, which will be sent to the study investigators. and study staff who receive the inquiry will respond by checking the original forms for inconsistency, checking other sources to determine the correction, modifying the original form and entering a response to the query. the investigators will be asked to confirm the accuracy of the completed crfs by signing key crfs as indicated. the source documents will be securely stored on a local encrypted server to maintain confidentiality. the only study documents containing participants’ names are the enrolment and informed consent forms. hard copies of the data forms will remain locked when not being actively used. access to data files that include personal identification details will be restricted to the principal investigators and essential study personnel. all study-related documentation will be maintained for at least 3 years following the completion of the study. data analysis plan continuous values will be summarised as means with sd or medians with iqr. categorical variables will be summarised as the proportion of participants in each category. a primary comparative analysis of the two groups will be conducted according to the intention-to-treat principle. secondary as-treated analyses could be incorporated to enhance the robustness of the study findings. the patterns of missing data will be checked before analysis. all measurements will be controlled for outliers and checked for normality. differences between the two groups of categorical variables will be analysed using the χ 2 test or fisher’s exact test, whereas continuous variables will be assessed using an independent t-test or the mann-whitney u test. multivariate logistic regression analysis will be employed to compare the two groups. the level of significance for the study is 5% (two-sided) for all analyses. ai-powered analysis of infant movements ai algorithms will be developed to analyse infant’s whole body movements captured in videos. computer vision techniques will be used to track key joint movements and extract relevant kinematic features, including joint positions, velocities and movement patterns. machine learning models will then be trained to identify deviations from typical movement patterns. although the assessment captures motor characteristics similar to those evaluated by the general movements assessment, the automated approach provides enhanced precision and consistency compared with traditional expert-based observational methods. the system’s performance will be rigorously evaluated against longitudinal developmental outcome measures. this advanced predictive modeling aims not only to replicate but also to extend the predictive capabilities of existing standardised assessment tools for the early identification of infants at risk for neurodevelopmental impairments. study coordination and monitoring once the subject is enrolled and randomised, the study personnel will make every reasonable effort to follow the mother and infant for the entire study period. this will include regular contact through scheduled visits, phone calls and monitoring of adherence to the study protocol to ensure the completeness and accuracy of data collection. compliance will be monitored using data recorded by the mother in a mobile diary app during the study period, including the time spent on ssc and time spent on holding the clothed infant. participants will be provided with monetary incentives for their involvement. this will include a 50 000 krw transportation allowance for each visit and dessert coupons worth approximately 20 000 krw for completing mobile surveys. as part of the study, enrolled infants will receive complimentary developmental assessments, specifically two k-bsid-iii tests (valued at 100 000 krw each) and two k-selsi tests (valued at 50 000 krw each), performed by trained professionals. written feedback about the infant development assessment results will be given to all included mothers. participants can withdraw from the study for any reason at any time. the investigator may also withdraw participants from the study if they are unwilling or unable to comply with required study procedures after consultation with the study staff. this study will be monitored by the clinical trial centre of the korea university anam hospital, seoul, south korea. independent data and safety monitoring committee members, blinded to the intervention arms, will conduct monitoring every 6 months to assess participants’ safety and trial progress, including recruitment, dropout, follow-up failure and adherence to the protocol. ethics and dissemination this study was reviewed and approved by the institutional review board (irb) of korea university anam hospital (irb no.

study employs a prospective, double-blind, randomised controlled trial design that strengthens causal inference and minimises selection and observer bias. both maternal outcomes (depression, anxiety and bonding) and infant outcomes (growth, temperament and neurodevelopment) will be assessed using multidimensional and validated measures. standardised and validated tools will be used to assess maternal mental health, infant development and mother-infant bonding. the use of a mobile diary app will facilitate real-time longitudinal data collection on caregiving behaviours and enhance participant engagement. relying on a single-centre study with self-reported data on skin-to-skin contact and potential variations in adherence may limit the generalisability and accuracy of our findings. introduction breastfeeding provides significant long-term health benefits for both infants and mothers. 1 the who recommends exclusive breastfeeding of infants for the first 6 months and continued breastfeeding for ≥2 years. 2 3 data from 2020 indicated notably high rates of exclusive or partial breastfeeding at 6 months in nordic countries such as norway (78%), finland (76%), iceland (76%) and sweden (63%). 4 in contrast, south korea has experienced a significant decrease in breastfeeding rates, mirroring its declining birth rate. the korea institute for health and social affairs reported a 6-month breastfeeding rate of 36.7% in 2018, which further decreased to 26% in 2021. 5 6 exclusive breastfeeding rates at 6 months in south korea are particularly concerning, with the country ranking the lowest (2%) among 14 high-income countries in a 2021 study, compared with 39% in both the netherlands and spain. 4 this finding highlights the urgent need for targeted social interventions to promote breastfeeding rates in south korea. skin-to-skin contact (ssc), which involves placing naked babies on the mother’s bare chest to allow skin contact, has been recommended by the who for all newborns immediately after birth since 2003. 7 ssc increases breastfeeding rates effectively both in preterm and term infants. 7–10 in preterm infants admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit, ssc was associated with better developmental and cognitive outcomes. 11 12 however, there is a lack of research examining the long-term impact of ssc on neurobehavioural or cognitive outcomes in term infants. 13 south korea’s unique postpartum culture presents a significant barrier to the promotion of ssc and breastfeeding. 14 15 according to a korean government report, in 2024, 85.5% of postpartum women used postpartum care centres, and the mean duration spent in these centres was 12.6 days. in postpartum care centres, mothers have the option to either stay with their baby in the same room (rooming-in) or have the baby stay in a nursery for the duration of their stay. mothers used these centres for self-recovery (91.2%), acquisition of baby care skills (6.2%) and mother-infant intimacy or attachment (2.2%). 16 this observation was reflected in the low rate of rooming-in (3%) among postpartum women according to a 2018 report. 17 many mothers consider their stay at postpartum care centres as an opportunity to rest and recover without parenting responsibilities; hence, they do not desire to practise mother-infant attachment. 14 15 18 as a result, babies are separated from their mothers and cared for in nurseries. 18 this cultural practice possibly contributes to south korea’s low breastfeeding rates, given the reported link between rooming-in and exclusive breastfeeding. 19 during the 1980s and 1990s, many nordic and western countries eliminated or significantly reduced the use of nurseries. this shift emphasised family-centred care, prioritising minimal separation between infants and their mothers, and resulted in recommendations to phase out neonatal nurseries. this transition fostered the mother-infant bond and improved the infant’s clinical outcomes. 12 20 from this perspective, south korea’s postpartum culture is a regression, countering the times. despite the lowest birth rate in the world, south korea has the lowest breastfeeding rate, and neonatal care is contrary to global trends. this double-blind, parallel-group, randomised controlled trial (rct) aims to investigate the short-term and long-term effects of mother-infant ssc in healthy term infants and to offer evidence that supports prioritising mother-infant closeness and skin contact during the first few weeks in postpartum care centres in south korea. the primary goal of this study is to examine whether mother-infant ssc is more effective than standard care in increasing the breastfeeding rate in healthy term infants. the secondary goal includes the various effects of ssc implemented during the neonatal period on maternal postpartum depression, anxiety levels and mother-infant intimacy. we will also explore the long-term effects of ssc on growth, temperament and cognitive and behavioural development of infants. methods and analysis study design this is a prospective, double-blind, rct with two parallel groups (intervention and control). the ssc intervention will begin after discharge to home or a postpartum care centre and continues for 2 weeks. maternal and infant outcomes will be measured at 1, 4, 8, 12, 24 and 36 months of age. the expected total duration of the study from the start of recruitment to the last participant finishing the assessment is 5 years. outcome measures primary outcome. any breastfeeding (combined with formula and/or solid or not) at 4 months of infant age. secondary outcomes. any breastfeeding (combined with formula and/or solid or not) at 1, 8 and 12 months of infant age. maternal depression score measured using the korean-edinburgh postnatal depression scale at 3–6 days, 1 month and 4 months of infant age. 21 maternal anxiety level measured using the korean-state-trait anxiety inventory at 3–6 days, 1, 4, 8 and 12 months of infant age. 22 mother-infant intimacy was measured using the korean-maternal postnatal attachment scale at 1, 4, 8 and 12 months of infant age. 23 tertiary outcomes (long-term infant outcomes). infant growth of weight, height and head circumference until 36 months. the infants’ general developmental screening score was measured using the korean-developmental screening test at 4, 8, 12, 24 and 36 months. 24 infant autism spectrum screening results—measured using the korean modified checklist for autism in toddlers revised version at 24 and 36 months. 25 infant behaviour assessment results—using the korean-child behaviour checklist at 24 and 36 months. 26 infant temperament—using the korean-infant behaviour questionnaire-revised at 8 months and the korean-early childhood behaviour questionnaire-revised at 24 months. 27 infant motor, cognitive and social development—measured at 24 and 36 months using the korean-bayley scales of infant and toddler development third edition (k-bsid-iii) at 24 and 36 months. 28 infant language development—using the korean sequenced language scale for infants (k-selsi) at 24 and 36 months. 29 artificial intelligence (ai) analysis of infant movement videos obtained at 3–6 days, 1 month and 4 months. sample size calculation the sample size was calculated based on reports of a 25.9% breastfeeding rate in south korean infants at 4 months 6 and a study showing that ssc for 15–90 min increased the breastfeeding rates 2.6-fold. 30 using g*power v.3.1 (heinrich-heine-universität düsseldorf, düsseldorf, germany), with a power of 95% and significance level of 0.05, the calculated sample size for each group was 40 participants. assuming a dropout rate of 15%, a follow-up failure rate of 15% and a protocol non-compliance rate of 15%, 65 participants per group were required. the target sample size is 130 participants (65 mothers and their infants in each group). patient and public involvement prior to commencing the study design, we conducted focus group interviews with women in early postpartum periods, local residents with experience in using postpartum care centres and managers of postpartum care centres to develop a community-guided research strategy on ssc for healthy term infants. these inputs influenced the design and creation of a mobile diary app and the development of educational resources for the participants. the findings of this study will be publicly disseminated to community members and personnel at postpartum care centres in korea. participants and recruitment a total of 130 participant pairs will be recruited from eligible mothers and infants admitted to the nursery of korea university anam hospital within 72 hours after delivery by obtaining written informed consent. all eligible subjects will be screened to achieve the target number of participants. the inclusion and exclusion criteria are presented in table 1 . to reliably evaluate the effects of ssc in a typical postpartum care setting, we will include healthy mother-infant pairs. we will select mothers without acute postpartum complications and single pregnancies to reduce confounding factors. limiting participants to married mothers will ensure consistent psychosocial support, which may influence maternal outcomes. included infants will be term-born (≥37 weeks gestation), weigh ≥2500 g at birth and have apgar scores ≥7 at 5 min after birth. we will exclude patients who require intensive care to minimise medical confounders. these criteria will enable a rigorous assessment of the short-term and long-term effects of ssc within the context of south korean postpartum care. view this table: view inline view popup table 1 inclusion and exclusion criteria the baseline clinical data for the mother and newborn at the time of participant registration are as follows: maternal data including age, address, history of infertility treatment, medical history (chronic hypertension, diabetes), obstetric history, parity, gravidity, antenatal antibiotics (type and duration of antibiotics used), other medications, pre-eclampsia, gestational diabetes, rupture of membranes and duration, oligohydramnios, mode of delivery, alcohol consumption and smoking during pregnancy, highest level of education and occupation of the women and their partners, and plan for postpartum care centre admission. neonatal data, including date of birth, sex, gestational age, birth weight, height, head circumference, small-for-gestational-age or large-for-gestational-age, 1 min and 5 min apgar scores and birth order. randomisation and blinding participants will be randomised to either the intervention or control group after recruitment. randomisation will be carried out by an investigator from the department of preventive medicine who does not have direct contact with the mothers or their infants. a computer programme will be used to randomly assign participants to two groups using permuted blocks (4 and 6) stratified by first-born and subsequent-born infants, with a 1:1 random allocation. the assigned groups will be communicated to the researchers dedicated to parent education at the site. participants will be blinded to their assigned group, and the study will be described as an investigation of the infant’s sleep, feeding, bonding and overall health, so as not to influence mother-infant contact time. to minimise potential bias, all personnel responsible for scoring and evaluating the outcomes will also be blinded to group allocation, except for the researchers providing education to the control and intervention groups. to ensure proper allocation concealment, the randomisation sequence will remain concealed until the study is complete. intervention and control groups’ condition typically, postpartum mothers and healthy infants are discharged from the hospital 3–6 days after delivery. one dedicated investigator will deliver newborn care education and information on the mobile diary app to the enrolled mothers on the day of discharge, according to their study group. both the intervention and control groups will be educated on general information about infant sleep, breastfeeding and bathing. mothers in both groups will be requested to fill out the same mobile diary app daily for 2 weeks after discharge. the mobile diary app named “my baby diary” documents the following: feeding type and amount (breastfeeding or formula), frequency of diaper change (urine or stool), sleep time, crying time and holding time as clothed and ssc time. for the intervention group, additional instruction will be provided along with an informational pamphlet emphasising the importance and clinical advantages of mother-infant ssc, and participants will be given the opportunity to practise ssc according to established practice guidelines before discharge. they will be informed to engage in a minimum of 6 hours of ssc per day with the infant’s and mother’s chests exposed for at least 15 min per session and to keep a record of the contact time. timeline an overview of the timeline is presented in figure 1 and table 2 . view this

all study data will be recorded in electronic case-record forms (ecrfs). data corrections will be performed according to the instructions and timeline. the investigators will be trained in the study requirements, including capturing infant movement videos, counselling for adherence and the eliciting of information from study participants in a uniform, reproducible manner. the data to be collected and the procedures to be conducted will be reviewed in detail. each of the data collection forms and the nature of the required information will be discussed in detail on an item-by-item basis. entering data forms, responding to data discrepancy queries and general information about obtaining research-quality data will also be covered during the training session. data integrity will be enforced through referential data rules, range checks and consistency checks. checks will be applied at the time of data entry into a specific field and/or before the data is saved to the database. modifications to data written to the database will be documented through either the data change system or an inquiry system. data entered into the database will be retrievable for viewing through the data entry app. the type of activity that an individual user may undertake is regulated by the privileges associated with his/her user identification code and password. data errors will be detected by programmes designed to detect missing data or specific errors in the data. these errors will be summarised along with detailed descriptions for each specific problem in data query reports, which will be sent to the study investigators. and study staff who receive the inquiry will respond by checking the original forms for inconsistency, checking other sources to determine the correction, modifying the original form and entering a response to the query. the investigators will be asked to confirm the accuracy of the completed crfs by signing key crfs as indicated. the source documents will be securely stored on a local encrypted server to maintain confidentiality. the only study documents containing participants’ names are the enrolment and informed consent forms. hard copies of the data forms will remain locked when not being actively used. access to data files that include personal identification details will be restricted to the principal investigators and essential study personnel. all study-related documentation will be maintained for at least 3 years following the completion of the study. data analysis plan continuous values will be summarised as means with sd or medians with iqr. categorical variables will be summarised as the proportion of participants in each category. a primary comparative analysis of the two groups will be conducted according to the intention-to-treat principle. secondary as-treated analyses could be incorporated to enhance the robustness of the study findings. the patterns of missing data will be checked before analysis. all measurements will be controlled for outliers and checked for normality. differences between the two groups of categorical variables will be analysed using the χ 2 test or fisher’s exact test, whereas continuous variables will be assessed using an independent t-test or the mann-whitney u test. multivariate logistic regression analysis will be employed to compare the two groups. the level of significance for the study is 5% (two-sided) for all analyses. ai-powered analysis of infant movements ai algorithms will be developed to analyse infant’s whole body movements captured in videos. computer vision techniques will be used to track key joint movements and extract relevant kinematic features, including joint positions, velocities and movement patterns. machine learning models will then be trained to identify deviations from typical movement patterns. although the assessment captures motor characteristics similar to those evaluated by the general movements assessment, the automated approach provides enhanced precision and consistency compared with traditional expert-based observational methods. the system’s performance will be rigorously evaluated against longitudinal developmental outcome measures. this advanced predictive modeling aims not only to replicate but also to extend the predictive capabilities of existing standardised assessment tools for the early identification of infants at risk for neurodevelopmental impairments. study coordination and monitoring once the subject is enrolled and randomised, the study personnel will make every reasonable effort to follow the mother and infant for the entire study period. this will include regular contact through scheduled visits, phone calls and monitoring of adherence to the study protocol to ensure the completeness and accuracy of data collection. compliance will be monitored using data recorded by the mother in a mobile diary app during the study period, including the time spent on ssc and time spent on holding the clothed infant. participants will be provided with monetary incentives for their involvement. this will include a 50 000 krw transportation allowance for each visit and dessert coupons worth approximately 20 000 krw for completing mobile surveys. as part of the study, enrolled infants will receive complimentary developmental assessments, specifically two k-bsid-iii tests (valued at 100 000 krw each) and two k-selsi tests (valued at 50 000 krw each), performed by trained professionals. written feedback about the infant development assessment results will be given to all included mothers. participants can withdraw from the study for any reason at any time. the investigator may also withdraw participants from the study if they are unwilling or unable to comply with required study procedures after consultation with the study staff. this study will be monitored by the clinical trial centre of the korea university anam hospital, seoul, south korea. independent data and safety monitoring committee members, blinded to the intervention arms, will conduct monitoring every 6 months to assess participants’ safety and trial progress, including recruitment, dropout, follow-up failure and adherence to the protocol. ethics and dissemination this study was reviewed and approved by the institutional review board (irb) of korea university anam hospital (irb no.
