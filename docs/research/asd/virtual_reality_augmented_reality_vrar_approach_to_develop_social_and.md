## Abstract

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a complex neurodevelopmental disorder that affects a significant proportion of the world's population, particularly children and adolescents. The sensory processing issues can be an evidence-based target for therapeutic/corrective interventions by controlling the intensity and targeted replacement of maladaptive sensory stimuli with neutral stimuli using virtual reality or augmented reality. We searched for articles on Pubmed. The search query included ((VR or virtual reality) or (AR or augmented reality)) and (children or adolescents) and (ASD or autism spectrum disorder or autism). Our criteria were met by 25 articles. 19 articles used VR, 5 articles used AR and 1 article used MR. Most interventions offer children and adolescents with ASD individualized tasks. Immersive VR games developed collaborative skills. Other systems encourage and teach directed facial gaze. Evaluation of the effectiveness of learning in VR/AR environment is carried out by means of different scales, qualitative analysis of surveys, questionnaires and interviews, studying the number and duration of eye contacts between the participant and the avatar. It should be noted that almost all studies were conducted on small samples, so their results allow us to draw only preliminary conclusions about the effectiveness of VR /AR. The following key areas of VR/AR technologies for children and adolescents with high-functioning ASD can be identified: communicating with an avatar, including answering its questions, tracking the child's gaze and encouraging the child to look at the face, placing it in social situations close to real life, practicing common everyday situations, learning to recognize emotions. A VR/AR-based therapy approach may help children with autism spectrum disorder without cognitive impairment to develop higher levels of adaptation in terms of social and communication skills. However, more research is needed to evaluate the effectiveness of different methods.
