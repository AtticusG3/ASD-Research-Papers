## Abstract

Nursing care aims to promote health and well-being among patients, but if nurses are to meet this requirement, they need to know the needs of the individual. Among autistic patients, health and well-being may be promoted using factors other than those used among other groups, indicating that their care needs may also differ. The aim of the study was to investigate what autistic adults need if they are to experience health and well-being. The aim was also to evaluate how nurses can use this information in nursing care based on the Fundamentals of Care framework. This was a qualitative-theoretical descriptive study incorporating elements of netnography. Podcasts in which autistic individuals discuss their health and well-being were listened to and qualitatively analyzed to address the first part of the aim. The Fundamentals of Care framework was then used to demonstrate how results from the first part of the aim could be applied in nursing care to meet the care needs of autistic patients. The study reveals that when autistic adults speak freely about their life, they mention interests, pride, being a support to others, satisfying the body's needs, health-promoting places, being alone, experiencing straightforward communication, receiving support from others and having routines as important to their health and well-being. All of these aspects are relevant to consider when trying to meet autistic patients' nursing care needs. For example, minimizing sensory impressions and being able to have routines are important to physical well-being. The study reveals that adult autistic individuals may have partly different nursing care needs compared to most patients. Nurses can meet autistic patients' needs using the Fundamentals of Care framework, adapted to autistic individuals, as a guide. This study only involves public data and has not recruited any participants. However, the researcher has autism herself and is well-versed in the research field and the knowledge development desired by the international autistic community.
