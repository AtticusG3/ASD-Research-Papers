## Abstract

The paper aims to present the relationship between sensory processing disorder (SPD) and psychiatric disorders, the resulting practical implications, and possible future research directions. Previous research has shown a significant relationship between SPD and a wide range of disorders, from the autism spectrum to affective and anxiety disorders and schizophrenia. Assessing SPD according to Winnie Dunn's Four Quadrant Model, identifies 4 types of sensory processing: Low Registration, Sensation Seeking, Sensory Sensitivity, and Sensation Avoiding. The model allows analysis of the functioning of people with psychiatric disorders, highlighting the importance of diagnosis and sensory therapy as an important component of support in psychiatric treatment. Understanding these relationships is essential for developing more effective therapeutic strategies that take into account the specificity of sensory processing in people with psychiatric disorders. The article highlights the potential benefits of using sensory therapy as an adjunct to traditional treatments and also underscores the need for further research to better understand the complexity of the relationship between SPD and psychiatric disorders, which could help improve patients' quality of life.
