## Abstract

Differences in sensory processing are a core feature of autism spectrum disorder. Hyper- and hyporesponsivity to sensory stimuli have historically been conceptualized as separate constructs but may co-occur within individuals. Sensory processing may impact both lower and higher-level cognitive processes; thus, it is crucial to understand the relationships between hyper- and hyporesponsivity within and across modalities, as well as the relationship between sensory processing and other aspects of development in both autistic and typically developing (TD) children. In 3-4-year-old children ( We found a positive correlation between sensory hyper- and hyporesponsivity (œÅ = .788, The positive correlations between hyper- and hyporesponsivity both within and across sensory modalities, which we term the "Sensory Paradox," may provide key clues to understanding sensory processing in autism and other neurodevelopmental disorders by pointing towards neural circuit-level mechanisms that may underlie neurodevelopmental conditions.
