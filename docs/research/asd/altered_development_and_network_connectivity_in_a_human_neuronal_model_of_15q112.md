## Abstract

The chromosome 15q11.2 locus is deleted in 1.5% of patients with genetic epilepsy and confers a risk for intellectual disability and schizophrenia. Individuals with this deletion demonstrate increased cortical thickness, decreased cortical surface area and white matter abnormalities. Human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived neural progenitor cells from 15q11.2 deletion individuals exhibit early adhesion junction and migration abnormalities, but later neuronal development and function have not been fully assessed. Imaging studies indicating altered structure and network connectivity in the anterior brain regions and the cingulum suggest that in addition to alterations in neural progenitor dynamics, there may also be structural and functional changes within discrete networks of neurons. To explore this, we generated human forebrain cortical neurons from iPSCs derived from individuals with or without 15q11.2 deletion and used longitudinal imaging and multielectrode array analysis to evaluate neuronal development over time. 15q11.2 deleted neurons exhibited fewer connections and an increase in inhibitory neurons. Individual neurons had decreased neurite complexity and overall decreased neurite length. These structural changes were associated with a reduction in multiunit action potential generation, bursting and synchronization. The 15q11.2 deleted neurons also demonstrated specific functional deficits in glutamate- and GABA-mediated neuronal network activity and synchronization with a delay in the maturation of the inhibitory response to GABA. These data indicate that deletion of the 15q11.2 region is sufficient to impair the structural and functional maturation of cortical neuron networks, and suggest an in vitro correlate to the pathologic changes in humans with the 15q11.2 deletion.
