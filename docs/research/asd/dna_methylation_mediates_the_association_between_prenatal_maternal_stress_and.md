## Abstract

Prenatal maternal stress (PNMS) predicts risk for autism spectrum disorders (ASD), although the mechanisms are unknown. Because ASD and autistic-like traits have been associated with both prenatal stress and DNA methylation differences, it is important to examine whether epigenetic mechanisms mediate the pathway from PNMS to later autistic-like outcomes. This study aimed to determine the extent to which DNA methylation mediates the association between PNMS from a natural disaster and autistic-like traits in offspring assessed during adolescence. Five months following the 1998 ice storm in Quebec, we recruited women who had been pregnant during the crisis and assessed their PNMS: objective hardship, subjective distress, and cognitive appraisal. At age 13, their children provided blood samples for DNA. At ages 15, 16 and 19, the youth self-reported their own autistic-like traits using the Broad Autism Phenotype Questionnaire. This longitudinal design allowed us to track the developmental pathway from prenatal exposure, through adolescent DNA methylation, to later behavioral outcomes. Analyses included youth with data on PNMS, DNA methylation, and the BAPQ (
