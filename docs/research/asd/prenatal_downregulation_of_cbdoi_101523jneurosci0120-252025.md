## Abstract

Endocannabinoid signaling exerts a neurodevelopmental regulatory role via CB

endocannabinoid signaling exerts a neurodevelopmental regulatory role via cb 1 cannabinoid receptors (cb 1 rs), which control pyramidal neuron differentiation, migration, and axonal guidance. here, we investigated the long-lasting consequences of transient prenatal cb 1 r downregulation within the mouse prefrontal cortex by assessing its impact on gene expression, neuronal electrophysiological properties, and animal behavioral traits. transient loss of cb 1 rs as induced by in-utero small-interference rna electroporation at embryonic day 14.5, when upper-layer neurons are generated, arrested cell migration leading to ectopic neurons that populated deep layers. whole-cell current–clamp recordings showed that ectopic neurons are less excitable (increased afterhyperpolarization amplitude, decreased sag, lower firing frequency) than deep-layer–native pyramidal neurons. differentially expressed genes (degs), identified by microarray characterization of facs-sorted electroporated neurons, were significantly enriched in pathways related to cortical development, regulation of cell migration, neurotransmitter secretion, and cytoskeletal organization. gene set enrichment analysis also supported enrichment in pathways associated with neurodegenerative disorders and synaptic function. the gene expression profile of sicb 1 r-derived neurons showed degs that had been previously associated with intellectual disability, schizophrenia, and autism. venn diagrams unveiled one common deg for neuropsychiatric risk databases and cb 1 r expression manipulation, namely, the transcription factor zbtb20. prenatal knockdown of cb 1 rs induced long-lasting behavioral alterations in the adult offspring of either sex, with an impairment of social interaction and motor behavior in sicb 1 r-derived adult mice. taken together, these findings highlight the role of cb 1 rs in controlling the development of pyramidal neurons in the prefrontal cortex and support the contribution of altered endocannabinoid signaling to neuropsychiatric vulnerability. autism cannabinoid intellectual disability prefrontal cortex projection neuron zbtb20 sfn exclusive license . view full text member log in log in using your username and password username * enter your journal of neuroscience username. password * enter the password that accompanies your username. forgot your user name or password? purchase access you may purchase access to this article. this will require you to create an account if you don't already have one. back to top in this issue journal of neuroscience vol. 45 , issue 42 15 oct 2025 table of contents about the cover index by author masthead (pdf) email thank you for sharing this journal of neuroscience article. note: we request your email address only to inform the recipient that it was you who recommended this article, and that it is not junk mail. we do not retain these email addresses. your email * your name * send to * enter multiple addresses on separate lines or separate them with commas. you are going to email the following prenatal downregulation of cb1 cannabinoid receptors in the mouse prefrontal cortex disrupts cortical lamination and induces a transcriptional signature associated with social interaction deficits message subject (your name) has forwarded a page to you from journal of neuroscience message body (your name) thought you would be interested in this article in journal of neuroscience. your personal message captcha this question is for testing whether or not you are a human visitor and to prevent automated spam submissions. print view full page pdf citation tools prenatal downregulation of cb 1 cannabinoid receptors in the mouse prefrontal cortex disrupts cortical lamination and induces a transcriptional signature associated with social interaction deficits samuel simón-sánchez , femke den boon , daniel garcía-rincón , georgia skrempou , juan paraíso-luna , alfonso aguilera , marta nieto , taco r. werkman , manuel guzmán , pascal chameau , ismael galve-roperh journal of neuroscience 15 october 2025, 45 (42) e0120252025;
