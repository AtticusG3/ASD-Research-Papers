## Abstract

## Results

## Methods
revealed that children with asd showed reduced dwell time in a specific brain state and fewer state transitions compared to td children. these atypical brain state patterns were negatively correlated with autism symptom severity and positively correlated with adaptive behavior and cognitive performance across participants. mediation analysis revealed that adaptive behavior fully mediated the relationship between brain dynamics and cognitive performance. furthermore, dynamic connectivity features achieved 74.4% accuracy in distinguishing asd from td children. importantly, the link between brain dynamics and cognitive performance was replicated in an independent td sample, underscoring the robustness of this finding. together, these findings highlight altered brain dynamics in young children with asd and underscore the critical role of adaptive behavior in bridging neural activity and cognitive performance. these insights advance our understanding of neural mechanisms underlying asd and point to potential pathways for early interventions and clinical applications. significant statement the brain dynamics and their relationships with symptom severity and cognitive abilities in children with autism spectrum disorder (asd) remain poorly understood. using dynamic functional connectivity analysis, our study identified distinct brain state patterns in children with asd. these patterns were associated with both autism symptom severity and cognitive performance. importantly, adaptive behavior emerged as a crucial mediator between brain dynamics and cognitive function. our findings provide novel insights into the neural mechanisms of asd and highlight the critical role of adaptive behavior in formulating future intervention strategies. by linking specific neural dynamics to adaptive behaviors and cognitive abilities, our study enhances our understanding of asd neurobiology and has the potential to improve outcomes for affected children. footnotes footnotes the authors declare no conflict of interest. we are grateful to the parents and children who participated in our research;
