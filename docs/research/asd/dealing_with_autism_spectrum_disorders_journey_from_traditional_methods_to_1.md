## Abstract

World Health Organisation (WHO) in 2024 identified that approximately one in 100 children globally has autism spectrum disorder (ASD). ASD is a collection of neurodevelopmental disorders that impact a person's ability to socially interact and communicate, which can typically be noticed in early childhood. While 'autism' as a term was initially used for schizophrenic patients, later psychiatrists Dr. Kanner and paediatrician Dr. Asperger introduced it as a syndrome in children with behavioural differences in social interaction and communication with restrictive and repetitive interests. In today's time, the umbrella term 'ASDs' is used to describe a clinically heterogeneous group of neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs).
## Methods
The study adopts a narrative review approach to understand the application of AI in ASD. For this purpose, around a hundred research articles were selected from the years 2010-2024. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were identified. The review is organised and grounded on the medical treatment, occupational remedy, vocational remedy, psychology, family remedy and recuperation engineering.
