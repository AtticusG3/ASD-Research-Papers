## Abstract

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a complex group of severe neurodevelopmental disorders characterized by varying degrees of dysfunctional communication and social abilities as well as repetitive and compulsive stereotypic behaviors. We aim to evaluate the genetic predisposition to oxidative response and its relationship with altered oxidative stress markers in ASD patients. Genomic DNA was isolated from peripheral blood lymphocytes of 106 (83 M, 23 F; 7.9 ± 3.2 years) ASD patients and 90 healthy subjects (63 M, 27 F; 21.2 ± 1.8 years). Genotyping was performed by real-time PCR-based allelic discrimination, PCR and electrophoresis of GST deletion variants. Reactive oxygen metabolites (dROMs), the Biological Antioxidant Potential (BAP), and the advanced oxidation protein products (AOPP) were also measured. Furthermore, we assessed oxidative DNA damage by Single Cell Gel Electrophoresis. The evaluation of oxidative stress markers indicated a mild oxidative stress status and a higher level of DNA damage in nuclei of ASD patients' lymphocytes. We found significant associations between ASD and several polymorphisms of genes involved in the detoxification and the response to oxidative stress. Genetic and environmental factors contribute to the onset of autism spectrum disorder, and ASD patients' treatment requires a multimodal approach, including behavioral, educational, and pharmacological approaches.
