## Abstract

## Introduction

## Results

Results: The average age of children in the autism group was 7.5 ± 2.7 years, while in the typically developing (TD) children group, it was 7.7 ± 2.3 years (P = 0.656). A positive correlation coefficient was observed between the CARS questionnaire score, the SRS questionnaire score, the SCQ questionnaire score, and the ASDS ‏(P &lt; 0.01). In the SRS questionnaire, the area under the ROC curve was 0.976, and in the SCQ questionnaire it was 0.953, both of which had a good and significant diagnostic value (P &lt; 0.001). A sensitivity of 0.942 and specificity of 0.811 for the cut-off point of 62.5 were obtained in the SRS questionnaire. Additionally, a sensitivity of 0.865 and specificity of 0.925 for the cut-off point of 15.5 were achieved in the SCQ questionnaire.
