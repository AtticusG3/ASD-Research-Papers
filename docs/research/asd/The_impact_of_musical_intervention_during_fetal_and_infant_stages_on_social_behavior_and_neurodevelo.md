## Abstract

The potential benefits of music in prenatal and early childhood education are widely acknowledged, yet the neurobiological mechanisms underlying its effects on social behavior, particularly during early development, remain underexplored. This study investigated the impact of musical intervention on social behavior and neurodevelopment in mice, focusing on mechanisms at various developmental stages. Pregnant mice were exposed to music starting at embryonic day 13 (E13) and continuing until postnatal weeks 1, 3, or 5. Behavioral tests, including three-chamber social task and social interaction assays, revealed that musical exposure significantly enhanced social interaction in adult mice. mRNA sequencing revealed notable changes in the expression of genes associated with social behavior in both the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and the amygdala. Additionally, Golgi staining demonstrated increased dendritic complexity, spine density, and dendritic length in these regions following music exposure. Elevated MAP2 expression was observed in the mPFC and amygdala, whereas GFAP expression was reduced in the amygdala. These findings provide valuable insights into the neurobiological mechanisms by which music affects early development and underscore its potential as a noninvasive tool to promote social and emotional well-being. This research has implications for therapeutic interventions in individuals with neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism spectrum disorder (ASD).
