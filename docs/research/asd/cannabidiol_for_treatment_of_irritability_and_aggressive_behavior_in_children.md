## Abstract

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder commonly associated with behavioral challenges. There are few evidence based pharmacological interventions available for the treatment of behavioral symptoms associated with ASD. Cannabidiol (CBD), the non-intoxicating component of cannabis, has known neuroprotective, antiepileptic, anxiolytic, and antipsychotic effects and may be useful in treating the behavioral symptoms of ASD. We describe the research methods of a 27-week randomized placebo-controlled crossover trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of oral CBD for the treatment of irritability and aggression associated with ASD, as measured by the irritability subscale of the aberrant behavior checklist-2 There is significant need for clinical research exploring alternative medications for the treatment of behavioral symptoms of ASD. Upcoming results from this trial will help answer the question of whether CBD may be a useful intervention in the management of ASD. NCT04520685.
