## Abstract

In this article, we present the case of an adult patient, whose main problem is episodes of fantasizing and rocking lasting up to 12 hours a day and completely preventing school development. The nature of the disorder in the patient is related to the sinking into fantasies, and not typical obsessions as in OCD. The patient was previously treated with drugs from the SSRI group, neuroleptics (without aripiprazole) and methylphenidate. Only methylphenidate showed some improvement; however, it made the patient feel â€Ÿstiff in thinking". The patient was hospitalized because of a suicide attempt, which, as it later turned out, was self-harm with no intention of killing himself. During hospitalization, a differential diagnosis was performed and the diagnosis of Asperger's syndrome was made, which was accompanied by immersion in the world of one's fantasies and stereotypical behavior. The patient was administered aripiprazole at a dose of 15 mg/d and after three weeks, a significant improvement in health was achieved, including a reduction in the duration of episodes from several hours to several dozen seconds. The drug is well tolerated by the patient. The patient was discharged from the hospital and continues his school education. In the article, we present single case reports in which similar spectacular results were achieved in similar cases. We also describe a possible physiological explanation for this response to this drug.
