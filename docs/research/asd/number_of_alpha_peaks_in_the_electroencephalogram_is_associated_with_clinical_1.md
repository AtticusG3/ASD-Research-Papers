## Abstract

EEG alpha-band neural activity has been previously reported to be altered in Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), but no studies have been done addressing different parameters of alpha-band activity, their relation to clinical phenotype and copy number variation (CNV) in ASD.
The study included 310 youth with and without ASD and consisted of resting-state EEG, behavioral phenotyping, and genome-wide CNV analysis.
The results revealed, first, that alpha peak power was reduced in ASD, and younger age autistic males had a higher number of peaks compared to younger age autistic females. Second, higher number of alpha peaks was related to lower language skills and higher presence of autistic traits. Finally, higher number of alpha peaks was related to higher number of CNVs.
The study explored a novel measure (number of peaks) associated with both clinical phenotype and genetic burden and supports alterations in alpha-band activity in ASD.
