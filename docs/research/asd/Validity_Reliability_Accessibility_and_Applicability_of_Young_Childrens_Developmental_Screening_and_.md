## Abstract

Valid and reliable developmental screening and assessment tools allow professionals to identify disabilities/delays in children, enabling timely intervention to limit adverse lifelong impacts on health. However, differences in child development related to culture, genetics, and perinatal outcomes may impact tool applicability. This study evaluated the validity, reliability, and accessibility of multidomain developmental screening tools for young children, analyzed the applicability of tools across different contexts, and created a compendium of tools. Employing adapted realist review methods, we searched APA PsycInfo, MEDLINE, CINAHL, ERIC, and Google to identify relevant articles and information. We assessed accessibility, validity, reliability, and contextual applicability (N = 4110 evidence sources) to create tool ratings and make recommendations. Of 33 identified tools, 22 were screening and 11 were assessment tools. Fewer screening tools than assessment tools were rated highly overall. Evidence for use in different cultures was often lacking for both types of tools. The ASQ (screening) and BDI (assessment) tools were rated most favorably and are recommended for use, though other tools may be more applicable in different contexts (e.g., NEPSY among children with Asperger's Syndrome). Future research should focus on assessing the validity and reliability of tools across different demographics to increase accessibility and ensure all children are properly supported.
