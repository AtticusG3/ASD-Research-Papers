background methyl cpg binding protein 2 (mecp2) is an essential global modulator of transcription and mutations in mecp2 are the most common cause of rett syndrome, an x-linked neurodevelopmental disorder. patients diagnosed with rett syndrome have increased risk for epilepsy as well as problems with anxiety and social communication. using the zebrafish mecp2 q63x line, this study aimed to increase our understanding of the role of mecp2 function in regulation of pharmacologically-induced hyperlocomotion, developmental social preference, and adult socialization, anxiety-related behaviour, and baseline cortisol levels. to determine responses of mecp2 −/− zebrafish to a stimulating convulsant, general locomotor activity was measured at 5 days post-fertilization (dpf) in sibling mecp2 +/+ , mecp2 +/− , and mecp2 −/− fish after treatment with a gaba a receptor antagonist pentylenetetrazol (ptz) at varying concentrations. responses to social stimulus were investigated in juvenile (21 dpf) and adult mecp2 −/− and mecp2 +/+ fish. anxiety responses to a novel tank and whole-body cortisol levels were also measured in adult mecp2 −/− and control mecp2 +/+ zebrafish. results the behavioural tests showed that mecp2 −/− zebrafish displayed hypolocomotion at the larval stage, along with increased freezing time and thigmotaxis, and higher whole-body cortisol levels in adulthood. however, the hyper-locomotion response to ptz at 5 dpf and social preference for visual social stimulus at 21 dpf and in adulthood were not affected by the lack of functional mecp2. conclusions functional mecp2 modulated larval locomotion and behavioural anxiety at different ages and adult cortisol levels, but mecp2 null-mutation did not alter adult locomotion and socialization, and developmental sociability and ptz-induced hyperlocomotion in zebrafish. given the variability reported in patients and in rodent mecp2 knockout models, studies using zebrafish can explore vital elements of mecp2’s role across development and improve our understanding of neural mechanisms underlying neurodevelopmental disorders. peer review reports introduction mecp2 (methyl cpg binding protein 2) is essential for maturation and optimal functioning of neurons and non-neuronal cells as a global transcription regulator [ 1 , 2 ]. under- and overexpression of mecp2 is linked to rett syndrome, mecp2 duplication syndrome, and various other neuropathologies and developmental disorders [ 3 – 5 ]. the x-linked mecp2 gene is ubiquitously expressed, and the mecp2 protein binds to methylated cpg dinucleotides and other non-cpg motifs [ 1 ], and modulates activity-dependent neuronal transcription of genes [ 2 ] in the vicinity of the methylated sequence. upon synaptic activity, mecp2 gets phosphorylated which controls its repressor activity through recruitment of histone deacetylase and the corepressor sin3a, and in turn regulates experience-dependent dendritic growth and spine maturation in the brain [ 6 – 8 ]. over 600 mutations in the mecp2 gene have been identified as the major cause [ 5 ] of the progressive neurodevelopmental disorder rett syndrome [ 3 , 4 ]. in humans, rett syndrome is a monogenic disorder that primarily affects girls as the males fetuses do not tend to survive [ 9 ]. following seemingly typical prenatal and infant development, rett syndrome has an early onset [~ 6–12 months of age] and a characteristic disease pattern of rapid and progressive developmental delay, regression, and loss of motor and language skills [between 12–30 months] along with gait impairments and repetitive hand stereotypies [ 10 , 11 ]. this regression is followed by a longer plateau stage with stable abilities and symptoms for several years and can be followed by a later deterioration stage [5–25 years of age] with further reduction in motor skills [ 10 – 12 ]. although the first disease-modifying treatment trofinetide, a synthetic analog of glycine–proline–glutamate, the n-terminal tripeptide of the insulin-like growth factor 1 protein [igf1], was approved by the fda recently [ 13 , 14 ], treatment of rett syndrome have been mainly symptomatic [ 15 ]. the typical symptoms of this syndrome are lack of intentional hand movements, intellectual disability, language difficulties, repetitive movements, autonomic dysfunction, poor eye contact, and social behavioural problems [ 16 – 18 ]. additionally, seizures, heart problems, gastrointestinal and sleep abnormalities, heightened anxiety and stress responses [ 19 , 20 ], and aberration in stress hormone, cortisol [ 21 – 23 ], have been reported in these patients. while abrupt changes in mood, irritability, and heightened anxiety are not clinically diagnostic for rett syndrome, recent natural history and care-giving studies have identified these to be significant concerns by care-givers and commonly treated using anxiolytics and anti-depressants [ 10 – 12 , 19 , 20 , 24 ]. therefore, there is a great need for model systems for evaluating pharmaceutical, biologic, and gene therapies that may relieve and ameliorate symptoms of rett syndrome, including motor, social, mood, and anxiety symptoms. animal models that mimic the phenotype of rett syndrome have been generated by knocking out mecp2 in mice [ 25 – 30 ], rats [ 31 , 32 ], and primates [ 33 ]. in addition, disease models using human neurons derived from stem cells (ipscs) from patients with rett syndrome offer the potential of high-throughput drug screening [ 34 – 38 ] while patient-derived, gene-edited, and knock-out cortical organoid models can also allow better recapitulation of variability and complexity seen in rett syndrome [ 39 – 42 ]. extensive animal studies mainly in mice reveal that loss of mecp2 expression results in cognitive impairments [ 43 , 44 ], abnormal gait and reduced locomotor activity [ 45 ], increase vulnerability to stress and premature death [ 2 , 46 , 47 ], and alters specific aspects of synaptic physiology and neurotransmission that may impact the balance of excitation/inhibition [e/i balance] in the brain [ 48 – 50 ] but specific signalling pathways underlining behavioural and neuronal abnormalities phenocopied in mutant mice remain unknown. additionally, similar to many other neuropathologies, promising treatments from various mice studies focusing on mecp2 show no or limited translational effectiveness. the lack of phenotypic complexity in in-vitro cell and coculture models and the variance, subtlety, and mildness in phenotypes [ 51 , 52 ] of onset, progression, and lethality reported in hemizygous male and heterozygous female mouse models necessitate additional model systems with sufficient phenotypic complexity and practical simplicity. the zebrafish offers a complementing model with several advantages over mammalian and cell/culture model systems as an excellent tool with availability of sophisticated genetic manipulation techniques, high-throughput screening approaches [ 53 , 54 ], and detailed investigations of behaviours, such as locomotion and sociability [ 55 – 60 ], and anxiety [ 45 , 61 , 62 ]. zebrafish mecp2 shows similarity [ 63 ] in amino acid sequence [43%] and expression patterns in adult brains and across development, and the mecp2 gene is autosomal [chromosome 8 and not x-chromosome] [ 64 ]. null mecp2 −/− zebrafish are viable and fertile allowing both sexes to be studied, along with feasibility of studying potential epigenetic and transgenerational effects. to study neurodevelopmental roles and to identify previously unknown functions and novel mechanisms of mecp2, unique features of the zebrafish can be particularly important such as producing large numbers of externally fertilized transparent embryos that can be tracked experimentally into juvenile and adult stages. the small size, rapid external development, and robust locomotor, anxiety, and feeding behaviours exhibited by larval zebrafish within a few days post-fertilization (dpf) could be greatly revealing in studying the earliest effects of mecp2-deficiency that eventually leads to pathology. additionally, while juvenile and adult zebrafish show a wide range of complex social, affective, and cognitive behaviours, the adult zebrafish brain retains higher level of neurogenesis mimicking mammalian embryonic brain [ 65 ]. zebrafish are also diurnal, rely on their vision more than olfaction for social perception and processing, and have metabolic, physiological, and epigenetic mechanisms that more closely mirror human circadian oscillation. such advantages may be leveraged to provide greater understanding of variation in phenotypes seen in affected patients, differentiate between conflicting results seen in mouse models, and, shed more light on disparities reported between patients and mouse and other mammalian models. previous work with zebrafish mecp2 -null mutants have showed recapitulation of milder phenotypes of human rett syndrome symptoms. studies of zebrafish mecp2 including development of key mutant and morpholino-mediated models, environmental factors and pleiotropic interactions, and relevant upstream regulators of mecp2 and affected downstream pathways are summarized in the timeline in table 1 . aside from confirmation of motor impairments and changes in anxiety behaviour in the enu-derived and tilling-selected mecp2 -null zebrafish mecp2 q63x model [ 64 ], visual function and energy metabolism have also been suggested to be impaired [ 66 , 67 ]. in the current paper, to identify current progress, common themes, and any gaps and to gain a more comprehensive understanding of existing literature, particularly the mecp2 q63x model, we first briefly reviewed all published zebrafish mecp2 studies (table 1 ). to further substantiate the use of mecp2 −/− zebrafish as a model for rett syndrome and to investigate basic visual function, we measured general locomotion and anxiety-related behaviours at three different ages [5 dpf, 21 dpf, and 6-months of age], ptz-induced hyperlocomotion in larval 5 dpf fish, social preference for vision-based social stimuli when zebrafish start shoaling [21 dpf] and social, anxiety, and locomotion behaviour and cortisol levels in adulthood in mecp2 −/− zebrafish. table 1 chronological history of key developments and significant discoveries of zebrafish mecp2 structure, expression, and function full size table materials and methods zebrafish husbandry zebrafish ( danio rerio ) were bred and housed at the university of gothenburg. breeding adults (parents of test fish), experimental fish, and additional stock ab fish used as social stimuli were housed in an automated recirculation system (aquaneering, san diego, usa), supplied by deionized water, and supplemented with pro reef salt (tropic marin, wartenberg, germany) and nahco 3 to maintain conductivity at 700–800 μs and ph between 7.2—7.4. adults and larvae were held in the same room under a 14:10 h light–dark cycle (light on between 8 am and 10 pm) and at temperature of 27–28 °c. starting from 6 days post-fertilization (dpf), fish were moved from the incubator to the system and fed three times per day with age-appropriate granulated fry food (zm-100, zm-200, zm-300, zm systems, winchester, uk) and brine shrimp nauplii ( artemia salina , zm fish foods, winchester, uk) from 10 dpf. adult fish were fed brine shrimp nauplii once a day and granular pellets (zm fish food, winchester, uk) twice a day. zebrafish were held at a density of approximately 30 embryos per petri dish during 0—5 dpf, 10 fish per litre during larval period [6—21 dpf], and 3–5 fish per litre as juveniles and adults. larval experimental work took place at 5 dpf or at 21 dpf, and all larvae were experimentally naïve. adult behavioural testing and cortisol sampling was done at 6-months of age. sample sizes were based on existing zebrafish behavioural studies of appropriate ages and our previous work [ 57 , 64 , 91 ]. a total of 672 experimental 5 dpf fish were used, 140 experimental fish (and 40 ab fish as social stimuli) were used for social preference testing at 21 dpf. also, 66 experimental fish (with 20 ab fish as social stimuli) were employed for adult behavioural tasks and 12 fish were used for cortisol analysis. adult experimental and stimuli fish and 21 dpf stimuli fish were re-used for other purposes (brood stock, social stimuli, other pilot work, etc.). an overview of the experimental protocol and example behavioural tracks are illustrated in fig. 1 . fig. 1 schematic representation of the experimental protocol at 5 days post-fertilization (dpf), 21 dpf, and 6-months old adult fish. experiments done at the three ages are separated and denoted with purple outline. blue arrows show timeline of procedures while orange dotted lines represent virtual division of testing arenas into relevant areas. for 5 dpf larval fish ( a ), general locomotion was observed during a baseline period, followed by ptz-induced hyperlocomotion. representative examples of behavioural traces are provided to illustrate typical locomotion (wells a1 and b2), immobility (well b1), and hyperlocomotion (well a2). for 21 dpf fish ( b ), three traces illustrate preference (top), indifference (middle), and aversion (bottom) to social stimuli. the dotted orange lines mark the social and non-social zone used for calculation of social preference index [spi]. for adult fish, the dotted orange lines indicate the line between border and center during ( c ) baseline open field testing, five zones during social preference testing ( d ) with zone 1 being closest to the shoal [social zone] and zone 5 being the furthest away from the shoal during social behavioural testing, and the division of water column into vertical top, middle and bottom areas ( e ) during novel tank diving test. representative traces below show bottom-dwelling vs. exploration in higher water column in the open-field, no preference vs. social preference during the social behaviour test, and exploration of bottom only, middle, and top areas of the novel tank. after the behavioural testing, all fish were ( f ) fin-clipped under anaesthesia for genotyping. separate group of experimentally naïve adult fish were used to measure whole-body cortisol levels ( g ) using enzyme immunoassay full size image ethical considerations experiments adhered strictly to a study protocol approved by the local animal ethics committee in gothenburg and followed the animal use and care guidelines of the swedish national board for laboratory animals (ethical permit # 5.8.18–08496/2018) and european directive 2010/63/eu. experiments were planned as per prepare guidelines (norecopa: norway's national consensus platform for the advancement of "the 3 rs") and data are reported here according to the arrive guidelines from the national centre for the replacement, refinement & reduction of animals in research of uk. mecp2 −/− zebrafish line maintenance and genotyping the previously described mecp2 −/− zebrafish line carrying mecp2 q63x mutation in a nacre background was used [ 64 ] as well as mecp2 +/+ siblings from the same parents. prior to this experimental work, this line had been appropriately outcrossed to ensure removal of any potential unintended mutations typically associated with enu-mutagenesis [ 64 ]. larvae from both heterozygous and homozygous crosses were used in experiments. heterozygous parents [ mecp2 +/− paired with mecp2 +/− ] generated offspring with all three genotypes while homozygous pairs ( mecp2 +/+ males bred with mecp2 +/+ females; mecp2 −/− males with mecp2 −/− females) generated only homozygous offspring genotypes. homozygous mecp2 -null parents [ mecp2 −/− x mecp2 −/− ] were used for in-crosses specifically to check for any confounding influence of maternally deposited wildtype mecp2 transcripts or mecp2 protein from heterozygous parents. age-matched wildtype ab zebrafish were raised to be used as stimuli animals for the social experiments. after the behavioural testing was performed as described below, all experimental 5 dpf and 21 dpf larvae were euthanized and adult fish were anesthetized and fin-clipped using age-appropriate ms-222 concentrations. larval fish and fin samples were sent to lgc service lab, uk for genotyping by kompetitive allele-specific pcr (kasp) for all experiments (except for the cortisol experiments, genotyping pcr for those were done in-house, as described before [ 64 ]. pentylenetetrazole (ptz) preparation and exposure, and locomotion assay for 5 dpf fish larval zebrafish of 5 dpf were used to examine if the mecp2 q63x fish showed a different locomotor response after treatment with ptz, compared to controls. the larvae were placed in 48-well plates with 1.6 ml of system water in each well. their behaviour was then recorded for 30 min to serve as a baseline, using a video camera (sony handycam hdr-cx405) mounted above the well plate. ptz stock solution (200 mm) was prepared on the same day as experimental testing was performed by dissolving ptz (sigma-aldrich) in milli-q water. the stock solution was diluted into the system water to get additional ptz-stocks and 0.5 ml of appropriate solutions were mixed with system water of the wells to get desired final concentrations [0, 1, 2.5, 5, 7.5, and 10 mm]. the final concentrations used were well-established and based on prior zebrafish studies that showed hyperlocomotion and induction of seizures (stage i and ii) in larval zebrafish [ 92 ]. following addition of ptz, behaviour during ptz exposure was recorded 30 min. immediately after the experiments, the animals were euthanized in 300 mg/l ms-222 solution, placed in individual pcr tubes on dry ice, and stored at −80 degrees until sent for kasp genotyping (see above). recorded videos of baseline and ptz-treated behaviour were analyzed offline using automated tracking functions of ethovision (noldus information technology, wageningen, netherlands) software. larval social behaviour assay for 21 dpf fish larval zebrafish of 21 dpf were used to investigate if young mecp2 q63x fish displayed different social preferences compared to controls, at the time-point when social behaviour first becomes observable. the social preference of mecp2 +/+ , mecp2 +/− and mecp2 −/− zebrafish larvae was examined by placing them individually in a u-shaped test arena (3.5 × 4.5 cm) with a transparent glass bottom, as previously described [ 57 , 91 ], placed on top of a light table and filmed from above using a video camera (sony handycam hdr-cx405). the test arenas had at each end a squared stimulus chamber which was separated from the test chamber by a wall of transparent glass. the stimulation chambers could be visually shielded from the test chamber by blinders made of opaque white plastic [ 57 , 91 ]. the experiment started when the experimental fish were placed in the test chamber, visually shielded by blinders from the social stimulus, which consisted of one ab fish of the same age. in each experiment 16–18 test fish were run in parallel, in test chambers that were visually separated [i.e., test fish could not see other test fish, stimuli, or the experimenters]. fish were recorded for 20 min during baseline open-exploration, and for 20 min after the opaque blinders were removed and social stimulus was visibly available. recorded videos of behaviour during baseline and social-stimulus conditions were analyzed offline using ethovision (noldus) automated tracking. a social preference index (spi) was calculated; the time spent in the non-social zone was subtracted from the time spent in the social zone and the result was divided by the total time [ 57 , 91 ]. fish (n = 3) that remained frozen for more than 50% of the time or did not enter both social and non-social zones during the baseline period were excluded from the analysis. open field test for adult fish the open field behaviour was observed in the baseline period of the first 10 min of the 6-months old adult social behaviour assay (described below) as adult mecp2 + / + and mecp2 −/− swim freely. the experimental set-up was comprised of one large test tank (60 cm × 30 cm), and two smaller side tanks (15 cm × 30 cm) that were positioned at the short ends of the test tank [ 91 ]. the water depth was 10 cm in both the test tank and in each of the side tanks. tank water was made daily from deionized water and salts (meersalt from tropic marin) and was ph and salinity adjusted to match the conditions of the home-tanks. the set-up was filmed from above using a video camera. experimental tanks were visually isolated from surroundings and the experimenters using black non-transparent plastic sheets; additionally with opaque blinders ensuring that the test tank was visually isolated from the side tanks containing social stimuli fish during the baseline period [10 min]. to measure thigmotaxis behaviour from the recorded movies, a periphery zone was defined as a 5 cm distance from sides of the tank, leaving a 50 × 20 cm center zone in the middle of the chamber. fish were tested individually, and the time spent in the defined periphery and center zones, along with total distances swam during the 10 min were quantified and compared between genotypes. recorded videos were analyzed offline using topscan behaviour analysis system (cleversys inc., reston, virginia, usa) software. social behaviour assay for adult fish adult zebrafish were used to examine if mecp2 −/− fish exhibited atypical social response compared to control mecp2 + / + fish in adulthood. the stimulus shoal consisting of four age-matched ab fish was placed in one of the two side tanks whilst the second tank remained empty, and the shoal side was counterbalanced during trials. for the data analysis in topscan behaviour analysis system, the bottom of the test tank was virtually divided into five equally sized horizontal zones. the zone closest to the shoal was zone one [social zone] with zone five being the furthest away from the shoal. the focal fish was first exposed to the social behaviour test (25 min duration, i.e., 10 min baseline period and 15 min with social stimuli), then it was gently netted to the novel tank diving set up. novel tank diving test for adult fish a subset of adult zebrafish was used to investigate if mecp2 −/− fish exhibited anxiety-like behaviour in response to a new environment compared to controls. the novel tank diving paradigm used one 1.5 l trapezoidal test tank, measuring 15 cm height × 27 cm top × 23.5 cm bottom × 6 cm width. tank water ph and salinity was adjusted to match the conditions of the home-tanks. the experiment was recorded by a side-view camera for 20 min, using the program debut video capture software. recorded videos were analysed offline using topscan analysis system. during analysis, the test tank was virtually divided into 3 vertical zones, to denote top, middle, and bottom areas of the tank. at the end of the experimental day, a fin clip was taken from each fish during anesthesia with 164 mg/l ms-222 for genotyping. post-clipping fish were kept individually in separate tanks for 24 h before returning to their home tank, and then used as brood stock once fins were healed. cortisol sampling and extraction in adult fish whole-body cortisol levels were measured from mixed-sex and equally-sized zebrafish that were experimentally naïve and left undisturbed prior to sampling. cortisol was extracted in three independent experiments from six adult mecp2 −/− and six control mecp2 +/+ zebrafish as described previously [ 93 ].cortisol was extracted in three independent experiments from six adult mecp2 −/− and six control mecp2 +/+ zebrafish as described previously [ 93 ]. briefly, each body sample was collected, weighed, and then dissected on ice into sections for homogenization. each sample was mixed with 5.0 ml of diethyl ether, vortexed for 1 min, and centrifuged at 3500 rpm for 5 min. once the ether was evaporated, the lipid cortisol residue was reconstituted in 1.0 ml of pbs. the extract was assayed for cortisol following manufacturer’s guidelines for high-sensitivity salivary cortisol enzyme immunoassay kit (salimetrics, pa, usa < catalogue no. 1–3002). samples, standards, and controls were run in triplicates and reaction intensity was measured using a plate reader. cortisol calculations (ng/g) were standardized to body weight and buffer volume for individual fish. statistics and data analysis larval and juvenile behaviour videos were tracked using offline automated functions in ethovision xt version 14 (noldus) software while the adult behaviour videos were tracked using topscan (cleversys) offline automated tracking. statistical analyses were performed using ibm spss statistics version 25 and group differences were considered significant when p < 0.05. generally, after considering normality and homogeneity of variances, hypothesis testing on multiple group experimental design experiments was done using linear models (anovas or wilcoxon/kruskal–wallis tests) followed by suitable post-hoc contrasts if appropriate. data were analyzed for main effects of genotype and ptz-concentration [between-subject factors] and time [before and after ptz-treatment or social stimulus as within-subject factor] as appropriate. two-way anovas were used for evaluation of effects of genotype and breeding [homozygous vs heterozygous parents], followed by tukey’s multiple comparisons tests. repeated measure anovas were used for comparisons of mean values from multiple groups or time points. unpaired or nested t-tests were used for comparisons of mean values from two genotype groups, as appropriate. if a main effect or interaction was found, post-hoc tests (t-tests, one-way anovas, or dunn's multiple comparisons test) were carried out for direction of effect, as applicable. as sex cannot be determined in larval fish at 5 dpf and 21 dpf, we examined only adult data for any potential sex differences, and when no sex-effects existed, male and female data were pooled together for analysis. to test null-hypotheses regarding differences between mecp2 +/+ and mecp2 −/− fish, we acknowledge well-established and reproducible main effects of time/habituation and ptz concentrations briefly and focused primarily on reporting only main effects of genotype and all significant interactions involving genotype. results five dpf mecp2 −/− fish displayed hypolocomotion, but no difference in ptz-induced hyperlocomotion locomotion of 5 dpf larvae was tested in two sets of fish, offspring from homozygous parents ( mecp2 +/+ males bred with mecp2 +/+ females; mecp2 −/− males with mecp2 −/− females; resulting in only two homozygous genotypes) and from heterozygous parents ( mecp2 +/− x mecp2 +/− ; resulting in all three genotypes). homozygous in-crosses control for any confounding effects of maternally deposited wildtype mecp2 transcripts but has a drawback of comparing non-siblings. conversely, siblings from heterozygous crosses provide control for any clutch/family differences but all embryos acquire maternally deposited mecp2 [ 63 ]. when testing 5 dpf larvae from homozygous breeding, we found mecp2 −/− fish moved significantly less (fig. 2 a; t = 6.142, df = 318, p < 0.0001) than mecp2 +/+ fish, and although five gradually higher concentrations of ptz (0, 1, 2.5, 5, 7.5, 10 mm) increased locomotion in a dose-dependent way (p < 0.05, for main effect of ptz), there were no differences between mecp2 +/+ and mecp2 −/− fish in ptz-induced hyperlocomotion (fig. 2 b; p > 0.05, for all ptz concentrations). likewise, the mecp2 −/− fish from heterozygous parents also moved shorter distances (fig. 2 c; t = 2.448, df = 156, p = 0.016) before ptz-treatment compared to their mecp2 + / + siblings, and these fish were comparable to fish from homozygous crosses. while ptz (control and two concentrations: 0, 5, and 10 mm) increased locomotion (fig. 2 d; p < 0.05, for main effect of ptz) in all 5 dpf sibling larvae from heterozygous parents, there were no main effects of genotype on ptz-induced hyperlocomotion (fig. 2 d; p < 0.05). statistically significant differences in movement within genotypes between baseline and ptz-treatment are presented in table 2 . overall, these results show that mecp2 −/− zebrafish at 5 dpf, from both homozygous and heterozygous crosses, displayed hypolocomotion at baseline but reacted similarly to ptz treatment as compared to the control groups. fig. 2 larval locomotion behaviour was similarly affected in mecp2 −/− fish bred from homozygous parents (top panel) and heterozygous parents (bottom panel). a baseline locomotion prior to ptz-treatment for 5 dpf larvae from homozygous breeding showed that mecp2 −/− (n = 117) larvae moved significantly shorter distances than mecp2 + / + (n = 203). b distances moved by mecp2 + / + (blue; n = 33–35) and mecp2 −/− (red; n = 19–20) fish from homozygous parents were similar during baseline (20 min before; lighter colours) and showed similar increases during ptz-treatment (20 min, darker colours). c baseline locomotion prior to ptz-treatment for 5 dpf larvae from heterozygous mecp2 +/− crosses showed that mecp2 −/− (n = 68) larvae moved significantly shorter distances than mecp2 + / + (n = 90). d the distances moved were similar during baseline (20 min before; lighter colours) and the hyperlocomotion during ptz-treatment (20 min, darker colours) was also similar in 5 dpf mecp2 + / + , mecp2 +/− , and mecp2 + / + fish derived from heterozygous breeding. sample sizes were mecp2 + / + (blue; n = 41–65), mecp2 +/− (purple; n = 86–90) and mecp2 −/− (red; n = 35–37). significant effects of ptz-treatment within genotypes are indicated in grey. ****p < 0.0001 and *p < 0.05. mean values shown as dotted lines and brackets mark sem (a and c) and bars correspond to mean ± sem (b and d) full size image table 2 within genotype comparisons for movement during baseline and ptz treatment periods for various concentration full size table mecp2 −/− zebrafish larvae do not display altered social preference at 21 dpf to determine any effects of mecp2 null-mutation on social preference and locomotion in three-week old fish, mecp2 −/− and mecp2 +/− zebrafish were compared to wildtype mecp2 + / + siblings from heterozygous breeding during baseline and social phases. the spi distributions for social phase were not normal and non-parametric tests were used for determining the effect of genotype and visual social access. as illustrated in fig. 3 a, kruskal–wallis tests showed no main effect of genotype during baseline (p = 0.702) and social (0.922) phases. wilcoxon signed rank test revealed that heterozygous mecp2 +/− fish (p < 0.001) showed significantly stronger bias for the zone adjacent to social stimulus (p = 0.140 for mecp2 +/+ ; p = 0.0816 for mecp2 −/− ). fig. 3 social preference

= 37) larvae compared to mecp2 + / + (n = 23) zebrafish. additionally, sibling zebrafish of all three genotypes spent similar length of time in the social zone ( b ) and swam similar distances ( c ) during the baseline and stimulus phases of the experiment. ****p < 0.0001 ***p < 0.001 **p < 0.01 and *p < 0.05. mean ± sem full size image we also compared time spent in social zone separately as well and all three groups displayed stronger bias towards social zone in the social phase of the test. no main effect of genotype was detected (fig. 3 b; p > 0.05 for both baseline and social phase; kruskal–wallis test) and significantly more time was spent in the adjacent social zone during visual social access by for mecp2 +/+ , mecp2 +/− , and mecp2 −/− (fig. 3 b; p = 0.009, p < 0.0001, and p < 0.0001, respectively; wilcoxon signed ranks tests). lastly, we analyzed total distances moved during baseline and social phases of the social preference test and a repeated-measures anova showed a significant decrease in overall movement during visual access to social stimulus (fig. 3 c; f (1,132) = 24.735, p < 0.001) but no main effect or interaction of genotype on distances moved. overall, zebrafish at 21 dpf displayed similar levels of locomotion and social preference regardless of their mecp2 genotype. anxiety behaviours in adult mecp2 −/− fish were affected but not open-field locomotion to get a better understanding of movement and anxiety-related behaviours in adult mecp2 −/− fish, responses of 6-months old adult mecp2 −/− and mecp2 + / + fish individually placed in a large open-field were observed. both genotype groups displayed similar locomotion and there was no main effect of genotype on total distances moved (fig. 4 a; p > 0.05; t-test). for analysis of thigmotaxis (wall-hugging) behaviour in adult mecp2 −/− fish, we also examined time spent in center vs. periphery of the testing tank. there was a main effect of genotype (fig. 4 b; t = 2.026, df = 64, p = 0.047) confirming that overall mecp2 −/− fish spent less time in the center zone during undisturbed observation. as indicated in fig. 4 c, all fish spent progressively more time in the center during the baseline, with male mecp2 −/− fish showed less thigmotaxis compared to female mecp2 −/− fish, and repeated-measures anova showed a time x sex x genotype interaction (f (9, 558) = 3.418, p = 0.0004) and a significant effect of time (f (9, 558) = 20.98, p < 0.0001), but there were no main effects of genotype or sex for time spent in periphery. thus, adult zebrafish displayed similar levels of locomotion regardless of their mecp2 genotype whereas the mecp2 −/− fish displayed less time in the center zone indicating increased anxiety-like response compared to controls. fig. 4 anxiety-related behaviours and whole-body cortisol levels were altered in adult mecp2 −/− fish while locomotion and social preference were unaffected. locomotion in the open-field ( a ) was not affected but adult mecp2 −/− fish spend significantly less time in the ( b ) centre zone in the open field compared to the mecp2 + / + group and ( c ) male mecp2 −/− fish showed somewhat less time in the periphery, compared to female mecp2 −/− fish. during the presentation of social stimuli, time spent in the social zone ( d ) was not significantly different in adult mecp2 −/− (n = 43) as compared to mecp2 + / + (n = 22). while mecp2 −/− fish generally trended towards more time closer to social stimuli than mecp2 + / + fish across the 15 min ( e ) the spi was not different between the two groups of fish (f ). in a novel tank diving task, the mecp2 −/− (n = 22) zebrafish made less bottom-to-middle transitions ( g ) and spent less time in high-mobility state ( h ) and more time in the immobile state (i) as compared to mecp2 +/+ (n = 10) indicating an increase in bottom-dwelling and freezing behaviours, but overall time spent in bottom, middle, and top areas ( j ) was not different between the two genotypes. baseline cortisol levels ( k ) were higher in experimentally naïve mecp2 −/− (n = 6) fish compared to mecp2 + / + (n = 6) zebrafish. *p < 0.05 and ****p < 0.0001. mean ± sem full size image mecp2 −/− zebrafish do not display altered social preference in adulthood both genotypes responded to social stimuli and spent similar length of time in the social zone when exposed to the conspecific shoals. we compared total time spent in social zone, time across the 15 min of social stimuli availability, and spi, and found no differences between adult mecp2 −/− and mecp2 + / + (fig. 4 d, e, f; p > 0.05; t-tests). overall, parallel to three-week-old zebrafish, adult fish also displayed similar levels of social preference regardless of their mecp2 genotype. adult mecp2 −/− zebrafish display increased anxiety behaviour in a novel tank in the novel tank diving paradigm, we found a reduction in the number of bottom-to-middle transitions made by the mecp2 −/− fish (fig. 4 g; t = 2.080, df = 30, p = 0.0461). we also found that the duration of time in high mobility state was significantly reduced (fig. 4 h; t = 2.502, df = 30, p = 0.0181) and time being immobile was significantly increased (fig. 4 i; t = 2.093, df = 30, p = 0.0449) in the mecp2 −/− group compared to the mecp2 +/+ fish, even while time spent in bottom, middle, and top sections of the novel tank did not differ between the genotypes (fig. 4 j; t = 0.0014, df = 4, p = 0.994; nested t-test). taken together, these results indicate that adult mecp2 −/− zebrafish displayed elevated levels of anxiety behaviours, such as bottom-dwelling and freezing. adult mecp2 −/− zebrafish have higher cortisol levels lacking functional mecp2 affected resting whole-body cortisol levels in experimentally naïve unstressed fish. compared to mecp2 +/+ fish, similarly sized mecp2 −/− fish had higher cortisol levels (fig. 4 k; t = 6.512, df = 10, p < 0.0001) in their bodies. thus, cortisol levels were elevated in adult mecp2 −/− zebrafish compared to controls. discussion in the current study of the zebrafish mecp2 gene, we replicated the previous finding that mecp2 q63x zebrafish larvae exhibit hypolocomotion compared to mecp2 + / + fish [ 64 ]. our results also revealed that the gaba a receptor antagonist ptz induced hyperlocomotion similarly in mecp2 −/− , mecp2 +/− , and mecp2 + / + siblings. to our knowledge, this is the first analysis of social and anxiety behaviour and cortisol levels of adult mecp2 q63x zebrafish. we found that mecp2 −/− zebrafish moved less and displayed higher anxiety behaviours and higher cortisol levels compared to mecp2 + / + fish. interestingly, our results also revealed that mecp2 −/− fish showed similar social preference as mecp2 + / + , both during ontogeny of social behaviour at 21 dpf larvae and as mature form of adulthood socialization. recently, several zebrafish mutant lines lacking genes linked to neurodevelopmental disorders have shown phenotypic seizure-like behaviour [ 92 , 94 – 97 ], social dysfunction [ 86 , 98 , 99 ] and locomotion abnormalities as well as changes in activity and morphology of relevant brain regions [ 96 , 100 ]. previously, zebrafish mecp2 gene manipulation studies have showed recapitulation of milder rett syndrome phenotypes in mutants and morphants, such as motor abnormalities and changes in larval anxiety behaviour [ 64 ] and transcriptomic and proteomic analyses have suggested impaired visual function and energy metabolism in mecp2 q63x fish [ 66 , 67 ]. exposure to genotoxic and environmental regulators such as morphine [ 77 ], alcohol [ 69 ], chronic bpa [ 74 ], crude oil and lead [ 75 ] have also been shown to regulate mecp2 expression and mecp2 function in zebrafish. altogether, these studies have further increased value of zebrafish models of rett syndrome and provided additional impetus to characterize motor, social, stress, and anxiety-like behaviour in developmental and adult mecp2 q63x fish. locomotion profile of mecp2 q63x fish similar to the current study, previously loss-of-function of mecp2 has been reported to cause hypolocomotion in 5–6 dpf larval zebrafish [ 64 ]. furthermore, morpholino-mediated knockdown of mecp2 led to a decrease in motor activity as early as 28 hpf in zebrafish morphants [ 78 ]. the hypolocomotion phenotype in larval zebrafish was suggested to be caused by an increase in abnormal axonal branches of caudal primary motor neurons [ 78 ] whereas selective activation of cholinergic neurotransmission reversed the locomotor impairment in mice [ 101 ]. while we did not find any differences in locomotion of adult mecp2 −/− and mecp2 + / + fish in the open-field, higher levels of freezing and bottom-dwelling were seen in the novel tank test of adult mecp2 −/− fish. here it is relevant to note that using the same null-mutation model and proteomics, impairments in energy metabolism, redox balance, and structure and function of cardiac and skeletal muscle in larval and adult fish have been suggested [ 66 ]. while our tests induced some anxiety for short durations, evaluation of mecp2 −/− fish in longer and more exhaustive motor tasks requiring more energy expenditure and higher muscle performance would shed light on behavioural consequences of altered proteomes. stress and anxiety-related behaviours in mecp2 q63x fish the elevated anxiety behaviour and higher cortisol levels observed in the mecp2 q63x zebrafish are of interest as these mimic frequently displayed heightened anxiety and mood fluctuation symptoms [ 10 , 11 , 19 , 23 , 24 ] and related aberrant hpa-axis function in rett syndrome patients, including increased cortisol levels [ 19 , 21 – 23 ]. also, mouse mecp2 has been reported to regulate stress vulnerability [ 46 ] and key genes in the hpa axis [ 47 , 102 , 103 ], and mice with truncated mecp2 allele have increased expression of corticotropin-releasing hormone and elevated levels of corticosterone in response to stress [ 104 ]. we purposely tested baseline cortisol levels in experimentally naïve fish as novel environments and handling during behavioural procedures can induce stress and led to changes in whole-body cortisol. while circulating levels of cortisol and corticosterone oscillate with circadian clock of the body and do not have a one-to-one relationship with psychological stress [ 105 ], higher resting cortisol levels observed in the mecp2 q63x mutant fish provide evidence of altered stress function linked to mecp2 null-mutation. future mecp2 q63x zebrafish studies with comparison of cortisol levels in resting and induced acute and chronic stress conditions, along with pharmacological treatments with anxiolytics and antidepressants would be valuable in further clarification of links between mecp2 deficiency and aberrant hpa-axis function in rett syndrome patients. in line with our results, mecp2 knockout mice have been reported to display increased anxiety-like behaviours [ 101 , 104 , 106 ], whereas stearns et al. [ 107 ] found decreased anxiety-like behaviour in mutant mecp2 mice and samaco et al. [ 47 ] showed that overexpression of mecp2 also increases anxiety-related behaviours in mice. thus, investigations of anxiety-related behaviours in animal models of rett syndrome have so far yielded some inconsistent findings across as well as within species, but the association with increased stress vulnerability and atypical stress responsiveness are fairly established. also, whereas we here show elevated anxiety when comparing adult mecp2 -/- zebrafish with mecp2 +/+ fish of the same age, a previous study doing the same comparison of 6 dpf zebrafish, carrying the same null-mutation, instead showed decreased anxiety [assessed using thigmotaxis or wall-hugging] [ 64 ]. these results, along with the locomotion findings, demonstrate distinct effects of mecp2 deletion in young and adult zebrafish, indicating that mecp2 may regulate behaviours differently during early development and adulthood. vision-based social behaviour in mecp2 q63x fish in contrast to patients with rett syndrome and mammalian models lacking functional mecp2, our investigations did not reveal any substantial role of mecp2 in the expression of social preference behaviour of 21 dpf mecp2 −/− larvae and adult mecp2 −/− fish. adult mecp2 knockout mice display a hypersocial phenotype in several studies whereas juvenile play behaviour was reduced in female rats [ 32 ]. aside from heightened anxiety mentioned above, the lack of differences in our social phenotype could also be a consequence of using behavioural tests that did not provide enough motivation or complexity of social interaction (for example, we used only one fish as social stimulus vs empty space for pfd 15 and visual-only access to a group of four conspecifics for adult fish). more stimulating social testing conditions may potentially disclose functional regulation of social behaviour by mecp2 in zebrafish, such as larger shoals, isolation-induced social behaviour, interactive shoaling with live conspecifics fish where test fish would swim in a group, or social buffering during stress, etc., and higher complexity of social interaction (such as social memory or recognition, and dyadic interactions seen during aggression or mating). nonetheless, the responses to vision-based social stimuli and novel environments in our study further suggest either no effects of lacking mecp2 on vision or compensation by additional factors in older 21 dpf and adult fish observed. future studies examining vision directly using higher-resolution observations and comprehensive investigations of shoaling, mating, and dyadic aggression dynamics in zebrafish mecp2 q63x fish will help elucidate these interactions. limitations a large number of patients with rett syndrome have intellectual disability and seizures. an obvious limitation of the current study is lack of cognitive evaluation of mecp2 q63x fish and future zebrafish studies using this model and other mecp2 manipulations should assess cognitive abilities in combination with social, motor and anxiety-like behaviours. our results indicated that pharmacological inhibition of gaba receptors induced a hyperlocomotion response similarly in all fish independently of the presence of the mecp2 protein. in contrast, mecp2 knockout mice display cortical discharges consistent with absence epilepsy [ 108 ] and loss of mecp2 specifically from forebrain excitatory neurons leads to cortical hyperexcitation and seizures [ 109 ], leading to suggestion of alterations of the balance between the excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission. thus, despite our finding, to fully exclude that mecp2 exert action on gaba signalling, and to explore any effects on glutamatergic functioning, future zebrafish studies should include alternative convulsants and electrophysiological recordings across development. considering the apparent and devastating deficits seen in humans carrying deficient mecp2, the lack of phenotypical differences in sociability and ptz-induced hyperlocomotion between mecp2 −/− and mecp2 + / + zebrafish are noticeable. our methodology does not allow distinction between seizure stages and thus well-established hypolocomotion in mecp2 −/− fish could mask ptz-induced changes. more comprehensive studies with electrophysiology and higher resolution observations are needed to confirm if the hypolocomotion is concealing the seizure-like activity or if the typical locomotion in ptz-treated mecp2 −/− larvae could be due to other factors (motivation, energy, etc.). taking in consideration the variability of symptoms seen in patients with rett syndrome, we cannot rule out the possibility that behavioural variations may exist at specific or later stages of zebrafish development—as seen in other animal models of the syndrome [ 110 ]. lastly, a caveat of using zebrafish models is that unlike humans, the zebrafish mecp2 gene is not on x-chromosome and sex determination in zebrafish is not influenced by sex chromosomes, but rather autosomal chromosomes and environmental factors play important roles. thus, while viable and fertile mecp2 −/− fish of both sexes can be studied, translation value of conclusions from zebrafish studies alone may be limited. conclusion dysfunction of mecp2, a protein vital for neuronal maturation and silencing of genes during growth and experience-dependent changes, is linked to rett syndrome, autism and other neurodevelopmental disorders. using a zebrafish model, we studied behaviour of young and adult zebrafish that lacked this protein and discovered that these fish mimic milder human symptoms of atypical movement and elevated anxiety, but overall vision and social behaviour were unaffected. in conclusion, the current study showed that zebrafish mecp2 modulates locomotion and anxiety but not sociability or ptz-induced hyperlocomotion. while this is the first study to explore adult behaviour in mecp2 −/− zebrafish, we have essentially raised more questions than answered. consequently, there is an urgent necessity to complement the existing enu-derived and tilling-selected line used in our experiments and create targeted mutant zebrafish models with greater precision. conditional mutants that reduce or eradicate mecp2 function at specific developmental timepoints or in specific brain areas and neuron-types during notable experiences (such as socialization or when exposed to stressful stimuli) can further help elucidate how experience-dependent neuronal changes are regulated by zebrafish mecp2. zebrafish research has grown exponentially with advancements in gene editing techniques, such as crispr-mediated base- and prime-editing, rna-editing, and combining brain-specific manipulation of mecp2 with high-throughput studies can make understanding of mecp2 function and potential therapeutic developments more feasible. availability of data and materials the datasets generated during and/or analysed during the current study and any

mecp2 (methyl cpg binding protein 2) is essential for maturation and optimal functioning of neurons and non-neuronal cells as a global transcription regulator [ 1 , 2 ]. under- and overexpression of mecp2 is linked to rett syndrome, mecp2 duplication syndrome, and various other neuropathologies and developmental disorders [ 3 – 5 ]. the x-linked mecp2 gene is ubiquitously expressed, and the mecp2 protein binds to methylated cpg dinucleotides and other non-cpg motifs [ 1 ], and modulates activity-dependent neuronal transcription of genes [ 2 ] in the vicinity of the methylated sequence. upon synaptic activity, mecp2 gets phosphorylated which controls its repressor activity through recruitment of histone deacetylase and the corepressor sin3a, and in turn regulates experience-dependent dendritic growth and spine maturation in the brain [ 6 – 8 ]. over 600 mutations in the mecp2 gene have been identified as the major cause [ 5 ] of the progressive neurodevelopmental disorder rett syndrome [ 3 , 4 ]. in humans, rett syndrome is a monogenic disorder that primarily affects girls as the males fetuses do not tend to survive [ 9 ]. following seemingly typical prenatal and infant development, rett syndrome has an early onset [~ 6–12 months of age] and a characteristic disease pattern of rapid and progressive developmental delay, regression, and loss of motor and language skills [between 12–30 months] along with gait impairments and repetitive hand stereotypies [ 10 , 11 ]. this regression is followed by a longer plateau stage with stable abilities and symptoms for several years and can be followed by a later deterioration stage [5–25 years of age] with further reduction in motor skills [ 10 – 12 ]. although the first disease-modifying treatment trofinetide, a synthetic analog of glycine–proline–glutamate, the n-terminal tripeptide of the insulin-like growth factor 1 protein [igf1], was approved by the fda recently [ 13 , 14 ], treatment of rett syndrome have been mainly symptomatic [ 15 ]. the typical symptoms of this syndrome are lack of intentional hand movements, intellectual disability, language difficulties, repetitive movements, autonomic dysfunction, poor eye contact, and social behavioural problems [ 16 – 18 ]. additionally, seizures, heart problems, gastrointestinal and sleep abnormalities, heightened anxiety and stress responses [ 19 , 20 ], and aberration in stress hormone, cortisol [ 21 – 23 ], have been reported in these patients. while abrupt changes in mood, irritability, and heightened anxiety are not clinically diagnostic for rett syndrome, recent natural history and care-giving studies have identified these to be significant concerns by care-givers and commonly treated using anxiolytics and anti-depressants [ 10 – 12 , 19 , 20 , 24 ]. therefore, there is a great need for model systems for evaluating pharmaceutical, biologic, and gene therapies that may relieve and ameliorate symptoms of rett syndrome, including motor, social, mood, and anxiety symptoms. animal models that mimic the phenotype of rett syndrome have been generated by knocking out mecp2 in mice [ 25 – 30 ], rats [ 31 , 32 ], and primates [ 33 ]. in addition, disease models using human neurons derived from stem cells (ipscs) from patients with rett syndrome offer the potential of high-throughput drug screening [ 34 – 38 ] while patient-derived, gene-edited, and knock-out cortical organoid models can also allow better recapitulation of variability and complexity seen in rett syndrome [ 39 – 42 ]. extensive animal studies mainly in mice reveal that loss of mecp2 expression results in cognitive impairments [ 43 , 44 ], abnormal gait and reduced locomotor activity [ 45 ], increase vulnerability to stress and premature death [ 2 , 46 , 47 ], and alters specific aspects of synaptic physiology and neurotransmission that may impact the balance of excitation/inhibition [e/i balance] in the brain [ 48 – 50 ] but specific signalling pathways underlining behavioural and neuronal abnormalities phenocopied in mutant mice remain unknown. additionally, similar to many other neuropathologies, promising treatments from various mice studies focusing on mecp2 show no or limited translational effectiveness. the lack of phenotypic complexity in in-vitro cell and coculture models and the variance, subtlety, and mildness in phenotypes [ 51 , 52 ] of onset, progression, and lethality reported in hemizygous male and heterozygous female mouse models necessitate additional model systems with sufficient phenotypic complexity and practical simplicity. the zebrafish offers a complementing model with several advantages over mammalian and cell/culture model systems as an excellent tool with availability of sophisticated genetic manipulation techniques, high-throughput screening approaches [ 53 , 54 ], and detailed investigations of behaviours, such as locomotion and sociability [ 55 – 60 ], and anxiety [ 45 , 61 , 62 ]. zebrafish mecp2 shows similarity [ 63 ] in amino acid sequence [43%] and expression patterns in adult brains and across development, and the mecp2 gene is autosomal [chromosome 8 and not x-chromosome] [ 64 ]. null mecp2 −/− zebrafish are viable and fertile allowing both sexes to be studied, along with feasibility of studying potential epigenetic and transgenerational effects. to study neurodevelopmental roles and to identify previously unknown functions and novel mechanisms of mecp2, unique features of the zebrafish can be particularly important such as producing large numbers of externally fertilized transparent embryos that can be tracked experimentally into juvenile and adult stages. the small size, rapid external development, and robust locomotor, anxiety, and feeding behaviours exhibited by larval zebrafish within a few days post-fertilization (dpf) could be greatly revealing in studying the earliest effects of mecp2-deficiency that eventually leads to pathology. additionally, while juvenile and adult zebrafish show a wide range of complex social, affective, and cognitive behaviours, the adult zebrafish brain retains higher level of neurogenesis mimicking mammalian embryonic brain [ 65 ]. zebrafish are also diurnal, rely on their vision more than olfaction for social perception and processing, and have metabolic, physiological, and epigenetic mechanisms that more closely mirror human circadian oscillation. such advantages may be leveraged to provide greater understanding of variation in phenotypes seen in affected patients, differentiate between conflicting results seen in mouse models, and, shed more light on disparities reported between patients and mouse and other mammalian models. previous work with zebrafish mecp2 -null mutants have showed recapitulation of milder phenotypes of human rett syndrome symptoms. studies of zebrafish mecp2 including development of key mutant and morpholino-mediated models, environmental factors and pleiotropic interactions, and relevant upstream regulators of mecp2 and affected downstream pathways are summarized in the timeline in table 1 . aside from confirmation of motor impairments and changes in anxiety behaviour in the enu-derived and tilling-selected mecp2 -null zebrafish mecp2 q63x model [ 64 ], visual function and energy metabolism have also been suggested to be impaired [ 66 , 67 ]. in the current paper, to identify current progress, common themes, and any gaps and to gain a more comprehensive understanding of existing literature, particularly the mecp2 q63x model, we first briefly reviewed all published zebrafish mecp2 studies (table 1 ). to further substantiate the use of mecp2 −/− zebrafish as a model for rett syndrome and to investigate basic visual function, we measured general locomotion and anxiety-related behaviours at three different ages [5 dpf, 21 dpf, and 6-months of age], ptz-induced hyperlocomotion in larval 5 dpf fish, social preference for vision-based social stimuli when zebrafish start shoaling [21 dpf] and social, anxiety, and locomotion behaviour and cortisol levels in adulthood in mecp2 −/− zebrafish. table 1 chronological history of key developments and significant discoveries of zebrafish mecp2 structure, expression, and function full size table materials and methods zebrafish husbandry zebrafish ( danio rerio ) were bred and housed at the university of gothenburg. breeding adults (parents of test fish), experimental fish, and additional stock ab fish used as social stimuli were housed in an automated recirculation system (aquaneering, san diego, usa), supplied by deionized water, and supplemented with pro reef salt (tropic marin, wartenberg, germany) and nahco 3 to maintain conductivity at 700–800 μs and ph between 7.2—7.4. adults and larvae were held in the same room under a 14:10 h light–dark cycle (light on between 8 am and 10 pm) and at temperature of 27–28 °c. starting from 6 days post-fertilization (dpf), fish were moved from the incubator to the system and fed three times per day with age-appropriate granulated fry food (zm-100, zm-200, zm-300, zm systems, winchester, uk) and brine shrimp nauplii ( artemia salina , zm fish foods, winchester, uk) from 10 dpf. adult fish were fed brine shrimp nauplii once a day and granular pellets (zm fish food, winchester, uk) twice a day. zebrafish were held at a density of approximately 30 embryos per petri dish during 0—5 dpf, 10 fish per litre during larval period [6—21 dpf], and 3–5 fish per litre as juveniles and adults. larval experimental work took place at 5 dpf or at 21 dpf, and all larvae were experimentally naïve. adult behavioural testing and cortisol sampling was done at 6-months of age. sample sizes were based on existing zebrafish behavioural studies of appropriate ages and our previous work [ 57 , 64 , 91 ]. a total of 672 experimental 5 dpf fish were used, 140 experimental fish (and 40 ab fish as social stimuli) were used for social preference testing at 21 dpf. also, 66 experimental fish (with 20 ab fish as social stimuli) were employed for adult behavioural tasks and 12 fish were used for cortisol analysis. adult experimental and stimuli fish and 21 dpf stimuli fish were re-used for other purposes (brood stock, social stimuli, other pilot work, etc.). an overview of the experimental protocol and example behavioural tracks are illustrated in fig. 1 . fig. 1 schematic representation of the experimental protocol at 5 days post-fertilization (dpf), 21 dpf, and 6-months old adult fish. experiments done at the three ages are separated and denoted with purple outline. blue arrows show timeline of procedures while orange dotted lines represent virtual division of testing arenas into relevant areas. for 5 dpf larval fish ( a ), general locomotion was observed during a baseline period, followed by ptz-induced hyperlocomotion. representative examples of behavioural traces are provided to illustrate typical locomotion (wells a1 and b2), immobility (well b1), and hyperlocomotion (well a2). for 21 dpf fish ( b ), three traces illustrate preference (top), indifference (middle), and aversion (bottom) to social stimuli. the dotted orange lines mark the social and non-social zone used for calculation of social preference index [spi]. for adult fish, the dotted orange lines indicate the line between border and center during ( c ) baseline open field testing, five zones during social preference testing ( d ) with zone 1 being closest to the shoal [social zone] and zone 5 being the furthest away from the shoal during social behavioural testing, and the division of water column into vertical top, middle and bottom areas ( e ) during novel tank diving test. representative traces below show bottom-dwelling vs. exploration in higher water column in the open-field, no preference vs. social preference during the social behaviour test, and exploration of bottom only, middle, and top areas of the novel tank. after the behavioural testing, all fish were ( f ) fin-clipped under anaesthesia for genotyping. separate group of experimentally naïve adult fish were used to measure whole-body cortisol levels ( g ) using enzyme immunoassay full size image ethical considerations experiments adhered strictly to a study protocol approved by the local animal ethics committee in gothenburg and followed the animal use and care guidelines of the swedish national board for laboratory animals (ethical permit # 5.8.18–08496/2018) and european directive 2010/63/eu. experiments were planned as per prepare guidelines (norecopa: norway's national consensus platform for the advancement of "the 3 rs") and data are reported here according to the arrive guidelines from the national centre for the replacement, refinement & reduction of animals in research of uk. mecp2 −/− zebrafish line maintenance and genotyping the previously described mecp2 −/− zebrafish line carrying mecp2 q63x mutation in a nacre background was used [ 64 ] as well as mecp2 +/+ siblings from the same parents. prior to this experimental work, this line had been appropriately outcrossed to ensure removal of any potential unintended mutations typically associated with enu-mutagenesis [ 64 ]. larvae from both heterozygous and homozygous crosses were used in experiments. heterozygous parents [ mecp2 +/− paired with mecp2 +/− ] generated offspring with all three genotypes while homozygous pairs ( mecp2 +/+ males bred with mecp2 +/+ females; mecp2 −/− males with mecp2 −/− females) generated only homozygous offspring genotypes. homozygous mecp2 -null parents [ mecp2 −/− x mecp2 −/− ] were used for in-crosses specifically to check for any confounding influence of maternally deposited wildtype mecp2 transcripts or mecp2 protein from heterozygous parents. age-matched wildtype ab zebrafish were raised to be used as stimuli animals for the social experiments. after the behavioural testing was performed as described below, all experimental 5 dpf and 21 dpf larvae were euthanized and adult fish were anesthetized and fin-clipped using age-appropriate ms-222 concentrations. larval fish and fin samples were sent to lgc service lab, uk for genotyping by kompetitive allele-specific pcr (kasp) for all experiments (except for the cortisol experiments, genotyping pcr for those were done in-house, as described before [ 64 ]. pentylenetetrazole (ptz) preparation and exposure, and locomotion assay for 5 dpf fish larval zebrafish of 5 dpf were used to examine if the mecp2 q63x fish showed a different locomotor response after treatment with ptz, compared to controls. the larvae were placed in 48-well plates with 1.6 ml of system water in each well. their behaviour was then recorded for 30 min to serve as a baseline, using a video camera (sony handycam hdr-cx405) mounted above the well plate. ptz stock solution (200 mm) was prepared on the same day as experimental testing was performed by dissolving ptz (sigma-aldrich) in milli-q water. the stock solution was diluted into the system water to get additional ptz-stocks and 0.5 ml of appropriate solutions were mixed with system water of the wells to get desired final concentrations [0, 1, 2.5, 5, 7.5, and 10 mm]. the final concentrations used were well-established and based on prior zebrafish studies that showed hyperlocomotion and induction of seizures (stage i and ii) in larval zebrafish [ 92 ]. following addition of ptz, behaviour during ptz exposure was recorded 30 min. immediately after the experiments, the animals were euthanized in 300 mg/l ms-222 solution, placed in individual pcr tubes on dry ice, and stored at −80 degrees until sent for kasp genotyping (see above). recorded videos of baseline and ptz-treated behaviour were analyzed offline using automated tracking functions of ethovision (noldus information technology, wageningen, netherlands) software. larval social behaviour assay for 21 dpf fish larval zebrafish of 21 dpf were used to investigate if young mecp2 q63x fish displayed different social preferences compared to controls, at the time-point when social behaviour first becomes observable. the social preference of mecp2 +/+ , mecp2 +/− and mecp2 −/− zebrafish larvae was examined by placing them individually in a u-shaped test arena (3.5 × 4.5 cm) with a transparent glass bottom, as previously described [ 57 , 91 ], placed on top of a light table and filmed from above using a video camera (sony handycam hdr-cx405). the test arenas had at each end a squared stimulus chamber which was separated from the test chamber by a wall of transparent glass. the stimulation chambers could be visually shielded from the test chamber by blinders made of opaque white plastic [ 57 , 91 ]. the experiment started when the experimental fish were placed in the test chamber, visually shielded by blinders from the social stimulus, which consisted of one ab fish of the same age. in each experiment 16–18 test fish were run in parallel, in test chambers that were visually separated [i.e., test fish could not see other test fish, stimuli, or the experimenters]. fish were recorded for 20 min during baseline open-exploration, and for 20 min after the opaque blinders were removed and social stimulus was visibly available. recorded videos of behaviour during baseline and social-stimulus conditions were analyzed offline using ethovision (noldus) automated tracking. a social preference index (spi) was calculated; the time spent in the non-social zone was subtracted from the time spent in the social zone and the result was divided by the total time [ 57 , 91 ]. fish (n = 3) that remained frozen for more than 50% of the time or did not enter both social and non-social zones during the baseline period were excluded from the analysis. open field test for adult fish the open field behaviour was observed in the baseline period of the first 10 min of the 6-months old adult social behaviour assay (described below) as adult mecp2 + / + and mecp2 −/− swim freely. the experimental set-up was comprised of one large test tank (60 cm × 30 cm), and two smaller side tanks (15 cm × 30 cm) that were positioned at the short ends of the test tank [ 91 ]. the water depth was 10 cm in both the test tank and in each of the side tanks. tank water was made daily from deionized water and salts (meersalt from tropic marin) and was ph and salinity adjusted to match the conditions of the home-tanks. the set-up was filmed from above using a video camera. experimental tanks were visually isolated from surroundings and the experimenters using black non-transparent plastic sheets; additionally with opaque blinders ensuring that the test tank was visually isolated from the side tanks containing social stimuli fish during the baseline period [10 min]. to measure thigmotaxis behaviour from the recorded movies, a periphery zone was defined as a 5 cm distance from sides of the tank, leaving a 50 × 20 cm center zone in the middle of the chamber. fish were tested individually, and the time spent in the defined periphery and center zones, along with total distances swam during the 10 min were quantified and compared between genotypes. recorded videos were analyzed offline using topscan behaviour analysis system (cleversys inc., reston, virginia, usa) software. social behaviour assay for adult fish adult zebrafish were used to examine if mecp2 −/− fish exhibited atypical social response compared to control mecp2 + / + fish in adulthood. the stimulus shoal consisting of four age-matched ab fish was placed in one of the two side tanks whilst the second tank remained empty, and the shoal side was counterbalanced during trials. for the data analysis in topscan behaviour analysis system, the bottom of the test tank was virtually divided into five equally sized horizontal zones. the zone closest to the shoal was zone one [social zone] with zone five being the furthest away from the shoal. the focal fish was first exposed to the social behaviour test (25 min duration, i.e., 10 min baseline period and 15 min with social stimuli), then it was gently netted to the novel tank diving set up. novel tank diving test for adult fish a subset of adult zebrafish was used to investigate if mecp2 −/− fish exhibited anxiety-like behaviour in response to a new environment compared to controls. the novel tank diving paradigm used one 1.5 l trapezoidal test tank, measuring 15 cm height × 27 cm top × 23.5 cm bottom × 6 cm width. tank water ph and salinity was adjusted to match the conditions of the home-tanks. the experiment was recorded by a side-view camera for 20 min, using the program debut video capture software. recorded videos were analysed offline using topscan analysis system. during analysis, the test tank was virtually divided into 3 vertical zones, to denote top, middle, and bottom areas of the tank. at the end of the experimental day, a fin clip was taken from each fish during anesthesia with 164 mg/l ms-222 for genotyping. post-clipping fish were kept individually in separate tanks for 24 h before returning to their home tank, and then used as brood stock once fins were healed. cortisol sampling and extraction in adult fish whole-body cortisol levels were measured from mixed-sex and equally-sized zebrafish that were experimentally naïve and left undisturbed prior to sampling. cortisol was extracted in three independent experiments from six adult mecp2 −/− and six control mecp2 +/+ zebrafish as described previously [ 93 ].cortisol was extracted in three independent experiments from six adult mecp2 −/− and six control mecp2 +/+ zebrafish as described previously [ 93 ]. briefly, each body sample was collected, weighed, and then dissected on ice into sections for homogenization. each sample was mixed with 5.0 ml of diethyl ether, vortexed for 1 min, and centrifuged at 3500 rpm for 5 min. once the ether was evaporated, the lipid cortisol residue was reconstituted in 1.0 ml of pbs. the extract was assayed for cortisol following manufacturer’s guidelines for high-sensitivity salivary cortisol enzyme immunoassay kit (salimetrics, pa, usa < catalogue no. 1–3002). samples, standards, and controls were run in triplicates and reaction intensity was measured using a plate reader. cortisol calculations (ng/g) were standardized to body weight and buffer volume for individual fish. statistics and data analysis larval and juvenile behaviour videos were tracked using offline automated functions in ethovision xt version 14 (noldus) software while the adult behaviour videos were tracked using topscan (cleversys) offline automated tracking. statistical analyses were performed using ibm spss statistics version 25 and group differences were considered significant when p < 0.05. generally, after considering normality and homogeneity of variances, hypothesis testing on multiple group experimental design experiments was done using linear models (anovas or wilcoxon/kruskal–wallis tests) followed by suitable post-hoc contrasts if appropriate. data were analyzed for main effects of genotype and ptz-concentration [between-subject factors] and time [before and after ptz-treatment or social stimulus as within-subject factor] as appropriate. two-way anovas were used for evaluation of effects of genotype and breeding [homozygous vs heterozygous parents], followed by tukey’s multiple comparisons tests. repeated measure anovas were used for comparisons of mean values from multiple groups or time points. unpaired or nested t-tests were used for comparisons of mean values from two genotype groups, as appropriate. if a main effect or interaction was found, post-hoc tests (t-tests, one-way anovas, or dunn's multiple comparisons test) were carried out for direction of effect, as applicable. as sex cannot be determined in larval fish at 5 dpf and 21 dpf, we examined only adult data for any potential sex differences, and when no sex-effects existed, male and female data were pooled together for analysis. to test null-hypotheses regarding differences between mecp2 +/+ and mecp2 −/− fish, we acknowledge well-established and reproducible main effects of time/habituation and ptz concentrations briefly and focused primarily on reporting only main effects of genotype and all significant interactions involving genotype. results five dpf mecp2 −/− fish displayed hypolocomotion, but no difference in ptz-induced hyperlocomotion locomotion of 5 dpf larvae was tested in two sets of fish, offspring from homozygous parents ( mecp2 +/+ males bred with mecp2 +/+ females; mecp2 −/− males with mecp2 −/− females; resulting in only two homozygous genotypes) and from heterozygous parents ( mecp2 +/− x mecp2 +/− ; resulting in all three genotypes). homozygous in-crosses control for any confounding effects of maternally deposited wildtype mecp2 transcripts but has a drawback of comparing non-siblings. conversely, siblings from heterozygous crosses provide control for any clutch/family differences but all embryos acquire maternally deposited mecp2 [ 63 ]. when testing 5 dpf larvae from homozygous breeding, we found mecp2 −/− fish moved significantly less (fig. 2 a; t = 6.142, df = 318, p < 0.0001) than mecp2 +/+ fish, and although five gradually higher concentrations of ptz (0, 1, 2.5, 5, 7.5, 10 mm) increased locomotion in a dose-dependent way (p < 0.05, for main effect of ptz), there were no differences between mecp2 +/+ and mecp2 −/− fish in ptz-induced hyperlocomotion (fig. 2 b; p > 0.05, for all ptz concentrations). likewise, the mecp2 −/− fish from heterozygous parents also moved shorter distances (fig. 2 c; t = 2.448, df = 156, p = 0.016) before ptz-treatment compared to their mecp2 + / + siblings, and these fish were comparable to fish from homozygous crosses. while ptz (control and two concentrations: 0, 5, and 10 mm) increased locomotion (fig. 2 d; p < 0.05, for main effect of ptz) in all 5 dpf sibling larvae from heterozygous parents, there were no main effects of genotype on ptz-induced hyperlocomotion (fig. 2 d; p < 0.05). statistically significant differences in movement within genotypes between baseline and ptz-treatment are presented in table 2 . overall, these results show that mecp2 −/− zebrafish at 5 dpf, from both homozygous and heterozygous crosses, displayed hypolocomotion at baseline but reacted similarly to ptz treatment as compared to the control groups. fig. 2 larval locomotion behaviour was similarly affected in mecp2 −/− fish bred from homozygous parents (top panel) and heterozygous parents (bottom panel). a baseline locomotion prior to ptz-treatment for 5 dpf larvae from homozygous breeding showed that mecp2 −/− (n = 117) larvae moved significantly shorter distances than mecp2 + / + (n = 203). b distances moved by mecp2 + / + (blue; n = 33–35) and mecp2 −/− (red; n = 19–20) fish from homozygous parents were similar during baseline (20 min before; lighter colours) and showed similar increases during ptz-treatment (20 min, darker colours). c baseline locomotion prior to ptz-treatment for 5 dpf larvae from heterozygous mecp2 +/− crosses showed that mecp2 −/− (n = 68) larvae moved significantly shorter distances than mecp2 + / + (n = 90). d the distances moved were similar during baseline (20 min before; lighter colours) and the hyperlocomotion during ptz-treatment (20 min, darker colours) was also similar in 5 dpf mecp2 + / + , mecp2 +/− , and mecp2 + / + fish derived from heterozygous breeding. sample sizes were mecp2 + / + (blue; n = 41–65), mecp2 +/− (purple; n = 86–90) and mecp2 −/− (red; n = 35–37). significant effects of ptz-treatment within genotypes are indicated in grey. ****p < 0.0001 and *p < 0.05. mean values shown as dotted lines and brackets mark

table mecp2 −/− zebrafish larvae do not display altered social preference at 21 dpf to determine any effects of mecp2 null-mutation on social preference and locomotion in three-week old fish, mecp2 −/− and mecp2 +/− zebrafish were compared to wildtype mecp2 + / + siblings from heterozygous breeding during baseline and social phases. the spi distributions for social phase were not normal and non-parametric tests were used for determining the effect of genotype and visual social access. as illustrated in fig. 3 a, kruskal–wallis tests showed no main effect of genotype during baseline (p = 0.702) and social (0.922) phases. wilcoxon signed rank test revealed that heterozygous mecp2 +/− fish (p < 0.001) showed significantly stronger bias for the zone adjacent to social stimulus (p = 0.140 for mecp2 +/+ ; p = 0.0816 for mecp2 −/− ). fig. 3 social preference index, time spent in the social zone, and total distance moved by 21 dpf zebrafish during baseline and social stimulus phases. social preference ( a ) was not altered in mecp2 (n = 77) or mecp2 −/− (n = 37) larvae compared to mecp2 + / + (n = 23) zebrafish. additionally, sibling zebrafish of all three genotypes spent similar length of time in the social zone ( b ) and swam similar distances ( c ) during the baseline and stimulus phases of the experiment. ****p < 0.0001 ***p < 0.001 **p < 0.01 and *p < 0.05. mean ± sem full size image we also compared time spent in social zone separately as well and all three groups displayed stronger bias towards social zone in the social phase of the test. no main effect of genotype was detected (fig. 3 b; p > 0.05 for both baseline and social phase; kruskal–wallis test) and significantly more time was spent in the adjacent social zone during visual social access by for mecp2 +/+ , mecp2 +/− , and mecp2 −/− (fig. 3 b; p = 0.009, p < 0.0001, and p < 0.0001, respectively; wilcoxon signed ranks tests). lastly, we analyzed total distances moved during baseline and social phases of the social preference test and a repeated-measures anova showed a significant decrease in overall movement during visual access to social stimulus (fig. 3 c; f (1,132) = 24.735, p < 0.001) but no main effect or interaction of genotype on distances moved. overall, zebrafish at 21 dpf displayed similar levels of locomotion and social preference regardless of their mecp2 genotype. anxiety behaviours in adult mecp2 −/− fish were affected but not open-field locomotion to get a better understanding of movement and anxiety-related behaviours in adult mecp2 −/− fish, responses of 6-months old adult mecp2 −/− and mecp2 + / + fish individually placed in a large open-field were observed. both genotype groups displayed similar locomotion and there was no main effect of genotype on total distances moved (fig. 4 a; p > 0.05; t-test). for analysis of thigmotaxis (wall-hugging) behaviour in adult mecp2 −/− fish, we also examined time spent in center vs. periphery of the testing tank. there was a main effect of genotype (fig. 4 b; t = 2.026, df = 64, p = 0.047) confirming that overall mecp2 −/− fish spent less time in the center zone during undisturbed observation. as indicated in fig. 4 c, all fish spent progressively more time in the center during the baseline, with male mecp2 −/− fish showed less thigmotaxis compared to female mecp2 −/− fish, and repeated-measures anova showed a time x sex x genotype interaction (f (9, 558) = 3.418, p = 0.0004) and a significant effect of time (f (9, 558) = 20.98, p < 0.0001), but there were no main effects of genotype or sex for time spent in periphery. thus, adult zebrafish displayed similar levels of locomotion regardless of their mecp2 genotype whereas the mecp2 −/− fish displayed less time in the center zone indicating increased anxiety-like response compared to controls. fig. 4 anxiety-related behaviours and whole-body cortisol levels were altered in adult mecp2 −/− fish while locomotion and social preference were unaffected. locomotion in the open-field ( a ) was not affected but adult mecp2 −/− fish spend significantly less time in the ( b ) centre zone in the open field compared to the mecp2 + / + group and ( c ) male mecp2 −/− fish showed somewhat less time in the periphery, compared to female mecp2 −/− fish. during the presentation of social stimuli, time spent in the social zone ( d ) was not significantly different in adult mecp2 −/− (n = 43) as compared to mecp2 + / + (n = 22). while mecp2 −/− fish generally trended towards more time closer to social stimuli than mecp2 + / + fish across the 15 min ( e ) the spi was not different between the two groups of fish (f ). in a novel tank diving task, the mecp2 −/− (n = 22) zebrafish made less bottom-to-middle transitions ( g ) and spent less time in high-mobility state ( h ) and more time in the immobile state (i) as compared to mecp2 +/+ (n = 10) indicating an increase in bottom-dwelling and freezing behaviours, but overall time spent in bottom, middle, and top areas ( j ) was not different between the two genotypes. baseline cortisol levels ( k ) were higher in experimentally naïve mecp2 −/− (n = 6) fish compared to mecp2 + / + (n = 6) zebrafish. *p < 0.05 and ****p < 0.0001. mean ± sem full size image mecp2 −/− zebrafish do not display altered social preference in adulthood both genotypes responded to social stimuli and spent similar length of time in the social zone when exposed to the conspecific shoals. we compared total time spent in social zone, time across the 15 min of social stimuli availability, and spi, and found no differences between adult mecp2 −/− and mecp2 + / + (fig. 4 d, e, f; p > 0.05; t-tests). overall, parallel to three-week-old zebrafish, adult fish also displayed similar levels of social preference regardless of their mecp2 genotype. adult mecp2 −/− zebrafish display increased anxiety behaviour in a novel tank in the novel tank diving paradigm, we found a reduction in the number of bottom-to-middle transitions made by the mecp2 −/− fish (fig. 4 g; t = 2.080, df = 30, p = 0.0461). we also found that the duration of time in high mobility state was significantly reduced (fig. 4 h; t = 2.502, df = 30, p = 0.0181) and time being immobile was significantly increased (fig. 4 i; t = 2.093, df = 30, p = 0.0449) in the mecp2 −/− group compared to the mecp2 +/+ fish, even while time spent in bottom, middle, and top sections of the novel tank did not differ between the genotypes (fig. 4 j; t = 0.0014, df = 4, p = 0.994; nested t-test). taken together, these results indicate that adult mecp2 −/− zebrafish displayed elevated levels of anxiety behaviours, such as bottom-dwelling and freezing. adult mecp2 −/− zebrafish have higher cortisol levels lacking functional mecp2 affected resting whole-body cortisol levels in experimentally naïve unstressed fish. compared to mecp2 +/+ fish, similarly sized mecp2 −/− fish had higher cortisol levels (fig. 4 k; t = 6.512, df = 10, p < 0.0001) in their bodies. thus, cortisol levels were elevated in adult mecp2 −/− zebrafish compared to controls. discussion in the current study of the zebrafish mecp2 gene, we replicated the previous finding that mecp2 q63x zebrafish larvae exhibit hypolocomotion compared to mecp2 + / + fish [ 64 ]. our results also revealed that the gaba a receptor antagonist ptz induced hyperlocomotion similarly in mecp2 −/− , mecp2 +/− , and mecp2 + / + siblings. to our knowledge, this is the first analysis of social and anxiety behaviour and cortisol levels of adult mecp2 q63x zebrafish. we found that mecp2 −/− zebrafish moved less and displayed higher anxiety behaviours and higher cortisol levels compared to mecp2 + / + fish. interestingly, our results also revealed that mecp2 −/− fish showed similar social preference as mecp2 + / + , both during ontogeny of social behaviour at 21 dpf larvae and as mature form of adulthood socialization. recently, several zebrafish mutant lines lacking genes linked to neurodevelopmental disorders have shown phenotypic seizure-like behaviour [ 92 , 94 – 97 ], social dysfunction [ 86 , 98 , 99 ] and locomotion abnormalities as well as changes in activity and morphology of relevant brain regions [ 96 , 100 ]. previously, zebrafish mecp2 gene manipulation studies have showed recapitulation of milder rett syndrome phenotypes in mutants and morphants, such as motor abnormalities and changes in larval anxiety behaviour [ 64 ] and transcriptomic and proteomic analyses have suggested impaired visual function and energy metabolism in mecp2 q63x fish [ 66 , 67 ]. exposure to genotoxic and environmental regulators such as morphine [ 77 ], alcohol [ 69 ], chronic bpa [ 74 ], crude oil and lead [ 75 ] have also been shown to regulate mecp2 expression and mecp2 function in zebrafish. altogether, these studies have further increased value of zebrafish models of rett syndrome and provided additional impetus to characterize motor, social, stress, and anxiety-like behaviour in developmental and adult mecp2 q63x fish. locomotion profile of mecp2 q63x fish similar to the current study, previously loss-of-function of mecp2 has been reported to cause hypolocomotion in 5–6 dpf larval zebrafish [ 64 ]. furthermore, morpholino-mediated knockdown of mecp2 led to a decrease in motor activity as early as 28 hpf in zebrafish morphants [ 78 ]. the hypolocomotion phenotype in larval zebrafish was suggested to be caused by an increase in abnormal axonal branches of caudal primary motor neurons [ 78 ] whereas selective activation of cholinergic neurotransmission reversed the locomotor impairment in mice [ 101 ]. while we did not find any differences in locomotion of adult mecp2 −/− and mecp2 + / + fish in the open-field, higher levels of freezing and bottom-dwelling were seen in the novel tank test of adult mecp2 −/− fish. here it is relevant to note that using the same null-mutation model and proteomics, impairments in energy metabolism, redox balance, and structure and function of cardiac and skeletal muscle in larval and adult fish have been suggested [ 66 ]. while our tests induced some anxiety for short durations, evaluation of mecp2 −/− fish in longer and more exhaustive motor tasks requiring more energy expenditure and higher muscle performance would shed light on behavioural consequences of altered proteomes. stress and anxiety-related behaviours in mecp2 q63x fish the elevated anxiety behaviour and higher cortisol levels observed in the mecp2 q63x zebrafish are of interest as these mimic frequently displayed heightened anxiety and mood fluctuation symptoms [ 10 , 11 , 19 , 23 , 24 ] and related aberrant hpa-axis function in rett syndrome patients, including increased cortisol levels [ 19 , 21 – 23 ]. also, mouse mecp2 has been reported to regulate stress vulnerability [ 46 ] and key genes in the hpa axis [ 47 , 102 , 103 ], and mice with truncated mecp2 allele have increased expression of corticotropin-releasing hormone and elevated levels of corticosterone in response to stress [ 104 ]. we purposely tested baseline cortisol levels in experimentally naïve fish as novel environments and handling during behavioural procedures can induce stress and led to changes in whole-body cortisol. while circulating levels of cortisol and corticosterone oscillate with circadian clock of the body and do not have a one-to-one relationship with psychological stress [ 105 ], higher resting cortisol levels observed in the mecp2 q63x mutant fish provide evidence of altered stress function linked to mecp2 null-mutation. future mecp2 q63x zebrafish studies with comparison of cortisol levels in resting and induced acute and chronic stress conditions, along with pharmacological treatments with anxiolytics and antidepressants would be valuable in further clarification of links between mecp2 deficiency and aberrant hpa-axis function in rett syndrome patients. in line with our results, mecp2 knockout mice have been reported to display increased anxiety-like behaviours [ 101 , 104 , 106 ], whereas stearns et al. [ 107 ] found decreased anxiety-like behaviour in mutant mecp2 mice and samaco et al. [ 47 ] showed that overexpression of mecp2 also increases anxiety-related behaviours in mice. thus, investigations of anxiety-related behaviours in animal models of rett syndrome have so far yielded some inconsistent findings across as well as within species, but the association with increased stress vulnerability and atypical stress responsiveness are fairly established. also, whereas we here show elevated anxiety when comparing adult mecp2 -/- zebrafish with mecp2 +/+ fish of the same age, a previous study doing the same comparison of 6 dpf zebrafish, carrying the same null-mutation, instead showed decreased anxiety [assessed using thigmotaxis or wall-hugging] [ 64 ]. these results, along with the locomotion findings, demonstrate distinct effects of mecp2 deletion in young and adult zebrafish, indicating that mecp2 may regulate behaviours differently during early development and adulthood. vision-based social behaviour in mecp2 q63x fish in contrast to patients with rett syndrome and mammalian models lacking functional mecp2, our investigations did not reveal any substantial role of mecp2 in the expression of social preference behaviour of 21 dpf mecp2 −/− larvae and adult mecp2 −/− fish. adult mecp2 knockout mice display a hypersocial phenotype in several studies whereas juvenile play behaviour was reduced in female rats [ 32 ]. aside from heightened anxiety mentioned above, the lack of differences in our social phenotype could also be a consequence of using behavioural tests that did not provide enough motivation or complexity of social interaction (for example, we used only one fish as social stimulus vs empty space for pfd 15 and visual-only access to a group of four conspecifics for adult fish). more stimulating social testing conditions may potentially disclose functional regulation of social behaviour by mecp2 in zebrafish, such as larger shoals, isolation-induced social behaviour, interactive shoaling with live conspecifics fish where test fish would swim in a group, or social buffering during stress, etc., and higher complexity of social interaction (such as social memory or recognition, and dyadic interactions seen during aggression or mating). nonetheless, the responses to vision-based social stimuli and novel environments in our study further suggest either no effects of lacking mecp2 on vision or compensation by additional factors in older 21 dpf and adult fish observed. future studies examining vision directly using higher-resolution observations and comprehensive investigations of shoaling, mating, and dyadic aggression dynamics in zebrafish mecp2 q63x fish will help elucidate these interactions. limitations a large number of patients with rett syndrome have intellectual disability and seizures. an obvious limitation of the current study is lack of cognitive evaluation of mecp2 q63x fish and future zebrafish studies using this model and other mecp2 manipulations should assess cognitive abilities in combination with social, motor and anxiety-like behaviours. our results indicated that pharmacological inhibition of gaba receptors induced a hyperlocomotion response similarly in all fish independently of the presence of the mecp2 protein. in contrast, mecp2 knockout mice display cortical discharges consistent with absence epilepsy [ 108 ] and loss of mecp2 specifically from forebrain excitatory neurons leads to cortical hyperexcitation and seizures [ 109 ], leading to suggestion of alterations of the balance between the excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission. thus, despite our finding, to fully exclude that mecp2 exert action on gaba signalling, and to explore any effects on glutamatergic functioning, future zebrafish studies should include alternative convulsants and electrophysiological recordings across development. considering the apparent and devastating deficits seen in humans carrying deficient mecp2, the lack of phenotypical differences in sociability and ptz-induced hyperlocomotion between mecp2 −/− and mecp2 + / + zebrafish are noticeable. our methodology does not allow distinction between seizure stages and thus well-established hypolocomotion in mecp2 −/− fish could mask ptz-induced changes. more comprehensive studies with electrophysiology and higher resolution observations are needed to confirm if the hypolocomotion is concealing the seizure-like activity or if the typical locomotion in ptz-treated mecp2 −/− larvae could be due to other factors (motivation, energy, etc.). taking in consideration the variability of symptoms seen in patients with rett syndrome, we cannot rule out the possibility that behavioural variations may exist at specific or later stages of zebrafish development—as seen in other animal models of the syndrome [ 110 ]. lastly, a caveat of using zebrafish models is that unlike humans, the zebrafish mecp2 gene is not on x-chromosome and sex determination in zebrafish is not influenced by sex chromosomes, but rather autosomal chromosomes and environmental factors play important roles. thus, while viable and fertile mecp2 −/− fish of both sexes can be studied, translation value of conclusions from zebrafish studies alone may be limited. conclusion dysfunction of mecp2, a protein vital for neuronal maturation and silencing of genes during growth and experience-dependent changes, is linked to rett syndrome, autism and other neurodevelopmental disorders. using a zebrafish model, we studied behaviour of young and adult zebrafish that lacked this protein and discovered that these fish mimic milder human symptoms of atypical movement and elevated anxiety, but overall vision and social behaviour were unaffected. in conclusion, the current study showed that zebrafish mecp2 modulates locomotion and anxiety but not sociability or ptz-induced hyperlocomotion. while this is the first study to explore adult behaviour in mecp2 −/− zebrafish, we have essentially raised more questions than answered. consequently, there is an urgent necessity to complement the existing enu-derived and tilling-selected line used in our experiments and create targeted mutant zebrafish models with greater precision. conditional mutants that reduce or eradicate mecp2 function at specific developmental timepoints or in specific brain areas and neuron-types during notable experiences (such as socialization or when exposed to stressful stimuli) can further help elucidate how experience-dependent neuronal changes are regulated by zebrafish mecp2. zebrafish research has grown exponentially with advancements in gene editing techniques, such as crispr-mediated base- and prime-editing, rna-editing, and combining brain-specific manipulation of mecp2 with high-throughput studies can make understanding of mecp2 function and potential therapeutic developments more feasible. availability of data and materials the datasets generated during and/or analysed during the current study and any

zebrafish husbandry zebrafish ( danio rerio ) were bred and housed at the university of gothenburg. breeding adults (parents of test fish), experimental fish, and additional stock ab fish used as social stimuli were housed in an automated recirculation system (aquaneering, san diego, usa), supplied by deionized water, and supplemented with pro reef salt (tropic marin, wartenberg, germany) and nahco 3 to maintain conductivity at 700–800 μs and ph between 7.2—7.4. adults and larvae were held in the same room under a 14:10 h light–dark cycle (light on between 8 am and 10 pm) and at temperature of 27–28 °c. starting from 6 days post-fertilization (dpf), fish were moved from the incubator to the system and fed three times per day with age-appropriate granulated fry food (zm-100, zm-200, zm-300, zm systems, winchester, uk) and brine shrimp nauplii ( artemia salina , zm fish foods, winchester, uk) from 10 dpf. adult fish were fed brine shrimp nauplii once a day and granular pellets (zm fish food, winchester, uk) twice a day. zebrafish were held at a density of approximately 30 embryos per petri dish during 0—5 dpf, 10 fish per litre during larval period [6—21 dpf], and 3–5 fish per litre as juveniles and adults. larval experimental work took place at 5 dpf or at 21 dpf, and all larvae were experimentally naïve. adult behavioural testing and cortisol sampling was done at 6-months of age. sample sizes were based on existing zebrafish behavioural studies of appropriate ages and our previous work [ 57 , 64 , 91 ]. a total of 672 experimental 5 dpf fish were used, 140 experimental fish (and 40 ab fish as social stimuli) were used for social preference testing at 21 dpf. also, 66 experimental fish (with 20 ab fish as social stimuli) were employed for adult behavioural tasks and 12 fish were used for cortisol analysis. adult experimental and stimuli fish and 21 dpf stimuli fish were re-used for other purposes (brood stock, social stimuli, other pilot work, etc.). an overview of the experimental protocol and example behavioural tracks are illustrated in fig. 1 . fig. 1 schematic representation of the experimental protocol at 5 days post-fertilization (dpf), 21 dpf, and 6-months old adult fish. experiments done at the three ages are separated and denoted with purple outline. blue arrows show timeline of procedures while orange dotted lines represent virtual division of testing arenas into relevant areas. for 5 dpf larval fish ( a ), general locomotion was observed during a baseline period, followed by ptz-induced hyperlocomotion. representative examples of behavioural traces are provided to illustrate typical locomotion (wells a1 and b2), immobility (well b1), and hyperlocomotion (well a2). for 21 dpf fish ( b ), three traces illustrate preference (top), indifference (middle), and aversion (bottom) to social stimuli. the dotted orange lines mark the social and non-social zone used for calculation of social preference index [spi]. for adult fish, the dotted orange lines indicate the line between border and center during ( c ) baseline open field testing, five zones during social preference testing ( d ) with zone 1 being closest to the shoal [social zone] and zone 5 being the furthest away from the shoal during social behavioural testing, and the division of water column into vertical top, middle and bottom areas ( e ) during novel tank diving test. representative traces below show bottom-dwelling vs. exploration in higher water column in the open-field, no preference vs. social preference during the social behaviour test, and exploration of bottom only, middle, and top areas of the novel tank. after the behavioural testing, all fish were ( f ) fin-clipped under anaesthesia for genotyping. separate group of experimentally naïve adult fish were used to measure whole-body cortisol levels ( g ) using enzyme immunoassay full size image ethical considerations experiments adhered strictly to a study protocol approved by the local animal ethics committee in gothenburg and followed the animal use and care guidelines of the swedish national board for laboratory animals (ethical permit # 5.8.18–08496/2018) and european directive 2010/63/eu. experiments were planned as per prepare guidelines (norecopa: norway's national consensus platform for the advancement of "the 3 rs") and data are reported here according to the arrive guidelines from the national centre for the replacement, refinement & reduction of animals in research of uk. mecp2 −/− zebrafish line maintenance and genotyping the previously described mecp2 −/− zebrafish line carrying mecp2 q63x mutation in a nacre background was used [ 64 ] as well as mecp2 +/+ siblings from the same parents. prior to this experimental work, this line had been appropriately outcrossed to ensure removal of any potential unintended mutations typically associated with enu-mutagenesis [ 64 ]. larvae from both heterozygous and homozygous crosses were used in experiments. heterozygous parents [ mecp2 +/− paired with mecp2 +/− ] generated offspring with all three genotypes while homozygous pairs ( mecp2 +/+ males bred with mecp2 +/+ females; mecp2 −/− males with mecp2 −/− females) generated only homozygous offspring genotypes. homozygous mecp2 -null parents [ mecp2 −/− x mecp2 −/− ] were used for in-crosses specifically to check for any confounding influence of maternally deposited wildtype mecp2 transcripts or mecp2 protein from heterozygous parents. age-matched wildtype ab zebrafish were raised to be used as stimuli animals for the social experiments. after the behavioural testing was performed as described below, all experimental 5 dpf and 21 dpf larvae were euthanized and adult fish were anesthetized and fin-clipped using age-appropriate ms-222 concentrations. larval fish and fin samples were sent to lgc service lab, uk for genotyping by kompetitive allele-specific pcr (kasp) for all experiments (except for the cortisol experiments, genotyping pcr for those were done in-house, as described before [ 64 ]. pentylenetetrazole (ptz) preparation and exposure, and locomotion assay for 5 dpf fish larval zebrafish of 5 dpf were used to examine if the mecp2 q63x fish showed a different locomotor response after treatment with ptz, compared to controls. the larvae were placed in 48-well plates with 1.6 ml of system water in each well. their behaviour was then recorded for 30 min to serve as a baseline, using a video camera (sony handycam hdr-cx405) mounted above the well plate. ptz stock solution (200 mm) was prepared on the same day as experimental testing was performed by dissolving ptz (sigma-aldrich) in milli-q water. the stock solution was diluted into the system water to get additional ptz-stocks and 0.5 ml of appropriate solutions were mixed with system water of the wells to get desired final concentrations [0, 1, 2.5, 5, 7.5, and 10 mm]. the final concentrations used were well-established and based on prior zebrafish studies that showed hyperlocomotion and induction of seizures (stage i and ii) in larval zebrafish [ 92 ]. following addition of ptz, behaviour during ptz exposure was recorded 30 min. immediately after the experiments, the animals were euthanized in 300 mg/l ms-222 solution, placed in individual pcr tubes on dry ice, and stored at −80 degrees until sent for kasp genotyping (see above). recorded videos of baseline and ptz-treated behaviour were analyzed offline using automated tracking functions of ethovision (noldus information technology, wageningen, netherlands) software. larval social behaviour assay for 21 dpf fish larval zebrafish of 21 dpf were used to investigate if young mecp2 q63x fish displayed different social preferences compared to controls, at the time-point when social behaviour first becomes observable. the social preference of mecp2 +/+ , mecp2 +/− and mecp2 −/− zebrafish larvae was examined by placing them individually in a u-shaped test arena (3.5 × 4.5 cm) with a transparent glass bottom, as previously described [ 57 , 91 ], placed on top of a light table and filmed from above using a video camera (sony handycam hdr-cx405). the test arenas had at each end a squared stimulus chamber which was separated from the test chamber by a wall of transparent glass. the stimulation chambers could be visually shielded from the test chamber by blinders made of opaque white plastic [ 57 , 91 ]. the experiment started when the experimental fish were placed in the test chamber, visually shielded by blinders from the social stimulus, which consisted of one ab fish of the same age. in each experiment 16–18 test fish were run in parallel, in test chambers that were visually separated [i.e., test fish could not see other test fish, stimuli, or the experimenters]. fish were recorded for 20 min during baseline open-exploration, and for 20 min after the opaque blinders were removed and social stimulus was visibly available. recorded videos of behaviour during baseline and social-stimulus conditions were analyzed offline using ethovision (noldus) automated tracking. a social preference index (spi) was calculated; the time spent in the non-social zone was subtracted from the time spent in the social zone and the result was divided by the total time [ 57 , 91 ]. fish (n = 3) that remained frozen for more than 50% of the time or did not enter both social and non-social zones during the baseline period were excluded from the analysis. open field test for adult fish the open field behaviour was observed in the baseline period of the first 10 min of the 6-months old adult social behaviour assay (described below) as adult mecp2 + / + and mecp2 −/− swim freely. the experimental set-up was comprised of one large test tank (60 cm × 30 cm), and two smaller side tanks (15 cm × 30 cm) that were positioned at the short ends of the test tank [ 91 ]. the water depth was 10 cm in both the test tank and in each of the side tanks. tank water was made daily from deionized water and salts (meersalt from tropic marin) and was ph and salinity adjusted to match the conditions of the home-tanks. the set-up was filmed from above using a video camera. experimental tanks were visually isolated from surroundings and the experimenters using black non-transparent plastic sheets; additionally with opaque blinders ensuring that the test tank was visually isolated from the side tanks containing social stimuli fish during the baseline period [10 min]. to measure thigmotaxis behaviour from the recorded movies, a periphery zone was defined as a 5 cm distance from sides of the tank, leaving a 50 × 20 cm center zone in the middle of the chamber. fish were tested individually, and the time spent in the defined periphery and center zones, along with total distances swam during the 10 min were quantified and compared between genotypes. recorded videos were analyzed offline using topscan behaviour analysis system (cleversys inc., reston, virginia, usa) software. social behaviour assay for adult fish adult zebrafish were used to examine if mecp2 −/− fish exhibited atypical social response compared to control mecp2 + / + fish in adulthood. the stimulus shoal consisting of four age-matched ab fish was placed in one of the two side tanks whilst the second tank remained empty, and the shoal side was counterbalanced during trials. for the data analysis in topscan behaviour analysis system, the bottom of the test tank was virtually divided into five equally sized horizontal zones. the zone closest to the shoal was zone one [social zone] with zone five being the furthest away from the shoal. the focal fish was first exposed to the social behaviour test (25 min duration, i.e., 10 min baseline period and 15 min with social stimuli), then it was gently netted to the novel tank diving set up. novel tank diving test for adult fish a subset of adult zebrafish was used to investigate if mecp2 −/− fish exhibited anxiety-like behaviour in response to a new environment compared to controls. the novel tank diving paradigm used one 1.5 l trapezoidal test tank, measuring 15 cm height × 27 cm top × 23.5 cm bottom × 6 cm width. tank water ph and salinity was adjusted to match the conditions of the home-tanks. the experiment was recorded by a side-view camera for 20 min, using the program debut video capture software. recorded videos were analysed offline using topscan analysis system. during analysis, the test tank was virtually divided into 3 vertical zones, to denote top, middle, and bottom areas of the tank. at the end of the experimental day, a fin clip was taken from each fish during anesthesia with 164 mg/l ms-222 for genotyping. post-clipping fish were kept individually in separate tanks for 24 h before returning to their home tank, and then used as brood stock once fins were healed. cortisol sampling and extraction in adult fish whole-body cortisol levels were measured from mixed-sex and equally-sized zebrafish that were experimentally naïve and left undisturbed prior to sampling. cortisol was extracted in three independent experiments from six adult mecp2 −/− and six control mecp2 +/+ zebrafish as described previously [ 93 ].cortisol was extracted in three independent experiments from six adult mecp2 −/− and six control mecp2 +/+ zebrafish as described previously [ 93 ]. briefly, each body sample was collected, weighed, and then dissected on ice into sections for homogenization. each sample was mixed with 5.0 ml of diethyl ether, vortexed for 1 min, and centrifuged at 3500 rpm for 5 min. once the ether was evaporated, the lipid cortisol residue was reconstituted in 1.0 ml of pbs. the extract was assayed for cortisol following manufacturer’s guidelines for high-sensitivity salivary cortisol enzyme immunoassay kit (salimetrics, pa, usa < catalogue no. 1–3002). samples, standards, and controls were run in triplicates and reaction intensity was measured using a plate reader. cortisol calculations (ng/g) were standardized to body weight and buffer volume for individual fish. statistics and data analysis larval and juvenile behaviour videos were tracked using offline automated functions in ethovision xt version 14 (noldus) software while the adult behaviour videos were tracked using topscan (cleversys) offline automated tracking. statistical analyses were performed using ibm spss statistics version 25 and group differences were considered significant when p < 0.05. generally, after considering normality and homogeneity of variances, hypothesis testing on multiple group experimental design experiments was done using linear models (anovas or wilcoxon/kruskal–wallis tests) followed by suitable post-hoc contrasts if appropriate. data were analyzed for main effects of genotype and ptz-concentration [between-subject factors] and time [before and after ptz-treatment or social stimulus as within-subject factor] as appropriate. two-way anovas were used for evaluation of effects of genotype and breeding [homozygous vs heterozygous parents], followed by tukey’s multiple comparisons tests. repeated measure anovas were used for comparisons of mean values from multiple groups or time points. unpaired or nested t-tests were used for comparisons of mean values from two genotype groups, as appropriate. if a main effect or interaction was found, post-hoc tests (t-tests, one-way anovas, or dunn's multiple comparisons test) were carried out for direction of effect, as applicable. as sex cannot be determined in larval fish at 5 dpf and 21 dpf, we examined only adult data for any potential sex differences, and when no sex-effects existed, male and female data were pooled together for analysis. to test null-hypotheses regarding differences between mecp2 +/+ and mecp2 −/− fish, we acknowledge well-established and reproducible main effects of time/habituation and ptz concentrations briefly and focused primarily on reporting only main effects of genotype and all significant interactions involving genotype. results five dpf mecp2 −/− fish displayed hypolocomotion, but no difference in ptz-induced hyperlocomotion locomotion of 5 dpf larvae was tested in two sets of fish, offspring from homozygous parents ( mecp2 +/+ males bred with mecp2 +/+ females; mecp2 −/− males with mecp2 −/− females; resulting in only two homozygous genotypes) and from heterozygous parents ( mecp2 +/− x mecp2 +/− ; resulting in all three genotypes). homozygous in-crosses control for any confounding effects of maternally deposited wildtype mecp2 transcripts but has a drawback of comparing non-siblings. conversely, siblings from heterozygous crosses provide control for any clutch/family differences but all embryos acquire maternally deposited mecp2 [ 63 ]. when testing 5 dpf larvae from homozygous breeding, we found mecp2 −/− fish moved significantly less (fig. 2 a; t = 6.142, df = 318, p < 0.0001) than mecp2 +/+ fish, and although five gradually higher concentrations of ptz (0, 1, 2.5, 5, 7.5, 10 mm) increased locomotion in a dose-dependent way (p < 0.05, for main effect of ptz), there were no differences between mecp2 +/+ and mecp2 −/− fish in ptz-induced hyperlocomotion (fig. 2 b; p > 0.05, for all ptz concentrations). likewise, the mecp2 −/− fish from heterozygous parents also moved shorter distances (fig. 2 c; t = 2.448, df = 156, p = 0.016) before ptz-treatment compared to their mecp2 + / + siblings, and these fish were comparable to fish from homozygous crosses. while ptz (control and two concentrations: 0, 5, and 10 mm) increased locomotion (fig. 2 d; p < 0.05, for main effect of ptz) in all 5 dpf sibling larvae from heterozygous parents, there were no main effects of genotype on ptz-induced hyperlocomotion (fig. 2 d; p < 0.05). statistically significant differences in movement within genotypes between baseline and ptz-treatment are presented in table 2 . overall, these results show that mecp2 −/− zebrafish at 5 dpf, from both homozygous and heterozygous crosses, displayed hypolocomotion at baseline but reacted similarly to ptz treatment as compared to the control groups. fig. 2 larval locomotion behaviour was similarly affected in mecp2 −/− fish bred from homozygous parents (top panel) and heterozygous parents (bottom panel). a baseline locomotion prior to ptz-treatment for 5 dpf larvae from homozygous breeding showed that mecp2 −/− (n = 117) larvae moved significantly shorter distances than mecp2 + / + (n = 203). b distances moved by mecp2 + / + (blue; n = 33–35) and mecp2 −/− (red; n = 19–20) fish from homozygous parents were similar during baseline (20 min before; lighter colours) and showed similar increases during ptz-treatment (20 min, darker colours). c baseline locomotion prior to ptz-treatment for 5 dpf larvae from heterozygous mecp2 +/− crosses showed that mecp2 −/− (n = 68) larvae moved significantly shorter distances than mecp2 + / + (n = 90). d the distances moved were similar during baseline (20 min before; lighter colours) and the hyperlocomotion during ptz-treatment (20 min, darker colours) was also similar in 5 dpf mecp2 + / + , mecp2 +/− , and mecp2 + / + fish derived from heterozygous breeding. sample sizes were mecp2 + / + (blue; n = 41–65), mecp2 +/− (purple; n = 86–90) and mecp2 −/− (red; n = 35–37). significant effects of ptz-treatment within genotypes are indicated in grey. ****p < 0.0001 and *p < 0.05. mean values shown as dotted lines and brackets mark

table mecp2 −/− zebrafish larvae do not display altered social preference at 21 dpf to determine any effects of mecp2 null-mutation on social preference and locomotion in three-week old fish, mecp2 −/− and mecp2 +/− zebrafish were compared to wildtype mecp2 + / + siblings from heterozygous breeding during baseline and social phases. the spi distributions for social phase were not normal and non-parametric tests were used for determining the effect of genotype and visual social access. as illustrated in fig. 3 a, kruskal–wallis tests showed no main effect of genotype during baseline (p = 0.702) and social (0.922) phases. wilcoxon signed rank test revealed that heterozygous mecp2 +/− fish (p < 0.001) showed significantly stronger bias for the zone adjacent to social stimulus (p = 0.140 for mecp2 +/+ ; p = 0.0816 for mecp2 −/− ). fig. 3 social preference index, time spent in the social zone, and total distance moved by 21 dpf zebrafish during baseline and social stimulus phases. social preference ( a ) was not altered in mecp2 (n = 77) or mecp2 −/− (n = 37) larvae compared to mecp2 + / + (n = 23) zebrafish. additionally, sibling zebrafish of all three genotypes spent similar length of time in the social zone ( b ) and swam similar distances ( c ) during the baseline and stimulus phases of the experiment. ****p < 0.0001 ***p < 0.001 **p < 0.01 and *p < 0.05. mean ± sem full size image we also compared time spent in social zone separately as well and all three groups displayed stronger bias towards social zone in the social phase of the test. no main effect of genotype was detected (fig. 3 b; p > 0.05 for both baseline and social phase; kruskal–wallis test) and significantly more time was spent in the adjacent social zone during visual social access by for mecp2 +/+ , mecp2 +/− , and mecp2 −/− (fig. 3 b; p = 0.009, p < 0.0001, and p < 0.0001, respectively; wilcoxon signed ranks tests). lastly, we analyzed total distances moved during baseline and social phases of the social preference test and a repeated-measures anova showed a significant decrease in overall movement during visual access to social stimulus (fig. 3 c; f (1,132) = 24.735, p < 0.001) but no main effect or interaction of genotype on distances moved. overall, zebrafish at 21 dpf displayed similar levels of locomotion and social preference regardless of their mecp2 genotype. anxiety behaviours in adult mecp2 −/− fish were affected but not open-field locomotion to get a better understanding of movement and anxiety-related behaviours in adult mecp2 −/− fish, responses of 6-months old adult mecp2 −/− and mecp2 + / + fish individually placed in a large open-field were observed. both genotype groups displayed similar locomotion and there was no main effect of genotype on total distances moved (fig. 4 a; p > 0.05; t-test). for analysis of thigmotaxis (wall-hugging) behaviour in adult mecp2 −/− fish, we also examined time spent in center vs. periphery of the testing tank. there was a main effect of genotype (fig. 4 b; t = 2.026, df = 64, p = 0.047) confirming that overall mecp2 −/− fish spent less time in the center zone during undisturbed observation. as indicated in fig. 4 c, all fish spent progressively more time in the center during the baseline, with male mecp2 −/− fish showed less thigmotaxis compared to female mecp2 −/− fish, and repeated-measures anova showed a time x sex x genotype interaction (f (9, 558) = 3.418, p = 0.0004) and a significant effect of time (f (9, 558) = 20.98, p < 0.0001), but there were no main effects of genotype or sex for time spent in periphery. thus, adult zebrafish displayed similar levels of locomotion regardless of their mecp2 genotype whereas the mecp2 −/− fish displayed less time in the center zone indicating increased anxiety-like response compared to controls. fig. 4 anxiety-related behaviours and whole-body cortisol levels were altered in adult mecp2 −/− fish while locomotion and social preference were unaffected. locomotion in the open-field ( a ) was not affected but adult mecp2 −/− fish spend significantly less time in the ( b ) centre zone in the open field compared to the mecp2 + / + group and ( c ) male mecp2 −/− fish showed somewhat less time in the periphery, compared to female mecp2 −/− fish. during the presentation of social stimuli, time spent in the social zone ( d ) was not significantly different in adult mecp2 −/− (n = 43) as compared to mecp2 + / + (n = 22). while mecp2 −/− fish generally trended towards more time closer to social stimuli than mecp2 + / + fish across the 15 min ( e ) the spi was not different between the two groups of fish (f ). in a novel tank diving task, the mecp2 −/− (n = 22) zebrafish made less bottom-to-middle transitions ( g ) and spent less time in high-mobility state ( h ) and more time in the immobile state (i) as compared to mecp2 +/+ (n = 10) indicating an increase in bottom-dwelling and freezing behaviours, but overall time spent in bottom, middle, and top areas ( j ) was not different between the two genotypes. baseline cortisol levels ( k ) were higher in experimentally naïve mecp2 −/− (n = 6) fish compared to mecp2 + / + (n = 6) zebrafish. *p < 0.05 and ****p < 0.0001. mean ± sem full size image mecp2 −/− zebrafish do not display altered social preference in adulthood both genotypes responded to social stimuli and spent similar length of time in the social zone when exposed to the conspecific shoals. we compared total time spent in social zone, time across the 15 min of social stimuli availability, and spi, and found no differences between adult mecp2 −/− and mecp2 + / + (fig. 4 d, e, f; p > 0.05; t-tests). overall, parallel to three-week-old zebrafish, adult fish also displayed similar levels of social preference regardless of their mecp2 genotype. adult mecp2 −/− zebrafish display increased anxiety behaviour in a novel tank in the novel tank diving paradigm, we found a reduction in the number of bottom-to-middle transitions made by the mecp2 −/− fish (fig. 4 g; t = 2.080, df = 30, p = 0.0461). we also found that the duration of time in high mobility state was significantly reduced (fig. 4 h; t = 2.502, df = 30, p = 0.0181) and time being immobile was significantly increased (fig. 4 i; t = 2.093, df = 30, p = 0.0449) in the mecp2 −/− group compared to the mecp2 +/+ fish, even while time spent in bottom, middle, and top sections of the novel tank did not differ between the genotypes (fig. 4 j; t = 0.0014, df = 4, p = 0.994; nested t-test). taken together, these results indicate that adult mecp2 −/− zebrafish displayed elevated levels of anxiety behaviours, such as bottom-dwelling and freezing. adult mecp2 −/− zebrafish have higher cortisol levels lacking functional mecp2 affected resting whole-body cortisol levels in experimentally naïve unstressed fish. compared to mecp2 +/+ fish, similarly sized mecp2 −/− fish had higher cortisol levels (fig. 4 k; t = 6.512, df = 10, p < 0.0001) in their bodies. thus, cortisol levels were elevated in adult mecp2 −/− zebrafish compared to controls. discussion in the current study of the zebrafish mecp2 gene, we replicated the previous finding that mecp2 q63x zebrafish larvae exhibit hypolocomotion compared to mecp2 + / + fish [ 64 ]. our results also revealed that the gaba a receptor antagonist ptz induced hyperlocomotion similarly in mecp2 −/− , mecp2 +/− , and mecp2 + / + siblings. to our knowledge, this is the first analysis of social and anxiety behaviour and cortisol levels of adult mecp2 q63x zebrafish. we found that mecp2 −/− zebrafish moved less and displayed higher anxiety behaviours and higher cortisol levels compared to mecp2 + / + fish. interestingly, our results also revealed that mecp2 −/− fish showed similar social preference as mecp2 + / + , both during ontogeny of social behaviour at 21 dpf larvae and as mature form of adulthood socialization. recently, several zebrafish mutant lines lacking genes linked to neurodevelopmental disorders have shown phenotypic seizure-like behaviour [ 92 , 94 – 97 ], social dysfunction [ 86 , 98 , 99 ] and locomotion abnormalities as well as changes in activity and morphology of relevant brain regions [ 96 , 100 ]. previously, zebrafish mecp2 gene manipulation studies have showed recapitulation of milder rett syndrome phenotypes in mutants and morphants, such as motor abnormalities and changes in larval anxiety behaviour [ 64 ] and transcriptomic and proteomic analyses have suggested impaired visual function and energy metabolism in mecp2 q63x fish [ 66 , 67 ]. exposure to genotoxic and environmental regulators such as morphine [ 77 ], alcohol [ 69 ], chronic bpa [ 74 ], crude oil and lead [ 75 ] have also been shown to regulate mecp2 expression and mecp2 function in zebrafish. altogether, these studies have further increased value of zebrafish models of rett syndrome and provided additional impetus to characterize motor, social, stress, and anxiety-like behaviour in developmental and adult mecp2 q63x fish. locomotion profile of mecp2 q63x fish similar to the current study, previously loss-of-function of mecp2 has been reported to cause hypolocomotion in 5–6 dpf larval zebrafish [ 64 ]. furthermore, morpholino-mediated knockdown of mecp2 led to a decrease in motor activity as early as 28 hpf in zebrafish morphants [ 78 ]. the hypolocomotion phenotype in larval zebrafish was suggested to be caused by an increase in abnormal axonal branches of caudal primary motor neurons [ 78 ] whereas selective activation of cholinergic neurotransmission reversed the locomotor impairment in mice [ 101 ]. while we did not find any differences in locomotion of adult mecp2 −/− and mecp2 + / + fish in the open-field, higher levels of freezing and bottom-dwelling were seen in the novel tank test of adult mecp2 −/− fish. here it is relevant to note that using the same null-mutation model and proteomics, impairments in energy metabolism, redox balance, and structure and function of cardiac and skeletal muscle in larval and adult fish have been suggested [ 66 ]. while our tests induced some anxiety for short durations, evaluation of mecp2 −/− fish in longer and more exhaustive motor tasks requiring more energy expenditure and higher muscle performance would shed light on behavioural consequences of altered proteomes. stress and anxiety-related behaviours in mecp2 q63x fish the elevated anxiety behaviour and higher cortisol levels observed in the mecp2 q63x zebrafish are of interest as these mimic frequently displayed heightened anxiety and mood fluctuation symptoms [ 10 , 11 , 19 , 23 , 24 ] and related aberrant hpa-axis function in rett syndrome patients, including increased cortisol levels [ 19 , 21 – 23 ]. also, mouse mecp2 has been reported to regulate stress vulnerability [ 46 ] and key genes in the hpa axis [ 47 , 102 , 103 ], and mice with truncated mecp2 allele have increased expression of corticotropin-releasing hormone and elevated levels of corticosterone in response to stress [ 104 ]. we purposely tested baseline cortisol levels in experimentally naïve fish as novel environments and handling during behavioural procedures can induce stress and led to changes in whole-body cortisol. while circulating levels of cortisol and corticosterone oscillate with circadian clock of the body and do not have a one-to-one relationship with psychological stress [ 105 ], higher resting cortisol levels observed in the mecp2 q63x mutant fish provide evidence of altered stress function linked to mecp2 null-mutation. future mecp2 q63x zebrafish studies with comparison of cortisol levels in resting and induced acute and chronic stress conditions, along with pharmacological treatments with anxiolytics and antidepressants would be valuable in further clarification of links between mecp2 deficiency and aberrant hpa-axis function in rett syndrome patients. in line with our results, mecp2 knockout mice have been reported to display increased anxiety-like behaviours [ 101 , 104 , 106 ], whereas stearns et al. [ 107 ] found decreased anxiety-like behaviour in mutant mecp2 mice and samaco et al. [ 47 ] showed that overexpression of mecp2 also increases anxiety-related behaviours in mice. thus, investigations of anxiety-related behaviours in animal models of rett syndrome have so far yielded some inconsistent findings across as well as within species, but the association with increased stress vulnerability and atypical stress responsiveness are fairly established. also, whereas we here show elevated anxiety when comparing adult mecp2 -/- zebrafish with mecp2 +/+ fish of the same age, a previous study doing the same comparison of 6 dpf zebrafish, carrying the same null-mutation, instead showed decreased anxiety [assessed using thigmotaxis or wall-hugging] [ 64 ]. these results, along with the locomotion findings, demonstrate distinct effects of mecp2 deletion in young and adult zebrafish, indicating that mecp2 may regulate behaviours differently during early development and adulthood. vision-based social behaviour in mecp2 q63x fish in contrast to patients with rett syndrome and mammalian models lacking functional mecp2, our investigations did not reveal any substantial role of mecp2 in the expression of social preference behaviour of 21 dpf mecp2 −/− larvae and adult mecp2 −/− fish. adult mecp2 knockout mice display a hypersocial phenotype in several studies whereas juvenile play behaviour was reduced in female rats [ 32 ]. aside from heightened anxiety mentioned above, the lack of differences in our social phenotype could also be a consequence of using behavioural tests that did not provide enough motivation or complexity of social interaction (for example, we used only one fish as social stimulus vs empty space for pfd 15 and visual-only access to a group of four conspecifics for adult fish). more stimulating social testing conditions may potentially disclose functional regulation of social behaviour by mecp2 in zebrafish, such as larger shoals, isolation-induced social behaviour, interactive shoaling with live conspecifics fish where test fish would swim in a group, or social buffering during stress, etc., and higher complexity of social interaction (such as social memory or recognition, and dyadic interactions seen during aggression or mating). nonetheless, the responses to vision-based social stimuli and novel environments in our study further suggest either no effects of lacking mecp2 on vision or compensation by additional factors in older 21 dpf and adult fish observed. future studies examining vision directly using higher-resolution observations and comprehensive investigations of shoaling, mating, and dyadic aggression dynamics in zebrafish mecp2 q63x fish will help elucidate these interactions. limitations a large number of patients with rett syndrome have intellectual disability and seizures. an obvious limitation of the current study is lack of cognitive evaluation of mecp2 q63x fish and future zebrafish studies using this model and other mecp2 manipulations should assess cognitive abilities in combination with social, motor and anxiety-like behaviours. our results indicated that pharmacological inhibition of gaba receptors induced a hyperlocomotion response similarly in all fish independently of the presence of the mecp2 protein. in contrast, mecp2 knockout mice display cortical discharges consistent with absence epilepsy [ 108 ] and loss of mecp2 specifically from forebrain excitatory neurons leads to cortical hyperexcitation and seizures [ 109 ], leading to suggestion of alterations of the balance between the excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission. thus, despite our finding, to fully exclude that mecp2 exert action on gaba signalling, and to explore any effects on glutamatergic functioning, future zebrafish studies should include alternative convulsants and electrophysiological recordings across development. considering the apparent and devastating deficits seen in humans carrying deficient mecp2, the lack of phenotypical differences in sociability and ptz-induced hyperlocomotion between mecp2 −/− and mecp2 + / + zebrafish are noticeable. our methodology does not allow distinction between seizure stages and thus well-established hypolocomotion in mecp2 −/− fish could mask ptz-induced changes. more comprehensive studies with electrophysiology and higher resolution observations are needed to confirm if the hypolocomotion is concealing the seizure-like activity or if the typical locomotion in ptz-treated mecp2 −/− larvae could be due to other factors (motivation, energy, etc.). taking in consideration the variability of symptoms seen in patients with rett syndrome, we cannot rule out the possibility that behavioural variations may exist at specific or later stages of zebrafish development—as seen in other animal models of the syndrome [ 110 ]. lastly, a caveat of using zebrafish models is that unlike humans, the zebrafish mecp2 gene is not on x-chromosome and sex determination in zebrafish is not influenced by sex chromosomes, but rather autosomal chromosomes and environmental factors play important roles. thus, while viable and fertile mecp2 −/− fish of both sexes can be studied, translation value of conclusions from zebrafish studies alone may be limited. conclusion dysfunction of mecp2, a protein vital for neuronal maturation and silencing of genes during growth and experience-dependent changes, is linked to rett syndrome, autism and other neurodevelopmental disorders. using a zebrafish model, we studied behaviour of young and adult zebrafish that lacked this protein and discovered that these fish mimic milder human symptoms of atypical movement and elevated anxiety, but overall vision and social behaviour were unaffected. in conclusion, the current study showed that zebrafish mecp2 modulates locomotion and anxiety but not sociability or ptz-induced hyperlocomotion. while this is the first study to explore adult behaviour in mecp2 −/− zebrafish, we have essentially raised more questions than answered. consequently, there is an urgent necessity to complement the existing enu-derived and tilling-selected line used in our experiments and create targeted mutant zebrafish models with greater precision. conditional mutants that reduce or eradicate mecp2 function at specific developmental timepoints or in specific brain areas and neuron-types during notable experiences (such as socialization or when exposed to stressful stimuli) can further help elucidate how experience-dependent neuronal changes are regulated by zebrafish mecp2. zebrafish research has grown exponentially with advancements in gene editing techniques, such as crispr-mediated base- and prime-editing, rna-editing, and combining brain-specific manipulation of mecp2 with high-throughput studies can make understanding of mecp2 function and potential therapeutic developments more feasible. availability of data and materials the datasets generated during and/or analysed during the current study and any

the behavioural tests showed that mecp2 −/− zebrafish displayed hypolocomotion at the larval stage, along with increased freezing time and thigmotaxis, and higher whole-body cortisol levels in adulthood. however, the hyper-locomotion response to ptz at 5 dpf and social preference for visual social stimulus at 21 dpf and in adulthood were not affected by the lack of functional mecp2. conclusions functional mecp2 modulated larval locomotion and behavioural anxiety at different ages and adult cortisol levels, but mecp2 null-mutation did not alter adult locomotion and socialization, and developmental sociability and ptz-induced hyperlocomotion in zebrafish. given the variability reported in patients and in rodent mecp2 knockout models, studies using zebrafish can explore vital elements of mecp2’s role across development and improve our understanding of neural mechanisms underlying neurodevelopmental disorders. peer review reports introduction mecp2 (methyl cpg binding protein 2) is essential for maturation and optimal functioning of neurons and non-neuronal cells as a global transcription regulator [ 1 , 2 ]. under- and overexpression of mecp2 is linked to rett syndrome, mecp2 duplication syndrome, and various other neuropathologies and developmental disorders [ 3 – 5 ]. the x-linked mecp2 gene is ubiquitously expressed, and the mecp2 protein binds to methylated cpg dinucleotides and other non-cpg motifs [ 1 ], and modulates activity-dependent neuronal transcription of genes [ 2 ] in the vicinity of the methylated sequence. upon synaptic activity, mecp2 gets phosphorylated which controls its repressor activity through recruitment of histone deacetylase and the corepressor sin3a, and in turn regulates experience-dependent dendritic growth and spine maturation in the brain [ 6 – 8 ]. over 600 mutations in the mecp2 gene have been identified as the major cause [ 5 ] of the progressive neurodevelopmental disorder rett syndrome [ 3 , 4 ]. in humans, rett syndrome is a monogenic disorder that primarily affects girls as the males fetuses do not tend to survive [ 9 ]. following seemingly typical prenatal and infant development, rett syndrome has an early onset [~ 6–12 months of age] and a characteristic disease pattern of rapid and progressive developmental delay, regression, and loss of motor and language skills [between 12–30 months] along with gait impairments and repetitive hand stereotypies [ 10 , 11 ]. this regression is followed by a longer plateau stage with stable abilities and symptoms for several years and can be followed by a later deterioration stage [5–25 years of age] with further reduction in motor skills [ 10 – 12 ]. although the first disease-modifying treatment trofinetide, a synthetic analog of glycine–proline–glutamate, the n-terminal tripeptide of the insulin-like growth factor 1 protein [igf1], was approved by the fda recently [ 13 , 14 ], treatment of rett syndrome have been mainly symptomatic [ 15 ]. the typical symptoms of this syndrome are lack of intentional hand movements, intellectual disability, language difficulties, repetitive movements, autonomic dysfunction, poor eye contact, and social behavioural problems [ 16 – 18 ]. additionally, seizures, heart problems, gastrointestinal and sleep abnormalities, heightened anxiety and stress responses [ 19 , 20 ], and aberration in stress hormone, cortisol [ 21 – 23 ], have been reported in these patients. while abrupt changes in mood, irritability, and heightened anxiety are not clinically diagnostic for rett syndrome, recent natural history and care-giving studies have identified these to be significant concerns by care-givers and commonly treated using anxiolytics and anti-depressants [ 10 – 12 , 19 , 20 , 24 ]. therefore, there is a great need for model systems for evaluating pharmaceutical, biologic, and gene therapies that may relieve and ameliorate symptoms of rett syndrome, including motor, social, mood, and anxiety symptoms. animal models that mimic the phenotype of rett syndrome have been generated by knocking out mecp2 in mice [ 25 – 30 ], rats [ 31 , 32 ], and primates [ 33 ]. in addition, disease models using human neurons derived from stem cells (ipscs) from patients with rett syndrome offer the potential of high-throughput drug screening [ 34 – 38 ] while patient-derived, gene-edited, and knock-out cortical organoid models can also allow better recapitulation of variability and complexity seen in rett syndrome [ 39 – 42 ]. extensive animal studies mainly in mice reveal that loss of mecp2 expression results in cognitive impairments [ 43 , 44 ], abnormal gait and reduced locomotor activity [ 45 ], increase vulnerability to stress and premature death [ 2 , 46 , 47 ], and alters specific aspects of synaptic physiology and neurotransmission that may impact the balance of excitation/inhibition [e/i balance] in the brain [ 48 – 50 ] but specific signalling pathways underlining behavioural and neuronal abnormalities phenocopied in mutant mice remain unknown. additionally, similar to many other neuropathologies, promising treatments from various mice studies focusing on mecp2 show no or limited translational effectiveness. the lack of phenotypic complexity in in-vitro cell and coculture models and the variance, subtlety, and mildness in phenotypes [ 51 , 52 ] of onset, progression, and lethality reported in hemizygous male and heterozygous female mouse models necessitate additional model systems with sufficient phenotypic complexity and practical simplicity. the zebrafish offers a complementing model with several advantages over mammalian and cell/culture model systems as an excellent tool with availability of sophisticated genetic manipulation techniques, high-throughput screening approaches [ 53 , 54 ], and detailed investigations of behaviours, such as locomotion and sociability [ 55 – 60 ], and anxiety [ 45 , 61 , 62 ]. zebrafish mecp2 shows similarity [ 63 ] in amino acid sequence [43%] and expression patterns in adult brains and across development, and the mecp2 gene is autosomal [chromosome 8 and not x-chromosome] [ 64 ]. null mecp2 −/− zebrafish are viable and fertile allowing both sexes to be studied, along with feasibility of studying potential epigenetic and transgenerational effects. to study neurodevelopmental roles and to identify previously unknown functions and novel mechanisms of mecp2, unique features of the zebrafish can be particularly important such as producing large numbers of externally fertilized transparent embryos that can be tracked experimentally into juvenile and adult stages. the small size, rapid external development, and robust locomotor, anxiety, and feeding behaviours exhibited by larval zebrafish within a few days post-fertilization (dpf) could be greatly revealing in studying the earliest effects of mecp2-deficiency that eventually leads to pathology. additionally, while juvenile and adult zebrafish show a wide range of complex social, affective, and cognitive behaviours, the adult zebrafish brain retains higher level of neurogenesis mimicking mammalian embryonic brain [ 65 ]. zebrafish are also diurnal, rely on their vision more than olfaction for social perception and processing, and have metabolic, physiological, and epigenetic mechanisms that more closely mirror human circadian oscillation. such advantages may be leveraged to provide greater understanding of variation in phenotypes seen in affected patients, differentiate between conflicting results seen in mouse models, and, shed more light on disparities reported between patients and mouse and other mammalian models. previous work with zebrafish mecp2 -null mutants have showed recapitulation of milder phenotypes of human rett syndrome symptoms. studies of zebrafish mecp2 including development of key mutant and morpholino-mediated models, environmental factors and pleiotropic interactions, and relevant upstream regulators of mecp2 and affected downstream pathways are summarized in the timeline in table 1 . aside from confirmation of motor impairments and changes in anxiety behaviour in the enu-derived and tilling-selected mecp2 -null zebrafish mecp2 q63x model [ 64 ], visual function and energy metabolism have also been suggested to be impaired [ 66 , 67 ]. in the current paper, to identify current progress, common themes, and any gaps and to gain a more comprehensive understanding of existing literature, particularly the mecp2 q63x model, we first briefly reviewed all published zebrafish mecp2 studies (table 1 ). to further substantiate the use of mecp2 −/− zebrafish as a model for rett syndrome and to investigate basic visual function, we measured general locomotion and anxiety-related behaviours at three different ages [5 dpf, 21 dpf, and 6-months of age], ptz-induced hyperlocomotion in larval 5 dpf fish, social preference for vision-based social stimuli when zebrafish start shoaling [21 dpf] and social, anxiety, and locomotion behaviour and cortisol levels in adulthood in mecp2 −/− zebrafish. table 1 chronological history of key developments and significant discoveries of zebrafish mecp2 structure, expression, and function full size table materials and methods zebrafish husbandry zebrafish ( danio rerio ) were bred and housed at the university of gothenburg. breeding adults (parents of test fish), experimental fish, and additional stock ab fish used as social stimuli were housed in an automated recirculation system (aquaneering, san diego, usa), supplied by deionized water, and supplemented with pro reef salt (tropic marin, wartenberg, germany) and nahco 3 to maintain conductivity at 700–800 μs and ph between 7.2—7.4. adults and larvae were held in the same room under a 14:10 h light–dark cycle (light on between 8 am and 10 pm) and at temperature of 27–28 °c. starting from 6 days post-fertilization (dpf), fish were moved from the incubator to the system and fed three times per day with age-appropriate granulated fry food (zm-100, zm-200, zm-300, zm systems, winchester, uk) and brine shrimp nauplii ( artemia salina , zm fish foods, winchester, uk) from 10 dpf. adult fish were fed brine shrimp nauplii once a day and granular pellets (zm fish food, winchester, uk) twice a day. zebrafish were held at a density of approximately 30 embryos per petri dish during 0—5 dpf, 10 fish per litre during larval period [6—21 dpf], and 3–5 fish per litre as juveniles and adults. larval experimental work took place at 5 dpf or at 21 dpf, and all larvae were experimentally naïve. adult behavioural testing and cortisol sampling was done at 6-months of age. sample sizes were based on existing zebrafish behavioural studies of appropriate ages and our previous work [ 57 , 64 , 91 ]. a total of 672 experimental 5 dpf fish were used, 140 experimental fish (and 40 ab fish as social stimuli) were used for social preference testing at 21 dpf. also, 66 experimental fish (with 20 ab fish as social stimuli) were employed for adult behavioural tasks and 12 fish were used for cortisol analysis. adult experimental and stimuli fish and 21 dpf stimuli fish were re-used for other purposes (brood stock, social stimuli, other pilot work, etc.). an overview of the experimental protocol and example behavioural tracks are illustrated in fig. 1 . fig. 1 schematic representation of the experimental protocol at 5 days post-fertilization (dpf), 21 dpf, and 6-months old adult fish. experiments done at the three ages are separated and denoted with purple outline. blue arrows show timeline of procedures while orange dotted lines represent virtual division of testing arenas into relevant areas. for 5 dpf larval fish ( a ), general locomotion was observed during a baseline period, followed by ptz-induced hyperlocomotion. representative examples of behavioural traces are provided to illustrate typical locomotion (wells a1 and b2), immobility (well b1), and hyperlocomotion (well a2). for 21 dpf fish ( b ), three traces illustrate preference (top), indifference (middle), and aversion (bottom) to social stimuli. the dotted orange lines mark the social and non-social zone used for calculation of social preference index [spi]. for adult fish, the dotted orange lines indicate the line between border and center during ( c ) baseline open field testing, five zones during social preference testing ( d ) with zone 1 being closest to the shoal [social zone] and zone 5 being the furthest away from the shoal during social behavioural testing, and the division of water column into vertical top, middle and bottom areas ( e ) during novel tank diving test. representative traces below show bottom-dwelling vs. exploration in higher water column in the open-field, no preference vs. social preference during the social behaviour test, and exploration of bottom only, middle, and top areas of the novel tank. after the behavioural testing, all fish were ( f ) fin-clipped under anaesthesia for genotyping. separate group of experimentally naïve adult fish were used to measure whole-body cortisol levels ( g ) using enzyme immunoassay full size image ethical considerations experiments adhered strictly to a study protocol approved by the local animal ethics committee in gothenburg and followed the animal use and care guidelines of the swedish national board for laboratory animals (ethical permit # 5.8.18–08496/2018) and european directive 2010/63/eu. experiments were planned as per prepare guidelines (norecopa: norway's national consensus platform for the advancement of "the 3 rs") and data are reported here according to the arrive guidelines from the national centre for the replacement, refinement & reduction of animals in research of uk. mecp2 −/− zebrafish line maintenance and genotyping the previously described mecp2 −/− zebrafish line carrying mecp2 q63x mutation in a nacre background was used [ 64 ] as well as mecp2 +/+ siblings from the same parents. prior to this experimental work, this line had been appropriately outcrossed to ensure removal of any potential unintended mutations typically associated with enu-mutagenesis [ 64 ]. larvae from both heterozygous and homozygous crosses were used in experiments. heterozygous parents [ mecp2 +/− paired with mecp2 +/− ] generated offspring with all three genotypes while homozygous pairs ( mecp2 +/+ males bred with mecp2 +/+ females; mecp2 −/− males with mecp2 −/− females) generated only homozygous offspring genotypes. homozygous mecp2 -null parents [ mecp2 −/− x mecp2 −/− ] were used for in-crosses specifically to check for any confounding influence of maternally deposited wildtype mecp2 transcripts or mecp2 protein from heterozygous parents. age-matched wildtype ab zebrafish were raised to be used as stimuli animals for the social experiments. after the behavioural testing was performed as described below, all experimental 5 dpf and 21 dpf larvae were euthanized and adult fish were anesthetized and fin-clipped using age-appropriate ms-222 concentrations. larval fish and fin samples were sent to lgc service lab, uk for genotyping by kompetitive allele-specific pcr (kasp) for all experiments (except for the cortisol experiments, genotyping pcr for those were done in-house, as described before [ 64 ]. pentylenetetrazole (ptz) preparation and exposure, and locomotion assay for 5 dpf fish larval zebrafish of 5 dpf were used to examine if the mecp2 q63x fish showed a different locomotor response after treatment with ptz, compared to controls. the larvae were placed in 48-well plates with 1.6 ml of system water in each well. their behaviour was then recorded for 30 min to serve as a baseline, using a video camera (sony handycam hdr-cx405) mounted above the well plate. ptz stock solution (200 mm) was prepared on the same day as experimental testing was performed by dissolving ptz (sigma-aldrich) in milli-q water. the stock solution was diluted into the system water to get additional ptz-stocks and 0.5 ml of appropriate solutions were mixed with system water of the wells to get desired final concentrations [0, 1, 2.5, 5, 7.5, and 10 mm]. the final concentrations used were well-established and based on prior zebrafish studies that showed hyperlocomotion and induction of seizures (stage i and ii) in larval zebrafish [ 92 ]. following addition of ptz, behaviour during ptz exposure was recorded 30 min. immediately after the experiments, the animals were euthanized in 300 mg/l ms-222 solution, placed in individual pcr tubes on dry ice, and stored at −80 degrees until sent for kasp genotyping (see above). recorded videos of baseline and ptz-treated behaviour were analyzed offline using automated tracking functions of ethovision (noldus information technology, wageningen, netherlands) software. larval social behaviour assay for 21 dpf fish larval zebrafish of 21 dpf were used to investigate if young mecp2 q63x fish displayed different social preferences compared to controls, at the time-point when social behaviour first becomes observable. the social preference of mecp2 +/+ , mecp2 +/− and mecp2 −/− zebrafish larvae was examined by placing them individually in a u-shaped test arena (3.5 × 4.5 cm) with a transparent glass bottom, as previously described [ 57 , 91 ], placed on top of a light table and filmed from above using a video camera (sony handycam hdr-cx405). the test arenas had at each end a squared stimulus chamber which was separated from the test chamber by a wall of transparent glass. the stimulation chambers could be visually shielded from the test chamber by blinders made of opaque white plastic [ 57 , 91 ]. the experiment started when the experimental fish were placed in the test chamber, visually shielded by blinders from the social stimulus, which consisted of one ab fish of the same age. in each experiment 16–18 test fish were run in parallel, in test chambers that were visually separated [i.e., test fish could not see other test fish, stimuli, or the experimenters]. fish were recorded for 20 min during baseline open-exploration, and for 20 min after the opaque blinders were removed and social stimulus was visibly available. recorded videos of behaviour during baseline and social-stimulus conditions were analyzed offline using ethovision (noldus) automated tracking. a social preference index (spi) was calculated; the time spent in the non-social zone was subtracted from the time spent in the social zone and the result was divided by the total time [ 57 , 91 ]. fish (n = 3) that remained frozen for more than 50% of the time or did not enter both social and non-social zones during the baseline period were excluded from the analysis. open field test for adult fish the open field behaviour was observed in the baseline period of the first 10 min of the 6-months old adult social behaviour assay (described below) as adult mecp2 + / + and mecp2 −/− swim freely. the experimental set-up was comprised of one large test tank (60 cm × 30 cm), and two smaller side tanks (15 cm × 30 cm) that were positioned at the short ends of the test tank [ 91 ]. the water depth was 10 cm in both the test tank and in each of the side tanks. tank water was made daily from deionized water and salts (meersalt from tropic marin) and was ph and salinity adjusted to match the conditions of the home-tanks. the set-up was filmed from above using a video camera. experimental tanks were visually isolated from surroundings and the experimenters using black non-transparent plastic sheets; additionally with opaque blinders ensuring that the test tank was visually isolated from the side tanks containing social stimuli fish during the baseline period [10 min]. to measure thigmotaxis behaviour from the recorded movies, a periphery zone was defined as a 5 cm distance from sides of the tank, leaving a 50 × 20 cm center zone in the middle of the chamber. fish were tested individually, and the time spent in the defined periphery and center zones, along with total distances swam during the 10 min were quantified and compared between genotypes. recorded videos were analyzed offline using topscan behaviour analysis system (cleversys inc., reston, virginia, usa) software. social behaviour assay for adult fish adult zebrafish were used to examine if mecp2 −/− fish exhibited atypical social response compared to control mecp2 + / + fish in adulthood. the stimulus shoal consisting of four age-matched ab fish was placed in one of the two side tanks whilst the second tank remained empty, and the shoal side was counterbalanced during trials. for the data analysis in topscan behaviour analysis system, the bottom of the test tank was virtually divided into five equally sized horizontal zones. the zone closest to the shoal was zone one [social zone] with zone five being the furthest away from the shoal. the focal fish was first exposed to the social behaviour test (25 min duration, i.e., 10 min baseline period and 15 min with social stimuli), then it was gently netted to the novel tank diving set up. novel tank diving test for adult fish a subset of adult zebrafish was used to investigate if mecp2 −/− fish exhibited anxiety-like behaviour in response to a new environment compared to controls. the novel tank diving paradigm used one 1.5 l trapezoidal test tank, measuring 15 cm height × 27 cm top × 23.5 cm bottom × 6 cm width. tank water ph and salinity was adjusted to match the conditions of the home-tanks. the experiment was recorded by a side-view camera for 20 min, using the program debut video capture software. recorded videos were analysed offline using topscan analysis system. during analysis, the test tank was virtually divided into 3 vertical zones, to denote top, middle, and bottom areas of the tank. at the end of the experimental day, a fin clip was taken from each fish during anesthesia with 164 mg/l ms-222 for genotyping. post-clipping fish were kept individually in separate tanks for 24 h before returning to their home tank, and then used as brood stock once fins were healed. cortisol sampling and extraction in adult fish whole-body cortisol levels were measured from mixed-sex and equally-sized zebrafish that were experimentally naïve and left undisturbed prior to sampling. cortisol was extracted in three independent experiments from six adult mecp2 −/− and six control mecp2 +/+ zebrafish as described previously [ 93 ].cortisol was extracted in three independent experiments from six adult mecp2 −/− and six control mecp2 +/+ zebrafish as described previously [ 93 ]. briefly, each body sample was collected, weighed, and then dissected on ice into sections for homogenization. each sample was mixed with 5.0 ml of diethyl ether, vortexed for 1 min, and centrifuged at 3500 rpm for 5 min. once the ether was evaporated, the lipid cortisol residue was reconstituted in 1.0 ml of pbs. the extract was assayed for cortisol following manufacturer’s guidelines for high-sensitivity salivary cortisol enzyme immunoassay kit (salimetrics, pa, usa < catalogue no. 1–3002). samples, standards, and controls were run in triplicates and reaction intensity was measured using a plate reader. cortisol calculations (ng/g) were standardized to body weight and buffer volume for individual fish. statistics and data analysis larval and juvenile behaviour videos were tracked using offline automated functions in ethovision xt version 14 (noldus) software while the adult behaviour videos were tracked using topscan (cleversys) offline automated tracking. statistical analyses were performed using ibm spss statistics version 25 and group differences were considered significant when p < 0.05. generally, after considering normality and homogeneity of variances, hypothesis testing on multiple group experimental design experiments was done using linear models (anovas or wilcoxon/kruskal–wallis tests) followed by suitable post-hoc contrasts if appropriate. data were analyzed for main effects of genotype and ptz-concentration [between-subject factors] and time [before and after ptz-treatment or social stimulus as within-subject factor] as appropriate. two-way anovas were used for evaluation of effects of genotype and breeding [homozygous vs heterozygous parents], followed by tukey’s multiple comparisons tests. repeated measure anovas were used for comparisons of mean values from multiple groups or time points. unpaired or nested t-tests were used for comparisons of mean values from two genotype groups, as appropriate. if a main effect or interaction was found, post-hoc tests (t-tests, one-way anovas, or dunn's multiple comparisons test) were carried out for direction of effect, as applicable. as sex cannot be determined in larval fish at 5 dpf and 21 dpf, we examined only adult data for any potential sex differences, and when no sex-effects existed, male and female data were pooled together for analysis. to test null-hypotheses regarding differences between mecp2 +/+ and mecp2 −/− fish, we acknowledge well-established and reproducible main effects of time/habituation and ptz concentrations briefly and focused primarily on reporting only main effects of genotype and all significant interactions involving genotype. results five dpf mecp2 −/− fish displayed hypolocomotion, but no difference in ptz-induced hyperlocomotion locomotion of 5 dpf larvae was tested in two sets of fish, offspring from homozygous parents ( mecp2 +/+ males bred with mecp2 +/+ females; mecp2 −/− males with mecp2 −/− females; resulting in only two homozygous genotypes) and from heterozygous parents ( mecp2 +/− x mecp2 +/− ; resulting in all three genotypes). homozygous in-crosses control for any confounding effects of maternally deposited wildtype mecp2 transcripts but has a drawback of comparing non-siblings. conversely, siblings from heterozygous crosses provide control for any clutch/family differences but all embryos acquire maternally deposited mecp2 [ 63 ]. when testing 5 dpf larvae from homozygous breeding, we found mecp2 −/− fish moved significantly less (fig. 2 a; t = 6.142, df = 318, p < 0.0001) than mecp2 +/+ fish, and although five gradually higher concentrations of ptz (0, 1, 2.5, 5, 7.5, 10 mm) increased locomotion in a dose-dependent way (p < 0.05, for main effect of ptz), there were no differences between mecp2 +/+ and mecp2 −/− fish in ptz-induced hyperlocomotion (fig. 2 b; p > 0.05, for all ptz concentrations). likewise, the mecp2 −/− fish from heterozygous parents also moved shorter distances (fig. 2 c; t = 2.448, df = 156, p = 0.016) before ptz-treatment compared to their mecp2 + / + siblings, and these fish were comparable to fish from homozygous crosses. while ptz (control and two concentrations: 0, 5, and 10 mm) increased locomotion (fig. 2 d; p < 0.05, for main effect of ptz) in all 5 dpf sibling larvae from heterozygous parents, there were no main effects of genotype on ptz-induced hyperlocomotion (fig. 2 d; p < 0.05). statistically significant differences in movement within genotypes between baseline and ptz-treatment are presented in table 2 . overall, these results show that mecp2 −/− zebrafish at 5 dpf, from both homozygous and heterozygous crosses, displayed hypolocomotion at baseline but reacted similarly to ptz treatment as compared to the control groups. fig. 2 larval locomotion behaviour was similarly affected in mecp2 −/− fish bred from homozygous parents (top panel) and heterozygous parents (bottom panel). a baseline locomotion prior to ptz-treatment for 5 dpf larvae from homozygous breeding showed that mecp2 −/− (n = 117) larvae moved significantly shorter distances than mecp2 + / + (n = 203). b distances moved by mecp2 + / + (blue; n = 33–35) and mecp2 −/− (red; n = 19–20) fish from homozygous parents were similar during baseline (20 min before; lighter colours) and showed similar increases during ptz-treatment (20 min, darker colours). c baseline locomotion prior to ptz-treatment for 5 dpf larvae from heterozygous mecp2 +/− crosses showed that mecp2 −/− (n = 68) larvae moved significantly shorter distances than mecp2 + / + (n = 90). d the distances moved were similar during baseline (20 min before; lighter colours) and the hyperlocomotion during ptz-treatment (20 min, darker colours) was also similar in 5 dpf mecp2 + / + , mecp2 +/− , and mecp2 + / + fish derived from heterozygous breeding. sample sizes were mecp2 + / + (blue; n = 41–65), mecp2 +/− (purple; n = 86–90) and mecp2 −/− (red; n = 35–37). significant effects of ptz-treatment within genotypes are indicated in grey. ****p < 0.0001 and *p < 0.05. mean values shown as dotted lines and brackets mark sem (a and c) and bars correspond to mean ± sem (b and d) full size image table 2 within genotype comparisons for movement during baseline and ptz treatment periods for various concentration full size table mecp2 −/− zebrafish larvae do not display altered social preference at 21 dpf to determine any effects of mecp2 null-mutation on social preference and locomotion in three-week old fish, mecp2 −/− and mecp2 +/− zebrafish were compared to wildtype mecp2 + / + siblings from heterozygous breeding during baseline and social phases. the spi distributions for social phase were not normal and non-parametric tests were used for determining the effect of genotype and visual social access. as illustrated in fig. 3 a, kruskal–wallis tests showed no main effect of genotype during baseline (p = 0.702) and social (0.922) phases. wilcoxon signed rank test revealed that heterozygous mecp2 +/− fish (p < 0.001) showed significantly stronger bias for the zone adjacent to social stimulus (p = 0.140 for mecp2 +/+ ; p = 0.0816 for mecp2 −/− ). fig. 3 social preference index, time spent in the social zone, and total distance moved by 21 dpf zebrafish during baseline and social stimulus phases. social preference ( a ) was not altered in mecp2 (n = 77) or mecp2 −/− (n = 37) larvae compared to mecp2 + / + (n = 23) zebrafish. additionally, sibling zebrafish of all three genotypes spent similar length of time in the social zone ( b ) and swam similar distances ( c ) during the baseline and stimulus phases of the experiment. ****p < 0.0001 ***p < 0.001 **p < 0.01 and *p < 0.05. mean ± sem full size image we also compared time spent in social zone separately as well and all three groups displayed stronger bias towards social zone in the social phase of the test. no main effect of genotype was detected (fig. 3 b; p > 0.05 for both baseline and social phase; kruskal–wallis test) and significantly more time was spent in the adjacent social zone during visual social access by for mecp2 +/+ , mecp2 +/− , and mecp2 −/− (fig. 3 b; p = 0.009, p < 0.0001, and p < 0.0001, respectively; wilcoxon signed ranks tests). lastly, we analyzed total distances moved during baseline and social phases of the social preference test and a repeated-measures anova showed a significant decrease in overall movement during visual access to social stimulus (fig. 3 c; f (1,132) = 24.735, p < 0.001) but no main effect or interaction of genotype on distances moved. overall, zebrafish at 21 dpf displayed similar levels of locomotion and social preference regardless of their mecp2 genotype. anxiety behaviours in adult mecp2 −/− fish were affected but not open-field locomotion to get a better understanding of movement and anxiety-related behaviours in adult mecp2 −/− fish, responses of 6-months old adult mecp2 −/− and mecp2 + / + fish individually placed in a large open-field were observed. both genotype groups displayed similar locomotion and there was no main effect of genotype on total distances moved (fig. 4 a; p > 0.05; t-test). for analysis of thigmotaxis (wall-hugging) behaviour in adult mecp2 −/− fish, we also examined time spent in center vs. periphery of the testing tank. there was a main effect of genotype (fig. 4 b; t = 2.026, df = 64, p = 0.047) confirming that overall mecp2 −/− fish spent less time in the center zone during undisturbed observation. as indicated in fig. 4 c, all fish spent progressively more time in the center during the baseline, with male mecp2 −/− fish showed less thigmotaxis compared to female mecp2 −/− fish, and repeated-measures anova showed a time x sex x genotype interaction (f (9, 558) = 3.418, p = 0.0004) and a significant effect of time (f (9, 558) = 20.98, p < 0.0001), but there were no main effects of genotype or sex for time spent in periphery. thus, adult zebrafish displayed similar levels of locomotion regardless of their mecp2 genotype whereas the mecp2 −/− fish displayed less time in the center zone indicating increased anxiety-like response compared to controls. fig. 4 anxiety-related behaviours and whole-body cortisol levels were altered in adult mecp2 −/− fish while locomotion and social preference were unaffected. locomotion in the open-field ( a ) was not affected but adult mecp2 −/− fish spend significantly less time in the ( b ) centre zone in the open field compared to the mecp2 + / + group and ( c ) male mecp2 −/− fish showed somewhat less time in the periphery, compared to female mecp2 −/− fish. during the presentation of social stimuli, time spent in the social zone ( d ) was not significantly different in adult mecp2 −/− (n = 43) as compared to mecp2 + / + (n = 22). while mecp2 −/− fish generally trended towards more time closer to social stimuli than mecp2 + / + fish across the 15 min ( e ) the spi was not different between the two groups of fish (f ). in a novel tank diving task, the mecp2 −/− (n = 22) zebrafish made less bottom-to-middle transitions ( g ) and spent less time in high-mobility state ( h ) and more time in the immobile state (i) as compared to mecp2 +/+ (n = 10) indicating an increase in bottom-dwelling and freezing behaviours, but overall time spent in bottom, middle, and top areas ( j ) was not different between the two genotypes. baseline cortisol levels ( k ) were higher in experimentally naïve mecp2 −/− (n = 6) fish compared to mecp2 + / + (n = 6) zebrafish. *p < 0.05 and ****p < 0.0001. mean ± sem full size image mecp2 −/− zebrafish do not display altered social preference in adulthood both genotypes responded to social stimuli and spent similar length of time in the social zone when exposed to the conspecific shoals. we compared total time spent in social zone, time across the 15 min of social stimuli availability, and spi, and found no differences between adult mecp2 −/− and mecp2 + / + (fig. 4 d, e, f; p > 0.05; t-tests). overall, parallel to three-week-old zebrafish, adult fish also displayed similar levels of social preference regardless of their mecp2 genotype. adult mecp2 −/− zebrafish display increased anxiety behaviour in a novel tank in the novel tank diving paradigm, we found a reduction in the number of bottom-to-middle transitions made by the mecp2 −/− fish (fig. 4 g; t = 2.080, df = 30, p = 0.0461). we also found that the duration of time in high mobility state was significantly reduced (fig. 4 h; t = 2.502, df = 30, p = 0.0181) and time being immobile was significantly increased (fig. 4 i; t = 2.093, df = 30, p = 0.0449) in the mecp2 −/− group compared to the mecp2 +/+ fish, even while time spent in bottom, middle, and top sections of the novel tank did not differ between the genotypes (fig. 4 j; t = 0.0014, df = 4, p = 0.994; nested t-test). taken together, these results indicate that adult mecp2 −/− zebrafish displayed elevated levels of anxiety behaviours, such as bottom-dwelling and freezing. adult mecp2 −/− zebrafish have higher cortisol levels lacking functional mecp2 affected resting whole-body cortisol levels in experimentally naïve unstressed fish. compared to mecp2 +/+ fish, similarly sized mecp2 −/− fish had higher cortisol levels (fig. 4 k; t = 6.512, df = 10, p < 0.0001) in their bodies. thus, cortisol levels were elevated in adult mecp2 −/− zebrafish compared to controls. discussion in the current study of the zebrafish mecp2 gene, we replicated the previous finding that mecp2 q63x zebrafish larvae exhibit hypolocomotion compared to mecp2 + / + fish [ 64 ]. our results also revealed that the gaba a receptor antagonist ptz induced hyperlocomotion similarly in mecp2 −/− , mecp2 +/− , and mecp2 + / + siblings. to our knowledge, this is the first analysis of social and anxiety behaviour and cortisol levels of adult mecp2 q63x zebrafish. we found that mecp2 −/− zebrafish moved less and displayed higher anxiety behaviours and higher cortisol levels compared to mecp2 + / + fish. interestingly, our results also revealed that mecp2 −/− fish showed similar social preference as mecp2 + / + , both during ontogeny of social behaviour at 21 dpf larvae and as mature form of adulthood socialization. recently, several zebrafish mutant lines lacking genes linked to neurodevelopmental disorders have shown phenotypic seizure-like behaviour [ 92 , 94 – 97 ], social dysfunction [ 86 , 98 , 99 ] and locomotion abnormalities as well as changes in activity and morphology of relevant brain regions [ 96 , 100 ]. previously, zebrafish mecp2 gene manipulation studies have showed recapitulation of milder rett syndrome phenotypes in mutants and morphants, such as motor abnormalities and changes in larval anxiety behaviour [ 64 ] and transcriptomic and proteomic analyses have suggested impaired visual function and energy metabolism in mecp2 q63x fish [ 66 , 67 ]. exposure to genotoxic and environmental regulators such as morphine [ 77 ], alcohol [ 69 ], chronic bpa [ 74 ], crude oil and lead [ 75 ] have also been shown to regulate mecp2 expression and mecp2 function in zebrafish. altogether, these studies have further increased value of zebrafish models of rett syndrome and provided additional impetus to characterize motor, social, stress, and anxiety-like behaviour in developmental and adult mecp2 q63x fish. locomotion profile of mecp2 q63x fish similar to the current study, previously loss-of-function of mecp2 has been reported to cause hypolocomotion in 5–6 dpf larval zebrafish [ 64 ]. furthermore, morpholino-mediated knockdown of mecp2 led to a decrease in motor activity as early as 28 hpf in zebrafish morphants [ 78 ]. the hypolocomotion phenotype in larval zebrafish was suggested to be caused by an increase in abnormal axonal branches of caudal primary motor neurons [ 78 ] whereas selective activation of cholinergic neurotransmission reversed the locomotor impairment in mice [ 101 ]. while we did not find any differences in locomotion of adult mecp2 −/− and mecp2 + / + fish in the open-field, higher levels of freezing and bottom-dwelling were seen in the novel tank test of adult mecp2 −/− fish. here it is relevant to note that using the same null-mutation model and proteomics, impairments in energy metabolism, redox balance, and structure and function of cardiac and skeletal muscle in larval and adult fish have been suggested [ 66 ]. while our tests induced some anxiety for short durations, evaluation of mecp2 −/− fish in longer and more exhaustive motor tasks requiring more energy expenditure and higher muscle performance would shed light on behavioural consequences of altered proteomes. stress and anxiety-related behaviours in mecp2 q63x fish the elevated anxiety behaviour and higher cortisol levels observed in the mecp2 q63x zebrafish are of interest as these mimic frequently displayed heightened anxiety and mood fluctuation symptoms [ 10 , 11 , 19 , 23 , 24 ] and related aberrant hpa-axis function in rett syndrome patients, including increased cortisol levels [ 19 , 21 – 23 ]. also, mouse mecp2 has been reported to regulate stress vulnerability [ 46 ] and key genes in the hpa axis [ 47 , 102 , 103 ], and mice with truncated mecp2 allele have increased expression of corticotropin-releasing hormone and elevated levels of corticosterone in response to stress [ 104 ]. we purposely tested baseline cortisol levels in experimentally naïve fish as novel environments and handling during behavioural procedures can induce stress and led to changes in whole-body cortisol. while circulating levels of cortisol and corticosterone oscillate with circadian clock of the body and do not have a one-to-one relationship with psychological stress [ 105 ], higher resting cortisol levels observed in the mecp2 q63x mutant fish provide evidence of altered stress function linked to mecp2 null-mutation. future mecp2 q63x zebrafish studies with comparison of cortisol levels in resting and induced acute and chronic stress conditions, along with pharmacological treatments with anxiolytics and antidepressants would be valuable in further clarification of links between mecp2 deficiency and aberrant hpa-axis function in rett syndrome patients. in line with our results, mecp2 knockout mice have been reported to display increased anxiety-like behaviours [ 101 , 104 , 106 ], whereas stearns et al. [ 107 ] found decreased anxiety-like behaviour in mutant mecp2 mice and samaco et al. [ 47 ] showed that overexpression of mecp2 also increases anxiety-related behaviours in mice. thus, investigations of anxiety-related behaviours in animal models of rett syndrome have so far yielded some inconsistent findings across as well as within species, but the association with increased stress vulnerability and atypical stress responsiveness are fairly established. also, whereas we here show elevated anxiety when comparing adult mecp2 -/- zebrafish with mecp2 +/+ fish of the same age, a previous study doing the same comparison of 6 dpf zebrafish, carrying the same null-mutation, instead showed decreased anxiety [assessed using thigmotaxis or wall-hugging] [ 64 ]. these results, along with the locomotion findings, demonstrate distinct effects of mecp2 deletion in young and adult zebrafish, indicating that mecp2 may regulate behaviours differently during early development and adulthood. vision-based social behaviour in mecp2 q63x fish in contrast to patients with rett syndrome and mammalian models lacking functional mecp2, our investigations did not reveal any substantial role of mecp2 in the expression of social preference behaviour of 21 dpf mecp2 −/− larvae and adult mecp2 −/− fish. adult mecp2 knockout mice display a hypersocial phenotype in several studies whereas juvenile play behaviour was reduced in female rats [ 32 ]. aside from heightened anxiety mentioned above, the lack of differences in our social phenotype could also be a consequence of using behavioural tests that did not provide enough motivation or complexity of social interaction (for example, we used only one fish as social stimulus vs empty space for pfd 15 and visual-only access to a group of four conspecifics for adult fish). more stimulating social testing conditions may potentially disclose functional regulation of social behaviour by mecp2 in zebrafish, such as larger shoals, isolation-induced social behaviour, interactive shoaling with live conspecifics fish where test fish would swim in a group, or social buffering during stress, etc., and higher complexity of social interaction (such as social memory or recognition, and dyadic interactions seen during aggression or mating). nonetheless, the responses to vision-based social stimuli and novel environments in our study further suggest either no effects of lacking mecp2 on vision or compensation by additional factors in older 21 dpf and adult fish observed. future studies examining vision directly using higher-resolution observations and comprehensive investigations of shoaling, mating, and dyadic aggression dynamics in zebrafish mecp2 q63x fish will help elucidate these interactions. limitations a large number of patients with rett syndrome have intellectual disability and seizures. an obvious limitation of the current study is lack of cognitive evaluation of mecp2 q63x fish and future zebrafish studies using this model and other mecp2 manipulations should assess cognitive abilities in combination with social, motor and anxiety-like behaviours. our results indicated that pharmacological inhibition of gaba receptors induced a hyperlocomotion response similarly in all fish independently of the presence of the mecp2 protein. in contrast, mecp2 knockout mice display cortical discharges consistent with absence epilepsy [ 108 ] and loss of mecp2 specifically from forebrain excitatory neurons leads to cortical hyperexcitation and seizures [ 109 ], leading to suggestion of alterations of the balance between the excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission. thus, despite our finding, to fully exclude that mecp2 exert action on gaba signalling, and to explore any effects on glutamatergic functioning, future zebrafish studies should include alternative convulsants and electrophysiological recordings across development. considering the apparent and devastating deficits seen in humans carrying deficient mecp2, the lack of phenotypical differences in sociability and ptz-induced hyperlocomotion between mecp2 −/− and mecp2 + / + zebrafish are noticeable. our methodology does not allow distinction between seizure stages and thus well-established hypolocomotion in mecp2 −/− fish could mask ptz-induced changes. more comprehensive studies with electrophysiology and higher resolution observations are needed to confirm if the hypolocomotion is concealing the seizure-like activity or if the typical locomotion in ptz-treated mecp2 −/− larvae could be due to other factors (motivation, energy, etc.). taking in consideration the variability of symptoms seen in patients with rett syndrome, we cannot rule out the possibility that behavioural variations may exist at specific or later stages of zebrafish development—as seen in other animal models of the syndrome [ 110 ]. lastly, a caveat of using zebrafish models is that unlike humans, the zebrafish mecp2 gene is not on x-chromosome and sex determination in zebrafish is not influenced by sex chromosomes, but rather autosomal chromosomes and environmental factors play important roles. thus, while viable and fertile mecp2 −/− fish of both sexes can be studied, translation value of conclusions from zebrafish studies alone may be limited. conclusion dysfunction of mecp2, a protein vital for neuronal maturation and silencing of genes during growth and experience-dependent changes, is linked to rett syndrome, autism and other neurodevelopmental disorders. using a zebrafish model, we studied behaviour of young and adult zebrafish that lacked this protein and discovered that these fish mimic milder human symptoms of atypical movement and elevated anxiety, but overall vision and social behaviour were unaffected. in conclusion, the current study showed that zebrafish mecp2 modulates locomotion and anxiety but not sociability or ptz-induced hyperlocomotion. while this is the first study to explore adult behaviour in mecp2 −/− zebrafish, we have essentially raised more questions than answered. consequently, there is an urgent necessity to complement the existing enu-derived and tilling-selected line used in our experiments and create targeted mutant zebrafish models with greater precision. conditional mutants that reduce or eradicate mecp2 function at specific developmental timepoints or in specific brain areas and neuron-types during notable experiences (such as socialization or when exposed to stressful stimuli) can further help elucidate how experience-dependent neuronal changes are regulated by zebrafish mecp2. zebrafish research has grown exponentially with advancements in gene editing techniques, such as crispr-mediated base- and prime-editing, rna-editing, and combining brain-specific manipulation of mecp2 with high-throughput studies can make understanding of mecp2 function and potential therapeutic developments more feasible. availability of data and materials the datasets generated during and/or analysed during the current study and any

in the current study of the zebrafish mecp2 gene, we replicated the previous finding that mecp2 q63x zebrafish larvae exhibit hypolocomotion compared to mecp2 + / + fish [ 64 ]. our results also revealed that the gaba a receptor antagonist ptz induced hyperlocomotion similarly in mecp2 −/− , mecp2 +/− , and mecp2 + / + siblings. to our knowledge, this is the first analysis of social and anxiety behaviour and cortisol levels of adult mecp2 q63x zebrafish. we found that mecp2 −/− zebrafish moved less and displayed higher anxiety behaviours and higher cortisol levels compared to mecp2 + / + fish. interestingly, our results also revealed that mecp2 −/− fish showed similar social preference as mecp2 + / + , both during ontogeny of social behaviour at 21 dpf larvae and as mature form of adulthood socialization. recently, several zebrafish mutant lines lacking genes linked to neurodevelopmental disorders have shown phenotypic seizure-like behaviour [ 92 , 94 – 97 ], social dysfunction [ 86 , 98 , 99 ] and locomotion abnormalities as well as changes in activity and morphology of relevant brain regions [ 96 , 100 ]. previously, zebrafish mecp2 gene manipulation studies have showed recapitulation of milder rett syndrome phenotypes in mutants and morphants, such as motor abnormalities and changes in larval anxiety behaviour [ 64 ] and transcriptomic and proteomic analyses have suggested impaired visual function and energy metabolism in mecp2 q63x fish [ 66 , 67 ]. exposure to genotoxic and environmental regulators such as morphine [ 77 ], alcohol [ 69 ], chronic bpa [ 74 ], crude oil and lead [ 75 ] have also been shown to regulate mecp2 expression and mecp2 function in zebrafish. altogether, these studies have further increased value of zebrafish models of rett syndrome and provided additional impetus to characterize motor, social, stress, and anxiety-like behaviour in developmental and adult mecp2 q63x fish. locomotion profile of mecp2 q63x fish similar to the current study, previously loss-of-function of mecp2 has been reported to cause hypolocomotion in 5–6 dpf larval zebrafish [ 64 ]. furthermore, morpholino-mediated knockdown of mecp2 led to a decrease in motor activity as early as 28 hpf in zebrafish morphants [ 78 ]. the hypolocomotion phenotype in larval zebrafish was suggested to be caused by an increase in abnormal axonal branches of caudal primary motor neurons [ 78 ] whereas selective activation of cholinergic neurotransmission reversed the locomotor impairment in mice [ 101 ]. while we did not find any differences in locomotion of adult mecp2 −/− and mecp2 + / + fish in the open-field, higher levels of freezing and bottom-dwelling were seen in the novel tank test of adult mecp2 −/− fish. here it is relevant to note that using the same null-mutation model and proteomics, impairments in energy metabolism, redox balance, and structure and function of cardiac and skeletal muscle in larval and adult fish have been suggested [ 66 ]. while our tests induced some anxiety for short durations, evaluation of mecp2 −/− fish in longer and more exhaustive motor tasks requiring more energy expenditure and higher muscle performance would shed light on behavioural consequences of altered proteomes. stress and anxiety-related behaviours in mecp2 q63x fish the elevated anxiety behaviour and higher cortisol levels observed in the mecp2 q63x zebrafish are of interest as these mimic frequently displayed heightened anxiety and mood fluctuation symptoms [ 10 , 11 , 19 , 23 , 24 ] and related aberrant hpa-axis function in rett syndrome patients, including increased cortisol levels [ 19 , 21 – 23 ]. also, mouse mecp2 has been reported to regulate stress vulnerability [ 46 ] and key genes in the hpa axis [ 47 , 102 , 103 ], and mice with truncated mecp2 allele have increased expression of corticotropin-releasing hormone and elevated levels of corticosterone in response to stress [ 104 ]. we purposely tested baseline cortisol levels in experimentally naïve fish as novel environments and handling during behavioural procedures can induce stress and led to changes in whole-body cortisol. while circulating levels of cortisol and corticosterone oscillate with circadian clock of the body and do not have a one-to-one relationship with psychological stress [ 105 ], higher resting cortisol levels observed in the mecp2 q63x mutant fish provide evidence of altered stress function linked to mecp2 null-mutation. future mecp2 q63x zebrafish studies with comparison of cortisol levels in resting and induced acute and chronic stress conditions, along with pharmacological treatments with anxiolytics and antidepressants would be valuable in further clarification of links between mecp2 deficiency and aberrant hpa-axis function in rett syndrome patients. in line with our results, mecp2 knockout mice have been reported to display increased anxiety-like behaviours [ 101 , 104 , 106 ], whereas stearns et al. [ 107 ] found decreased anxiety-like behaviour in mutant mecp2 mice and samaco et al. [ 47 ] showed that overexpression of mecp2 also increases anxiety-related behaviours in mice. thus, investigations of anxiety-related behaviours in animal models of rett syndrome have so far yielded some inconsistent findings across as well as within species, but the association with increased stress vulnerability and atypical stress responsiveness are fairly established. also, whereas we here show elevated anxiety when comparing adult mecp2 -/- zebrafish with mecp2 +/+ fish of the same age, a previous study doing the same comparison of 6 dpf zebrafish, carrying the same null-mutation, instead showed decreased anxiety [assessed using thigmotaxis or wall-hugging] [ 64 ]. these results, along with the locomotion findings, demonstrate distinct effects of mecp2 deletion in young and adult zebrafish, indicating that mecp2 may regulate behaviours differently during early development and adulthood. vision-based social behaviour in mecp2 q63x fish in contrast to patients with rett syndrome and mammalian models lacking functional mecp2, our investigations did not reveal any substantial role of mecp2 in the expression of social preference behaviour of 21 dpf mecp2 −/− larvae and adult mecp2 −/− fish. adult mecp2 knockout mice display a hypersocial phenotype in several studies whereas juvenile play behaviour was reduced in female rats [ 32 ]. aside from heightened anxiety mentioned above, the lack of differences in our social phenotype could also be a consequence of using behavioural tests that did not provide enough motivation or complexity of social interaction (for example, we used only one fish as social stimulus vs empty space for pfd 15 and visual-only access to a group of four conspecifics for adult fish). more stimulating social testing conditions may potentially disclose functional regulation of social behaviour by mecp2 in zebrafish, such as larger shoals, isolation-induced social behaviour, interactive shoaling with live conspecifics fish where test fish would swim in a group, or social buffering during stress, etc., and higher complexity of social interaction (such as social memory or recognition, and dyadic interactions seen during aggression or mating). nonetheless, the responses to vision-based social stimuli and novel environments in our study further suggest either no effects of lacking mecp2 on vision or compensation by additional factors in older 21 dpf and adult fish observed. future studies examining vision directly using higher-resolution observations and comprehensive investigations of shoaling, mating, and dyadic aggression dynamics in zebrafish mecp2 q63x fish will help elucidate these interactions. limitations a large number of patients with rett syndrome have intellectual disability and seizures. an obvious limitation of the current study is lack of cognitive evaluation of mecp2 q63x fish and future zebrafish studies using this model and other mecp2 manipulations should assess cognitive abilities in combination with social, motor and anxiety-like behaviours. our results indicated that pharmacological inhibition of gaba receptors induced a hyperlocomotion response similarly in all fish independently of the presence of the mecp2 protein. in contrast, mecp2 knockout mice display cortical discharges consistent with absence epilepsy [ 108 ] and loss of mecp2 specifically from forebrain excitatory neurons leads to cortical hyperexcitation and seizures [ 109 ], leading to suggestion of alterations of the balance between the excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission. thus, despite our finding, to fully exclude that mecp2 exert action on gaba signalling, and to explore any effects on glutamatergic functioning, future zebrafish studies should include alternative convulsants and electrophysiological recordings across development. considering the apparent and devastating deficits seen in humans carrying deficient mecp2, the lack of phenotypical differences in sociability and ptz-induced hyperlocomotion between mecp2 −/− and mecp2 + / + zebrafish are noticeable. our methodology does not allow distinction between seizure stages and thus well-established hypolocomotion in mecp2 −/− fish could mask ptz-induced changes. more comprehensive studies with electrophysiology and higher resolution observations are needed to confirm if the hypolocomotion is concealing the seizure-like activity or if the typical locomotion in ptz-treated mecp2 −/− larvae could be due to other factors (motivation, energy, etc.). taking in consideration the variability of symptoms seen in patients with rett syndrome, we cannot rule out the possibility that behavioural variations may exist at specific or later stages of zebrafish development—as seen in other animal models of the syndrome [ 110 ]. lastly, a caveat of using zebrafish models is that unlike humans, the zebrafish mecp2 gene is not on x-chromosome and sex determination in zebrafish is not influenced by sex chromosomes, but rather autosomal chromosomes and environmental factors play important roles. thus, while viable and fertile mecp2 −/− fish of both sexes can be studied, translation value of conclusions from zebrafish studies alone may be limited. conclusion dysfunction of mecp2, a protein vital for neuronal maturation and silencing of genes during growth and experience-dependent changes, is linked to rett syndrome, autism and other neurodevelopmental disorders. using a zebrafish model, we studied behaviour of young and adult zebrafish that lacked this protein and discovered that these fish mimic milder human symptoms of atypical movement and elevated anxiety, but overall vision and social behaviour were unaffected. in conclusion, the current study showed that zebrafish mecp2 modulates locomotion and anxiety but not sociability or ptz-induced hyperlocomotion. while this is the first study to explore adult behaviour in mecp2 −/− zebrafish, we have essentially raised more questions than answered. consequently, there is an urgent necessity to complement the existing enu-derived and tilling-selected line used in our experiments and create targeted mutant zebrafish models with greater precision. conditional mutants that reduce or eradicate mecp2 function at specific developmental timepoints or in specific brain areas and neuron-types during notable experiences (such as socialization or when exposed to stressful stimuli) can further help elucidate how experience-dependent neuronal changes are regulated by zebrafish mecp2. zebrafish research has grown exponentially with advancements in gene editing techniques, such as crispr-mediated base- and prime-editing, rna-editing, and combining brain-specific manipulation of mecp2 with high-throughput studies can make understanding of mecp2 function and potential therapeutic developments more feasible. availability of data and materials the datasets generated during and/or analysed during the current study and any
