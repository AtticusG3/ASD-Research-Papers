## Abstract

Study DesignRetrospective cohort comparative study.ObjectiveTo investigate whether specific upper instrumented vertebra (UIV) pedicle screw characteristics-particularly screw slope (UIV SS), tip-to-endplate distance (TED), and tip-to-anterior cortex distance (TAD)-are associated with the development of upper instrumented vertebra fracture (UIVF) following adult spinal deformity (ASD) surgery.MethodsThis retrospective study included 132 patients (mean age: 68.4 years) who underwent corrective surgery from 2013 to 2022, with a minimum follow-up of 2 years. The radiographic parameters and UIV screw characteristics were analyzed. Patients were categorized into UIVF and non-UIVF groups. Logistic regression and Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve analyses were used to identify the risk factors and cutoff values.ResultsUIVF occurred in 28.8% (38/132) of the patients. Post-thoracic kyphosis (Post-TK) and TED of the upper UIV screw (Post-TED
