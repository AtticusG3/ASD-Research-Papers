# Combined Treatment with Minocycline and an mGluR5 Antagonist Alters Resting EEG Spectral Power, but Not Sound-Evoked Responses, in a Mouse Model of Fragile X Syndrome.

## Abstract

Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) is a leading genetic cause of intellectual disability and autism-like behaviors. Glutamatergic mGluR5 receptors and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) are therapeutic targets to treat FXS, but clinical trials targeting each of these pathways have not been successful. Here, we tested if the electroencephalography (EEG) phenotypes associated with FXS are reversed with a novel combination of treatments affecting the two pathways.
