## Abstract

Dopamine (DA) plays a vital role in mood, alertness, and behavior, with dysregulation linked to disorders such as Parkinson's disease, ADHD, depression, and addiction. In this study, we develop and analyze a reduced mathematical model of dopamine synthesis, release, and reuptake to investigate how daily rhythms influence dopamine dynamics and the efficacy of dopamine reuptake inhibitors (DRIs) used in the treatment of various neuropsychiatric conditions. We simplify a detailed mathematical model of dopamine synthesis, release, and reuptake and demonstrate that our reduced system maintains key dynamical features including homeostatic regulation via autoreceptors. Our model captures core autoregulatory mechanisms and reveals that DRIs can exert substantial time-of-day effects, allowing for dopamine levels to be sustained at elevated levels when administered at circadian troughs. These fluctuations depend sensitively on the timing of DRI administration relative to circadian variations in enzyme activity. We further extend the model to incorporate feedback from local dopaminergic tone, which generates ultradian oscillations in the model independent of circadian regulation. Administration of DRIs lengthens the ultradian periodicity. Our findings provide strong evidence that intrinsic fluctuations in DA should be considered in the clinical use of DRIs, offering a mechanistic framework for improving chronotherapeutic strategies targeting dopaminergic dysfunction.

Many drugs prescribed for neurological or psychiatric conditions influence dopamine metabolism, but their time-of-day effects are not well understood. Using mathematical modeling, we present evidence of time-of-day effects of dopamine reuptake inhibitors like modafinil or bupropion. We find in the model that taking doses at the wrong time of day can cause large spikes and subsequent crashes in dopamine levels, while strategic timing can sustain dopamine levels for much longer. Our model can be used to explore the outcomes of different dose schedules and to inform treatment strategies. In addition, we find that incorporating population-level activity of dopaminergic neurons generates intrinsic, 4-hour ultradian rhythms that are separate from circadian input. Dopamine fluctuates periodically even without a circadian drive, but the underlying mechanisms have not been understood. Our model provides a plausible explanation of dopamine ultradian oscillations as a neuronal population-level phenomenon.Citation:Yao T, Kim R (2025) Mathematical modeling of dopamine rhythms and timing of dopamine reuptake inhibitors.

IntroductionDopamine (DA) levels in the brain fluctuate throughout the day, influencing alertness, mood, and decision-making. DA dysfunction is associated with numerous health issues. A primary characteristic of Parkinson’s disease (PD) is the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra [1–3]. Various drugs of abuse stimulate dopamine release and create drug dependence [4]. Dopamine dysregulation has been linked to depression, schizophrenia, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) [5,6]. These health consequences highlight the importance of dopamine regulation in the brain.Intracellular and extracellular concentrations of dopamine are tightly modulated by autoregulatory feedback mechanisms. In a dopaminergic cell, the enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) converts tyrosine into levodopa, which is then decarboxylated into DA. This intracellular DA is then packaged into vesicles and released into the extracellular space. Dopamine D2 autoreceptors encoded by theDRD2gene inhibit tyrosine hydroxylase activity to regulate synthesis, and the dopamine transporter (DAT) moves excess extracellular DA back into the neuron [7,8]. Mathematical modeling shows that DA homeostasis relies on complex interactions between these mechanisms [9–11].A better understanding of these biochemical pathways may lead to critical health insights.DRD2is significantly associated with sleep disruptions [12] and has been identified as the gene most strongly linked to self-reported tiredness in a genome-wide association study [13]. Gene-set association analyses have identified significant associations between DA-related genes and ADHD, autism spectrum disorder, bipolar disorder, major depression, Tourette’s syndrome, and schizophrenia [14]. Dysregulation of DAT has been implicated in Parkinson’s disease, ADHD, bipolar disorder, and depression [15]. In addition, drugs acting on dopaminergic pathways are commonly prescribed to alleviate symptoms of various health conditions. For example, modafinil inhibits DAT activity, which increases extracellular concentrations of dopamine and promotes wakefulness in individuals experiencing fatigue or excessive daytime sleepiness [16]. Methylphenidate prescribed for ADHD and bupropion used to treat depression, addiction, and seasonal affective disorder (SAD) also act as dopamine reuptake inhibitors (DRIs), a class of drugs that inhibit DAT activity [17].While external stimuli like reward and stress can cause transient changes, endogenous circadian rhythms drive roughly 24-hour periodic behavior in dopamine synthesis, reuptake, and release in individual dopaminergic neurons. In general, dopamine plays an important role in sleep, wakefulness, and other rhythmic processes [18,19]. For example, activation of dopaminergic neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) promotes wakefulness [20], and dopamine signaling in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), the central circadian pacemaker, can phase-shift activity patterns in mice [21,22]. Previous mathematical models [23,24] have been used to investigate the molecular mechanisms that produce circadian rhythms in the dopaminergic system in mammals [25–28], and to study reciprocal phase-shifting effects [29].Many drugs taken for neuropsychiatric or neurodegenerative disease, including DRIs, target proteins or functions known to be regulated by the molecular clock, but circadian timing is not often considered in treatment protocols [30]. There is strong evidence of chronotherapeutic effects of antidepressants in both rodents and humans, with greater efficacy at certain times of the day depending on the drug [31–34]. However, in general, very few experimental or clinical studies have investigated the effects of time of day on drugs targeting neurotransmission. In this paper, we reduce an existing mathematical model of dopamine synthesis, release, and reuptake [9] to four core variables, allowing us to analytically compute equilibria and determine their asymptotic stability; seeFig 1for a model schematic. We demonstrate that the reduced model retains essential dynamics of the full model and use the model to explore time-of-day effects of DRIs targeting the dopaminergic system. We found that the administration time had a substantial impact on the time course of DA, with sustained elevation of DA levels when administered at circadian troughs and large fluctuations when administered at circadian peaks.Download:PPTPowerPoint slidePNGlarger imageTIFForiginal imageFig 1.Schematic diagram of full and reduced mathematical models.(A) Schematic diagram of full model of dopamine synthesis, release, and reuptake by Best et al.

Cytosolic dopamine is then packaged into vesicles (vesicular dopamine,vda) and released into the extracellular space as extracellular dopamine (eda). The state variables of the model equations are in rectangles, and enzymes that determine reaction rates are in ellipses. Enzymes that are influenced by the molecular clock in the model are highlighted in yellow.https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1013508.g001In addition, the dopaminergic system is known to display ultradian rhythms with periods ranging from 1-6 hours [35,36]. Ultradian rhythms are fundamental to various physiological processes, including hormone secretion, sleep stages, and behavioral arousal [37–39]. In mammals, ultradian rhythms play a crucial role in organizing behavioral activity and enhancing responsiveness to environmental stimuli, thereby contributing to survival and adaptive behaviors. Inhibiting dopamine reuptake lengthens the period of these ultradian rhythms [39]. Previous studies hypothesized that DA self-feedback via D2 autoreceptors can generate ultradian oscillations [40]. We extend our reduced model to include sensing of overall extracellular DA produced by a local population of neurons. This coupling introduces intrinsic delays in autoregulatory mechanisms, enabling the emergence of ultradian dopamine rhythms. Within this framework, we also examine how DRIs might influence the period of ultradian rhythms.InSect 2.1, we discuss how circadian rhythms influence the dynamics of the dopaminergic system. InSect 2.2, we study the effects of drug administration time of DRIs on the dynamical behaviors of intracellular and extracellular dopamine in the model, explaining why certain administration times cause larger daily fluctuations in dopamine. InSect 2.3we investigate the stability of the model solutions for a wide range of drug half-lives and inhibitory effects. Finally, inSect 2.4, we develop a Dopamine Ultradian Oscillator (DUO) model by introducing anedapool that accumulates dopaminergic output from neuron terminals and feeds back via D2 autoreceptors, enabling intrinsic ultradian dopamine rhythms. InSect 2.5, we investigate how DRIs and other parameters in the DUO model modulate the resulting oscillatory periodicity and amplitude in the absence of circadian input. The MATLAB code available athttps://github.com/rubyshkim/YaoKim_DAcan be used forin silicoexperiments to form new hypotheses about chronotherapeutic effects of drugs acting on the dopaminergic system.2. ResultsWe reduced the mathematical model in [9] from 9 differential equations to only 4 by focusing on the dynamics between levodopa (ldopa), cytosolic dopamine (cda), vesicular dopamine (vda), and extracellular dopamine (eda). The reduction allows for detailed analyses of the dynamical behaviors as well as large-scale computations, including parameter sweeps. In the dopaminergic terminal,ldopais formed from tyrosine via the tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) enzyme-catalyzed reaction. Then, it is decarboxylated to formcda, which is then packaged into vesicles asvdaand released into the extracellular space aseda. At high concentrations,edafeeds back to inhibitTHactivity. For large enoughDATactivity,edais remarkably robust to changes inTHactivity; seeSect 4.3in the Methods. We see that there is a homeostatic region where changes inTHorDATactivity do not significantly impacteda, but outside of this regionedacan become highly sensitive to the activity of these enzymes. We describe the model reduction and compare it to the full model in more detail inSect 4.3.Having confirmed that our reduced model reproduces the behavior in [9] well, the sensitivity toDATactivity outside of the homeostatic region motivated us to study the effects of DRIs that target and inhibitDATand to investigate time-of-day effects inSects 2.1,2.2, and2.3. InSect 2.3, we explore a wide range of dosing times and doses. InSects 2.4,2.5we extend the reduced model to incorporate feedback from a local dopamine pool and find that these mechanisms are enough to generate flexible ultradian rhythms.2.1. Circadian rhythms of dopamine synthesisWe have previously created mathematical models of circadian rhythms in dopamine produced by regulation of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and monoamine oxidase (MAO), involved in synthesis and degradation respectively, by the molecular clock [23,24], having further extended the models to study reciprocal influences of dopamine and melatonin on circadian rhythms [29,41]. Animal studies have revealed circadian rhythms inTHlevels across different brain regions [27,42,43] with REV-ERB circadian nuclear receptors repressingTHgene transcription [27]. TheMAOenzyme also varies with circadian rhythms, with gene transcription activated by the Brain and muscle arnt-like (BMAL1) clock protein [25]. In the midbrain, the clock proteins BMAL1 and REV-ERB are antiphasic [27] and in our mathematical models [23,24] we found that these mechanisms generate a nearly antiphasic relationship between circadian rhythms ofTHandMAOactivity. As a result, in this study we assumed time-dependent circadian variation inTHactivity andMAO-mediated catabolism,and, to study circadian time-dependent administration of drugs that target the dopaminergic system. We varied the enzyme activities sinusoidally, multiplyingbyandby. The phases were chosen so that the phase gap is 8 hours as predicted by our previous model [23]. Both curves were simplistically chosen to vary from 0.75 to 1.25, so that the activity varies 25% below and above. This amplitude is close to those measured in our detailed circadian-dopamine model with curves fit to animal data, where the amplitude ofTHmRNA levels was about 0.5 of its peak value and the amplitude ofMAOactivity was about 0.2 of its peak value [23]. The phase shifts were chosen so thatreaches its maximum 18 hours into a 24-hour cycle andpeaks roughly 8 hours later, as observed in earlier simulations [23]. In the next section where we study dose timing, the timing will be relative to these choices in phase shift. We note, however, thatCMAOhad relatively little effect on the model solutions, and periodic behaviors are effectively driven byCTH. With time-dependent changes inTHandMAOactivity, there are corresponding circadian rhythms in reaction velocities and variable concentrations; seeFig 2. The rate of conversion ofldopatocdais30μM/hr whileμM/hr. As a result,cdais packaged into vesicles much more quickly than it is synthesized. In addition, the nominal model has a constant release rate of, sovdais released asedaat a rate of about 80μM/hr. Because the packaging and release steps occur at similar rates in the model (μM/hr), the time profiles ofvdaandedaclosely follow that ofcda. Thus, while the peak inldopaoccurs 17.169 hours into the cycle,cda,vda, andedaall peak 1.55 hours later. In addition, it is known that enzyme expression varies by about 25% between individuals of the same species [44–46], and we find that the qualitative behavior is robust to 25% shifts in the baseline of circadian variation; see the dotted curves inFig 2.Download:PPTPowerPoint slidePNGlarger imageTIFForiginal imageFig 2.Circadian rhythms of dopamine synthesis, release, and reuptake.The variables and reaction rates in the model display circadian rhythms due to the influence of the molecular clock onTHandMAOactivity.

Dotted curves correspond to circadian variation relative to 0.75 and 1.25 of nominaland, demonstrating robustness of the model behavior to shifts in the baseline of variation. Dashed gray lines indicate nominal steady state values.https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1013508.g0022.2. Critical timing of dopamine reuptake inhibitorsIn this section, we demonstrate that circadian rhythms in the enzyme activity in the model create time-dependent changes in the efficacy of reuptake inhibitors. A class of drugs called dopamine reuptake inhibitors (DRIs) increases extracellular dopamine concentrations by binding to dopamine transporters (DATs) and inhibiting the reuptake of dopamine into the cell. As detailed in the Methods, we modeled the effect of DRIs as a fraction 1−xdose(t) multiplied to the velocity of the DAT reaction,. In the model,xdoseincreases instantaneously at some administration time and decays exponentially. Whenxdose= 0, there is no effect in the model, and when, the velocity of the reaction is reduced. We tested various experimental conditions, summarized inTable 3in the Methods. To test for circadian variation in DRI efficacy, we introduced doses of 0.2 and 0.5 (reducingby 20% and 50%) administered att=  6, 12, 18, and 24; seeFig 3. We assumed a half-life of 15 hours, close to the half-life of modafinil which is used to promote wakefulness [47]. Throughout this section, we assume modafinil-like kinetics, and inSect 2.3we experiment with half-lives. The administration of the DRI causes a large spike ineda, which falls back down over the course of the day.Download:PPTPowerPoint slidePNGlarger imageTIFForiginal imageFig 3.Single-dose administration of a dopamine reuptake inhibitor (DRI) at different times of the day.(A) The plotted doses initially block either 20% or 50% of the dopamine transporters and decay exponentially with a half-life of 15 hours. The time of administration (6, 12, 18, or 24 hours into the day) has a substantial influence on theedacurve, which is plotted relative to its nominal steady-state concentration in the absence of drug. A gray dotted line shows the time course ofedain the absence of drug and serves as a reference trajectory.Dose= 0.2 or 0.5 at a single administration timet= 6, 12, 18, or 24, going left to right. (B) Time-dependent efficacy of DRIs. During the 24 hours following a single dose of a DRI, the effects on meanedaare minimal. However, there are substantial effects of dose time on the median and standard deviation ofeda. Solid curves correspond to an initial DAT occupancy of 20% and dashed curves correspond to 50% occupancy and the DRI half-life is taken to be 15 hours as in the previous panel.Dose= 0.2 or 0.5 at single administration times throughout the entire day.https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1013508.g003We find that the administration time of DRIs has a substantial effect on the dynamical behavior of dopamine in the model. The inhibition of dopamine reuptake causesedato rapidly increase andldopa,cda, andvdato decrease. When the DRI is administered at a time when all model variables are elevated (e.g.t= 18), even though extracellular dopamine levels go up rapidly, the rate of theTHreaction,, is on its way back down due to circadian rhythms. Because the production of intracellular dopamine is decreasing over the next few hours,edalevels are not sustained.To summarize the time-dependent effects of DRIs, we computed the mean, median, and standard deviation ofedaduring the 24-hour period following each dose. These metrics capture different aspects of the system’s response: the mean reflects the overall magnitude of elevation, the median provides a measure of the typicaledalevel over the 24-hour window, and the standard deviation indicates variability in the response profile. In particular, a higher median suggests thatedaremains elevated for a substantial portion of the 24-hour period. Together, these metrics offer a compact and interpretable summary of how DRI efficacy depends on the time of administration.We found that the largest changes in mean or medianedaover the next 24 hours do not necessarily come from large spikes in the concentration. We tested dose times every half-hour fromt= 0 tot= 24 and found that the meanedaduring the 24-hour period following administration did not change significantly; seeFig 3B. Interestingly, the medianedavaried significantly from 12.9% to 26.8% above steady state forDose= 0.5. The standard deviation ofedaover the 24-hour period following administration was also sensitive to dose time. When DRIs are administered whenedais elevated and before dopamine synthesis naturally decreases due to circadian rhythms, the boost inedais large but short-lived (e.g. <6 hours). When DRIs are administered before the natural increase in dopamine synthesis, theedaboost is relatively small but the circadian drive kicks in andedastays elevated longer. Dopamine is essential for executive functions [48], and the time-of-day effects predicted by our model are consistent with clinical studies measuring cognitive performance. Modafinil administered during circadian troughs (early morning) had the most noticeable effect on alertness and performance on cognitive tasks [49,50], with efficacy lasting about 10 hours despite its half-life of 10-15 hours [49].With repeated doses ofDose= 0.2 at the same time each day, we find that the time of administration has a substantial influence on the dynamical behavior of dopamine in the long run as well. Repeated daily doses increase the concentration ofedaon average over time; seeFig 4A. As in our simulations with a single dose, administration att= 18 quickly increasededasubstantially (by more than 20%) after the first dose. With repeated doses, the spike inedawent up to 40% above the steady state value. We found that the time of administration did not have a significant influence on the long-term change in the moving mean over time, but that it influenced the shape of theedacurve like in our single dose simulations. The 24-hour moving median and moving standard deviation were both sensitive to dose time, a pattern we found across a wide range of doses; seeFig 4B. While we might not see noticeable changes in the concentration ofedaon average, the dynamical behaviors are notably different across dose administration times, with larger daily fluctuations inedafor dose times betweent= 12 andt= 24.Download:PPTPowerPoint slidePNGlarger imageTIFForiginal imageFig 4.Repeated doses of DRIs at different times of the day.(A) A DRI dose is given at the same time every day, 6 hours into the day (yellow curve) or 18 hours into the day (blue curve) for 7 days. Both dosing schedules elevate the 24-hour moving mean and median ofedarelative to the nominal steady state concentration over the course of several days. Though repeated doses at 18 hours cause initial spikes ineda, the 24-hour moving median remains consistently lower over the following 7 days compared to dosing at 6 hours, indicating thatedastays elevated for a larger portion of each 24-hour period when doses are given at 6 hours. The 24-hour standard deviations indicate thatedais much more variable throughout a 24-hour period with the later administration time.Dose= 0.2 for administration timesti= 6 + 24(i−1) (yellow curve) orti= 18 + 24(i−1) (blue curve) for. (B) Heat maps of mean, median, and standard deviation across 7 days of repeated doses for varying doses and dose times.https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1013508.g0042.3. Stable dosing regimesWe expected the influence of DRI administration in the model on extracellular dopamine concentrations to depend on the half-life of the administered drug. InSect 2.2, we assumed a half-life of 15 hours for doses that initially inhibit 0.2 or 0.5 of the dopamine transporters. These doses had time-dependent effects on the temporal dynamics ofeda, with some dose/dose-time combinations causing large spikes followed by a rapid decline and others allowingedato be sustained for longer. In the differential equations, most of the extracellular dopamine is taken back up into the cell, at a rate of. With longer half-lives, repeated daily doses of DRIs can causeedato accumulate rapidly. We computed meanedaover 7 days of repeated doses att= 6 for half-lives between 1 and 24 hours and doses between 0 and 1 (0% and 100% initial inhibition ofDAT). The average concentration ofedadid not change more than two-fold for a large range of half-lives and doses; seeFig 5A.Download:PPTPowerPoint slidePNGlarger imageTIFForiginal imageFig 5.Stable dosing regimes and linear stability analysis.(A) Meanedaover 7 days of repeated daily doses att= 6. The change in meanedais robust to a large range of half-lives and doses. The meanedamonotonically increases with both half-life and dose, with steep changes outside of the homeostatic plateau (large blue region). (B) Largest real part of the eigenvalues obtained from linear stability analysis over a full 24-hour circadian cycle, evaluated under varying levels of. The yellow shaded region represents the range of maximum real eigenvalues across circadian phases for each value ofsDAT. The blue line denotes the average of these eigenvalues at eachactivity level. The consistently negative values indicate that the system’s equilibrium remains locally stable across all circadian phases and drug inhibition levels. (C) Average equilibriumeda* across circadian phases for. The thick purple line shows the mean over 24 hrs, and the shaded region indicates circadian variation. Equilibriumeda* decreases monotonically with increasingactivity, reflecting convergence to lower steady states as drug effects decay.https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1013508.g005Next, we performed a linear stability analysis of the nominal model described byEqs (15)–(18), incorporating a scaling factorapplied toto simulate the pharmacodynamic effect of DRIs at specific time points. A value ofsDAT= 1 corresponds to the absence of drug effect, while values less than 1 represent increasing degrees of transporter inhibition following drug administration. The time-dependent drug effect was previously modeled using an exponential decay, and heresDATreflects the instantaneousactivity at any given time.To assess how stability depends on dosing phase, we swept the circadian phasethat modulatesand. At each pairwe treated the clock parameters as fixed (taking the quasi-static assumption that the clock varies more slowly than dopamine dynamics), solved for the biologically feasible equilibrium, and evaluated the Jacobian matrixat equilibrium. Numerical calculations indicate that this feasible equilibrium is unique for every. Details of calculations can be found in the Matlab code in thecode repository. We then derived the characteristic polynomial, and solved for its roots to assess local stability.Fig 5B presents the average of the largest real parts of the eigenvalues across allforsDATvalues ranging from 0.01 to 1. The shaded yellow region indicates the range of these maximum real eigenvalues over the circadian cycle for each level ofactivity. At very low values ofsDAT, particularly when the value approaches zero, certain circadian phases such asproduce positive real eigenvalues. For instance, whensDAT= 0 orsDAT= 0.0001, the system exhibits local instability at this specific phase. However, despite these outliers, the dominant eigenvalue remains negative across most circadian phases, suggesting that the timing of DRI dosing has a limited impact on overall system stability. Importantly, all eigenvalues remain negative across the full range of simulated conditions in the majority of cases, confirming that the equilibrium state (seeFig 5C) is locally stable under varying degrees ofactivity and circadian modulation. Thus, although these equilibria represent transient approximations under constant effect of circadian phase, they provide valuable insight into the dynamics and stability characteristics of the system under circadian modulation.Fig 5C shows the average equilibriumeda*, similarly across allforsDATvalues ranging from 0.01 to 1. The shaded light purple region illustrates the extent of circadian variation. We observe that the average equilibriumeda* decreases monotonically with increasingactivity. Although the time-dependent drug effect is analytically complex,Fig 5C demonstrates that as the drug effect exponentially decays according to the drug’s half-life,edaprogressively converges towards its equilibrium state, which steadily decreases. This behavior aligns with findings presented inFig 3, showing that following a single dose,edasmoothly converges to its equilibrium.While our primary linear stability analysis was performed at equilibrium points for fixedsDATandϕ, this approach approximates the behavior of the system along actual drug decay trajectories. This is because as the drug effect wanes over time, the system’s state evolves along a sequence of slowly changing equilibria determined by the instantaneous value ofsDAT. In this quasi-static regime, evaluating the Jacobian at each of these equilibria effectively captures the system’s local stability along the drug decay trajectory. Therefore, although we do not explicitly compute the Jacobian along a full time-course trajectory (Fig 3A andFig 4A), our analysis inFig 5C implicitly reflects this evolution, as it shows how the system tracks the moving equilibrium assDATdecays. These findings are consistent with the results shown inFig 5A, which demonstrate robust system output across a wide spectrum of dosing regimens and drug half-lives.2.4. Generation of ultradian oscillations via coupling to dopaminergic networkWe extended our reduced dopamine model by adding two additionalEqs (20)and (21) to explore the potential for intrinsic ultradian dopamine oscillations driven by neuronal population-level feedback. This Dopamine Ultradian Oscillator (DUO) framework is motivated by experimental observations of ultradian rhythms in behavior and physiology [39,51], which are hypothesized to originate from collective dopaminergic activity in neuronal populations.In the DUO model, extracellular dopamine (eda) diffuses from multiple dopaminergic neuron terminals into a shared extracellular dopamine pool (edapool), representing local dopaminergic tone; seeFig 6A. Elevatededapoollevels activate autoreceptor-mediated signaling (D2), which provides delayed negative feedback on dopamine release. This model structure enables intrinsic ultradian rhythms independent of external circadian input. Using a representative parameter set (see details inSect 4.5), we observed stable oscillations inedawith an ultradian period of approximately 4.6 hours in the absence of circadian modulation (Fig 6B).Download:PPTPowerPoint slidePNGlarger imageTIFForiginal imageFig 6.Schematic representation and simulation of Dopamine Ultradian Oscillator (DUO) demonstrating ultradian rhythms with and without circadian modulation.(A) Schematic illustration of the DUO mechanism.edadiffuses locally from dopaminergic neuron terminals into a collective dopamine pool (edapool).

Parameters for simulations in (B) and (C) were,,,,,,,m= 1.1.https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1013508.g006We then examined the behavior of the DUO under circadian regulation ofTHandMAOactivity as inSect 2.1. The ultradian rhythm persisted, maintaining a similar period of 4.6 hours, but was now modulated by the slower 24-hour circadian cycle (Fig 6C). Both rhythms were clearly evident: the circadian rhythm shaped the underlying time course of dopamine, with loweredaconcentrations during simulated sleep intervals and higher levels during wakefulness, while the ultradian oscillations emerged as modulations around the primary circadian signal. Notably, the amplitude of ultradian oscillations varied over the circadian cycle, becoming more pronounced when dopamine synthesis was elevated, illustrating a dynamic interaction between the two rhythmic processes.In previous sections, we assumed that the 24-hour variation inedawas solely governed by circadian regulation ofTHandMAO, and thus did not account for ultradian influences. However, incorporating ultradian rhythms introduces additional complexity, as both the amplitude and period of these rhythms vary considerably across individuals—a variability observed in behavioral and dopaminergic ultradian oscillations, which lack the intrinsic stability of circadian rhythms and are highly responsive to changes in dopamine tone [39,51]. To reduce this complexity and focus on core dynamical features, we opted to use a fixedactivity level,sDAT, rather than modeling a time-dependent drug concentration. This simplification allows us to systematically explore how different steady-state levels of reuptake inhibition affect ultradian dynamics, without the confounding variability introduced by dose timing and individual-specific ultradian profiles. While a time-dependent dosing model may be appropriate in some contexts, it offers limited interpretability here due to the intrinsic variability of ultradian rhythms.Building on this approach, we next explored how DRIs influence ultradian periodicity by varying theactivity level (sDATfrom 0.3 to 1) and calculating the resulting ultradian periods (Fig 7A). As reuptake was increasingly inhibited, the ultradian period lengthened from close to 4 hours towards 12 hours, consistent with experimental findings that DRIs slow ultradian behavioral rhythms [39]. We also examined how ultradian-circadian interactions changed under different DRI levels (Fig 7B). At lower inhibition (sDAT= 1), dopamine oscillations retained a shorter, more regular ultradian rhythm. AssDATdecreased (i.e., stronger inhibition), the oscillations became broader in period and more irregular in amplitude. These changes reflect a complex interplay between the intrinsic dynamics of the DUO and the entraining influence of the circadian rhythm. Overall, our results suggest that DRIs modulate both the frequency and amplitude of dopamine ultradian rhythms, and that these effects are further shaped by the phase and strength of circadian inputs.Download:PPTPowerPoint slidePNGlarger imageTIFForiginal imageFig 7.Influence of drug-induced inhibition on the period of ultradian rhythms and their modulation within circadian cycles.(A) Dependence of the ultradian rhythm period on varying drugactivity levels (sDAT) ranging from 0.3 to 1.

Bifurcation analysis of the Dopamine Ultradian Oscillator (DUO)In this section, we characterize the limit-cycle dynamics of the DUO model through linear stability analysis in the absence of circadian modulation. Initially, we numerically computed the steady-state solution, denoted as, from the system described byEqs (15)–(21). Subsequently, the Jacobian matrix,, was analytically derived using Mathematica (details of the derivation can be found in the Mathematica notebook in thecode repository). Given that the steady-statez* explicitly depends on the parametersDAT, we substitutedback intofor each selected value ofsDAT.We then derived the characteristic polynomial of the Jacobian matrix:Solving for roots numerically, we identified the eigenvalues corresponding to eachsDAT. Our analysis shows that the eigenvalues possess nonzero imaginary parts across the entire range of, indicating oscillatory behavior. Importantly, the largest real part of the eigenvalues transitions from negative to positive assDATdecreases through the critical valuesDAT= 0.26, indicating a Hopf bifurcation point (Fig 8A). Biologically, this result implies that large-enough inhibition of DAT activity (lowersDATvalues) can disrupt the ultradian rhythmic behavior inherent to the system.Download:PPTPowerPoint slidePNGlarger imageTIFForiginal imageFig 8.Bifurcation analysis of the Dopamine Ultradian Oscillator (DUO) with respect tosDAT.(A) Maximum real part of eigenvalues of the Jacobian matrix as a function ofsDATdemonstrate the presence of a Hopf bifurcation atsDAT= 0.26. (B) Non-monotonic relationship betweensDATand the amplitude ofedaoscillations. AssDATdecreases, amplitude initially increases, peaking atsDAT= 0.42. Further reductions insDATsharply diminish oscillation amplitude, ultimately abolishing ultradian behavior at sufficiently lowDATactivity. (C) Sensitivity analysis showing stable ultradian rhythms across individual parameter variations (0.75–1.25 × baseline), demonstrating DUO model robustness. The baseline parameters used in simulations were the same as inFig 7.https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1013508.g008To further elucidate the impact of dopamine reuptake inhibition on the oscillatory dynamics, we examined the amplitude ofedaoscillations as a function ofsDAT. As illustrated inFig 8B, the oscillation amplitude exhibits a non-monotonic relationship withsDAT. Specifically, the amplitude increases with decreasingsDATuntil it reaches a maximum at approximatelysDAT= 0.39. Beyond this point, further reduction ofsDATsharply decreases the amplitude, ultimately abolishing ultradian rhythms altogether. Thus, our model predicts that while moderate inhibition of DAT can increase the amplitude of ultradian fluctuations, excessive inhibition destabilizes and suppresses these rhythmic patterns.Besides evaluating drug effects, we also examined the sensitivity of the DUO model to variations in all other parameters. To quantify this sensitivity, we introduced a relative magnitude as a scalar multiplier for each parameter in the DUO model. Each parameter was individually varied from 0.75 to 1.25 times its original baseline value. For each adjusted parameter set, we numerically simulated the DUO model over a duration of 100 days. The system’s behavior during the final 4 days of each simulation was recorded to represent the steady-state response.We generated ridge plots to visualize the amplitude and period of theedaoscillations for parameter sets corresponding toFig 7. Similar plots for parameter sets shown inFig 6are provided inS1 Fig. As illustrated inFig 8C, varying each parameter within the 0.75 to 1.25 range consistently resulted in non-zero amplitudes and periods, confirming the robustness of ultradian rhythmic behavior in the model. Additionally, both amplitude and period did not change dramatically, suggesting that ultradian rhythms in our model can persist despite natural parameter fluctuations.3. DiscussionIn this paper, we reduced a detailed model of dopamine synthesis, release, and reuptake [9] from 9 to 4 state variables, demonstrating that the reduced model displays similar, biologically realistic dynamics related to autoregulatory mechanisms. We had previously created mathematical models studying the circadian regulation of dopamine metabolism [23,24,29]. Several studies suggest that drugs targeting the dopaminergic system and dopamine transporters will have time-of-day effects [52,53] and experimentalists have demonstrated time-of-day changes in locomotor sensitization to cocaine [54]. As a result, we used the reduced model to explore time-of-day effects of DRIs, showing that administration in the early morning during circadian troughs allow dopamine levels to be sustained for much longer. Dopamine is important for executive functions [48], and clinical studies have suggested that modafinil is most effective during early morning [49,50].In general, we did not find many other studies investigating the time-of-day effects of drugs targeting the dopaminergic system. However, our mathematical model provides strong evidence that time-of-day effects in the dopaminergic system could be quite important and underscores the need for further experimental work in this area. In our model, when DRIs are administered during the circadian trough of dopamine synthesis, dopamine concentrations transiently go up since dopamine reuptake is blocked. Then, as the effects of the DRIs wear off towards the natural circadian peak of dopamine synthesis, dopamine levels are sustained. Potential experimental studies could measure DRI efficacy at different time points throughout the day in relation to endogenous rhythms (e.g. melatonin, cortisol, body temperature).In addition, clinical studies on modafinil timing [49,50] focus on alertness and performance during sleep deprivation, but DRIs other than modafinil can be prescribed for various conditions, including ADHD, depression, and addiction [17]. Thus, “DRI efficacy” can be defined in various ways. Human studies on modafinil and attention might track behavioral measures such as the psychomotor vigilance task (PVT). Brain imaging techniques can be used to determine dopamine activity, such as after sleep deprivation [55]. Different DRIs will have different pharmacokinetic properties, and we find that half-life has a substantial effect in the model. Animal studies have measured extracellular dopamine or dopamine metabolite levels under various experimental conditions targeting the dopaminergic system [56,57]. We believe that the circadian timing of drugs targeting the dopaminergic system is an exciting yet understudied area that can be explored in both human and animal studies. With the availability of new experimental data, future modeling work can explore the effects of drug absorption, DAT binding affinity, and other pharmacokinetic parameters. Based on our model, we hypothesize that treatments near circadian troughs of dopamine are most effective at sustaining dopamine levels.We found that extracellular dopamine concentrations are remarkably robust to dopamine reuptake inhibitors for a wide range of doses and half-lives (seeFig 5), and once the dose and half-life were large enough, dopamine concentrations increased rapidly. This dynamical feature was expected, as many homeostatic systems display sensitivity outside of some homeostatic range. Our model could be used to study how changes in parameters, such as those related to gene polymorphisms, could influence the homeostatic range and thus the efficacy of DRIs. It’s worth noting that the circadian effects in our model are in relation to the circadian rhythms of dopamine driven by the chosen variation inTHandMAOactivity. While the circadian trough of dopamine may often occur in the early morning, circadian rhythms are highly variable across individuals and even day-to-day within the same individual. Thus, it is important that experimental studies on the timing of DRIs consider measuring circadian markers such as cortisol for reference.Furthermore, we show that the model can be modified minimally to investigate ultradian rhythms in DA. The DUO is thought to be an important driver of behavioral and physiological ultradian rhythms in mammals [35,36], but the underlying mechanisms are not well understood. We showed that, by coupling our reduced model with an extracellular dopamine pool, the system is capable of robust ultradian rhythms with a period of about 4 to 12 hours. As dopamine reuptake is inhibited, the ultradian period lengthens, aligning with experimental findings [39]. With this extension, our model also provides a novel framework for understanding complex interactions between circadian and ultradian rhythms in the dopaminergic system and how they modulate dynamical changes in dopamine.4. Methods4.1. Model reductionThe model of dopamine synthesis, release, and reuptake by Best et al. [9] consists of 9 ordinary differential equations describing changes in the concentrations of variables: dihydrobiopterin (bh2), tetrahydrobiopterin (bh4), tyrosine (tyr), l-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (ldopa), cytosolic dopamine (cda), vesicular dopamine (vda), extracellular dopamine (eda), homovanillic acid (hva), and tyrosine pool (tyrpool). The equations are provided below.(1)(2)(3)(4)(5)(6)(7)(8)(9)The reaction rates are given by(10)(11)(12)(13)(14)whereNADPH= 330 andNADP= 26 are cofactors for the DRR reaction and all other parameter values are provided inTable 1. The steady state concentrations of the full model areand.Download:PPTPowerPoint slidePNGlarger imageTIFForiginal imageTable 1.Parameter values in full model (=μM,=μM/hr, and= 1/hr).https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1013508.t001We reduced the model from 9 to 4 state variables by making several simplifications to the biological assumptions. First, we assume the substrate tyrosine is relatively stable in the cell (at steady-state,M in [9]). It is known that tyrosine availability in the blood has a minimal influence on dopamine synthesis, suggesting homeostatic mechanisms that maintain stable intracellular tyrosine concentrations [58]. In the full model,tyrenters into the neuron at a constant rate and exchanges linearly with the tyrosine pool. We take, removingEqs (3)and (9) from the full model and taking the steady statetyr= 126. Note thattyrpooldoes not appear in any of the other equations in the full model.Then, we fix tetrahydrobiopterin (at steady state,M in [9]) and dihydrobiopterin (at steady state,M in [9]). In the full model, the inhibition ofTHbycdacompetes with the activation ofTHbybh4. The cofactorbh4is typically tightly regulated and alterations in concentration are associated with neurological diseases like Parkinson’s and neuroinflammation [59]. Takingfurther reduces our system. This reduction closely approximates the original model sinceEqs (1)and (2) couple to the rest of the system via(Eq (10)) and the effect ofbh4onquickly saturates. Finally, since homovanillic acid (hva) is downstream of the system, we chose to omit it in this study. Thus, we were able to reduce the system by a total of 5 state variables. The 4 remaining variables in our reduced model of dopamine synthesis are l-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (ldopa), cytosolic dopamine (cda), vesicular dopamine (vda), and extracellular dopamine (eda). Schematic diagrams of both the full and reduced mathematical models are provided inFig 1for comparison.4.2. Reduced model equationsThe simplifications described inSect 4.1allowed for a much smaller, more analytically tractable system of equations. The 4 ordinary differential equations in the reduced model are given byEqs (15)–(18),(15)(16)(17)(18)withgiven byEq (10)with fixedtyr= 126 andbh4= 319. Thus, the first factor inEq (10)is effectively a constant. The second factor models the effect of autoreceptors viaedafeedback, whereat steady-state (M) and ifedagoes above or below the steady state the factor will reduce or increase, respectively. Withtyrandbh4as constants, the third factor models the inhibition bycda. Based on the parameter values, this effect is relatively small.The remaining reaction rates are kept the same as in the full model [9] and are provided below:All parameter values for the reduced model were kept the same as in [9] and are provided inTable 2. The parameter choices are explained in detail by Best et al. [9], justified by experimental measurements and observations. Thus, we felt it was appropriate to use them as the baseline for our model. Numerical solutions of the reduced model were computed using ode23s in MATLAB. The MATLAB code is provided athttps://github.com/rubyshkim/YaoKim_DA.Download:PPTPowerPoint slidePNGlarger imageTIFForiginal imageTable 2.Parameter values in reduced model (=μM,=μM/hr, and= 1/hr).https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1013508.t002InSect 2.1, we multiplybyandbyto model the circadian variation in enzyme activity, where the phase shifts and amplitudes were chosen to match detailed models of circadian control of dopamine synthesis [23,24].4.3. Reduced model preserves important dynamical behaviorsWe investigated numerical solutions to confirm that important dynamical features related to autoregulation were preserved. In the full model [9], equations and parameters were carefully determined based on known kinetics and experimental measurements. A schematic diagram of the model is provided inFig 1A. In our reduced model (Fig 1B), we used the same functional forms and parameters and expected to get similar steady state concentrations. The steady state concentrations inμM of the variables in the reduced model,andeda= 0.002, are identical to the concentrations reported in the full model with the exception ofvdawhich is 99.9% of the full model’s concentration. These values are also biologically plausible. Experimental measurements suggest that extracellular dopamine in the midbrain is typically in the low nanomolar range [60–62]. At steady state, the model concentration of vesicular dopamine is about 4.6 orders of magnitude larger thaneda. About 97% of intracellular dopamine (cda+) is stored in the vesicles in the model, consistent with experimental studies [63,64].The full model constructed by Best et al. [9] displays dopamine homeostasis to firing rate and enzyme activity due to autoreceptor feedback, modeled via the second term in,Eq (10). Our reduced model almost exactly reproduces the homeostatic behavior studied in [9] in response to changes in firing rate. In the simulations, firing rate is adjusted by multiplying a functionfire(t) in the equations forvdaandeda. In the nominal model,. In the absence of autoreceptors in both the full and reduced models,edais sensitive to firing rate, where a 2-fold increase in firing rate causes a 2-fold increase in extracellular dopamine concentration. With autoreceptors, theedacurve is much more robust to changes in firing rate; seeFig 9A, which is almost identical to Fig 9 (lower panel) in [9].Download:PPTPowerPoint slidePNGlarger imageTIFForiginal imageFig 9.Homeostasis in reduced mathematical model.The reduced mathematical model displays the same homeostatic features as in the full model. (A) The autoreceptors allow extracellular dopamine (eda) to be relatively robust to changes in firing rate. Theedaconcentration is plotted as a percentage of the nominal steady state value. (B)edais homeostatic to changes in enzyme activity, that is, theof the reactions catalyzed byTHandDAT, within the 75–125% homeostatic region (contour lines). Outside this band, particularly at low activity levels, changes inedabecome much more drastic. The white dot corresponds to the nominal model. Values are plotted as percentages of nominal model values.https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1013508.g009In addition, our reduced model displays similar behaviors as in the full model [9] in response to changes in enzyme activity.THis the rate-limiting enzyme in dopamine synthesis and autoreceptors reduce fluctuations inedacaused by changes inTHactivity [9]. In simulations, we modify the maximum rates of theTHandDATreactions by 0-150% of their nominal values and calculate the corresponding steady-state value of eda; seeFig 9B compared to Fig 11 in [11].4.4. Dopamine reuptake inhibitorsWe modeled the effects of dopamine reuptake inhibitors (DRIs) by adding an additional variable for the concentration,xdose(t). The effect ofxdoseis that it inhibits the reuptake of dopamine back into the cell. We model this inhibition simplistically by multiplyingbyinEqs (16)and (18), so that whenxdose= 1 there is no reuptake and whenxdose= 0 reuptake happens at the normal rate. In addition,xdosedecays exponentially,(19)withrchosen appropriately based on measured half-lives of DRIs. In our simulations inFig 3andFig 4A, we chose to model a DRI with a half-life of 15 hours, close to the half-life of the drug modafinil [47], so that. We introduce instantaneous doses ofDoseat dose timest=tiwhereis the dirac delta function. In simulations, this is equivalent to updating the initial condition forxdoseat the administration times. In the Results, we demonstrate the effects of DRI timing in the model in several different conditions, summarized inTable 3.Download:PPTPowerPoint slidePNGlarger imageTIFForiginal imageTable 3.Simulation conditions for the Circadian Time (CT) of DRI administration.In our study,t= 0 coincides with CT0.https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1013508.t0034.5. Coupling of model toedapoolWe extend our model from the perspective that the DUO is composed of a population of oscillators rather than individual neurons [39,51]. We couple the model to a larger pool ofedain the projection region, so that the neuron senses dopaminergic tone. The localedadiffuses out, elevating dopaminergic tone, which then promotes autoreceptor signaling (D2). The two new ODEs are provided below, whereedapoolandD2 are dimensionless, latent variables representing dopaminergic tone and autoreceptor signaling.(20)(21)We couplefrom the original reduced model to theedapool by modifying the second term so that it depends onD2. The terminEq (10)is replaced by(22)which is a sigmoidal function that decreases withD2. In the model, when thesDATfraction is reduced from 1,edawill build up andD2 will also go up, soadapts by shifting to the right. In total, 2 new ODEs and 8 new parameters are added to describe coupling of the dopamine model to dopaminergic tone.The precise mechanisms of dopamine ultradian oscillations remain elusive [51]. As a result,edapoolandD2 are dimensionless and do not represent precise quantities, but are latent variables accounting for feedback from dopaminergic tone. We chose parameter values using Latin hypercube sampling with several assumptions. First, we took, accounting for contributions of dopamine from nearby dopaminergic terminals. Dopamine concentrations vary widely across brain regions [65,66], so we allowed for changes across three orders of magnitude,. The remainingforwere chosen to be small in comparison, within the range [0.1,40], and the parametersαandβwere chosen to keepqualitatively close to the autoreceptor term in the original model (Eq (10)), in the range [0.5,4.5]. The parameterwas chosen to shiftto have effects in the solution range ofD2, andadjusted the steepness of. Within these conditions, parameters leading to stable limit cycle solutions were considered.Supporting informationS1 Fig.https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1013508.s001(PDF)References1.Feldman RS, Meyer JS, Quenzer LF.
