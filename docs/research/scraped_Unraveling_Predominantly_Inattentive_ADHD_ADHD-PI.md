## Abstract

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, or ADHD, is a neurodevelopmental disorder with poorly understood molecular mechanisms. Recent studies have proposed that gene expression involved in regulating synaptic transmission in the striatum may play a role in ADHD pathogenesis. To explore the molecular basis of ADHD, we utilized proteomic analysis using whole striatal tissues from early adult thyroid hormone-responsive protein-overexpressing (THRSP-OE) mice, which displayed defining characteristics of predominantly inattentive ADHD (ADHD-PI). We focused on the striatal brain region due to its critical role in the regulation of attention, motivation, and reward processing. Moreover, the striatum modulates dopaminergic pathways that are known to be impaired in ADHD. Our analysis revealed an innate overexpression of Snap25 protein in THRSP-OE mice, indicating possible alterations in the SNARE protein complex and potential neurotransmitter dysregulation. Furthermore, a binding affinity study showed reduced dopamine D1 receptor binding concentrations and pronounced low dopamine levels in THRSP-OE mice. Repeated seven-day injections of methylphenidate improved the low dopamine levels, reducing the EEG theta/beta ratio in this animal model. These findings suggest new markers specific to the ADHD-PI presentation and further support the role of Snap25 dysregulation and possible SNARE protein complex alterations in ADHD-PI.

Despite its high prevalence, the underlying molecular mechanisms of ADHD remain poorly understood. Contemporary studies have suggested that changes in the expression of genes involved in the regulation of synaptic transmission in the striatum, a key brain region involved in attention, reward processing, and motor control, may play a role in the pathogenesis of ADHD. One such gene is synaptosomal-associated protein, 25 kDa or Snap25, which is altered in ADHD patients and animal models of ADHD [2,3,4], indicating a relationship between Snap25 and ADHD. Snap25 is a protein that plays a key role in regulating neurotransmitter release, and it has been linked to ADHD due to its involvement in dopamine signaling [5]. However, the exact nature of the relationship between Snap25 and ADHD is still the subject of ongoing research, and more studies are needed to understand this complex relationship fully.In our previous study, we found that overexpressing the thyroid hormone-responsive protein (THRSP) (a.k.a.spot14gene) induced ADHD predominantly inattentive (PI)-like behaviors in mice [6,7]. Interestingly, these thyroid and dopaminergic function alterations may be responsible for this behavior, as both systems are directly involved in regulating cognitive and attention behaviors [6,8]. Since THRSP is a thyroid hormone-related protein and is highly responsive to thyroid hormone, and since thyroid hormone and dopamine share tyrosine as a common basic unit, it is possible that functional overexpression of THRSP could influence the dopaminergic system in THRSP-OE mice [9].To significantly advance our understanding of the ADHD-PI-like behaviors identified in THRSP-OE mice and the potential mechanisms involved, we employed molecular, pharmacological, and electroencephalographic approaches. These investigations revealed that Snap25, a synaptic protein critical for neurotransmitter release and known to regulate attention and implicated in ADHD, may be involved in the observed ADHD-PI-like behaviors in early adult THRSP-OE mice. Moreover, our study demonstrated that methylphenidate administration yielded promising results in THRSP-OE mice, with notable enhancements in dopamine levels and a significant reduction in electroencephalography (EEG) theta/beta ratio (TBR) following 7 days of drug administration. These findings support the use of THRSP-OE mice as a model for adult ADHD and raise the possiblity that THRSP may be involved in the regulation of dopamine-related mechanisms relevant to the disorder.Materials and MethodsAnimalsThe mice used in this study were developed and obtained based on our previous studies on THRSP-OE and THRSP-KO mice [6,7,8]. In particular, the THRSP-OE mice model evaluated here has already been identified and validated to show impairments in attention and memory with the absence of hyperactivity and impulsivity indicating its potential use as a model for ADHD predominantly inattention presentation [9]. Non-transgenic littermates were used as WT counterparts. The mice were housed under controlled temperature (22 ± 2 °C) and humidity conditions (55 ± 5%) with a 12/12-h light/dark cycle (07:00–19:00 h light). All animal care and procedures followed the Principles of Laboratory Animal Care (NIH Publication No. 85–23, revised 1985), the Animal Ethics Review Board of Sahmyook University, South Korea (SYUIACUC2023-002), and complied with the 3Rs framework and ARRIVE guidelines recommended byMolecular Neurobiology. Male mice were exclusively used in the experiment because of established sex differences in ADHD prevalence, and to maintain consistency with the DSM-5 criteria for ADHD symptomatology. Also, since the gene (Thrsp or THRSP) manipulated in such animal models is a thyroid hormone-responsive protein, which may impact behavior differently between males and females, the study only focused on male mice. However, future studies will take sex differences into consideration. The mice were 7 weeks old during the experiment, indicating full body growth and at early adulthood age [10], similar to our previous study [7].Brain ExtractionBrain samples (striatum; STR) were taken from a total of seventy-two 7-week early adult mice. The striatal tissue samples were randomly assigned and subjected to proteomic analysis (n= 6/group, with an additional THRSP-KO group (n = 6)), real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) (n= 6/group), receptor-binding affinity studies (n= 5/group), and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (n= 8/group for THRSP-OE and WT mice, each treated with vehicle (VEH) and methylphenidate (MPH). The THRSP-KO samples were included exclusively for the proteomic analysis to serve as supplemental comparative data. This group was not the primary focus of the study, which specifically targeted the THRSP-OE model due to its relevance to ADHD-PI-like behaviors. Therefore, all subsequent analyses and tests were conducted by comparing results between THRSP-OE and WT mice. The striatal tissue samples were snap-frozen, placed in a dry ice-filled box, and then transported to our collaborators at the Seoul National University (for proteomic studies) and Chonnam National University (for binding-affinity studies) or stored in-house at Uimyung Research Institute for Neuroscience at Sahmyook University (for RT-qPCR and ELISA) until further use.Proteomic AnalysisThe protocol used in the proteomics studies, as shown in Fig.1a, was based on our previous study [7]. In brief, proteins were extracted from mouse striatal brain tissue samples using a radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer composed of 50 mM Tris–HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 1% NP-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, and 1% SDS. The extracted proteins were then quantified by bicinchoninic acid (BCA) protein assay. Two hundred milligrams of each sample was taken and, under reducing conditions, was resolved by sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), followed by Instant Blue Coomassie protein staining. Each lane was divided into ten separate segments for in-gel protein digestion. The stained gel fragments were sectioned, washed with 100 mM ammonium bicarbonate, and dehydrated with 50% acetonitrile in 25 mM ammonium bicarbonate. The reduction was performed by incubating the samples with 20 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) for 1 h at 60 °C, followed by 55 mM iodoacetamide incubation for 45 min in the dark for alkylation. After washing and dehydration with acetonitrile, the gel sections were incubated with 12.5 ng/μL trypsin in 50 mM Ammonium bicarbonate overnight and then stored at 37 °C to allow digestion. Peptide extraction was then carried out by incubation with 10% formic acid and further incubation with 50% acetonitrile in 0.1% formic acid and 80% acetonitrile in 0.1% formic acid at 37 °C. Further, the eluted peptides were dried in a SpeedVac and then stored at −20 °C until further use.Fig. 1Striatal proteomics workflow in thyroid hormone-responsive protein (THRSP) transgenic early adult (7 weeks old) mice (n= 6/group).aWith known ADHD-PI-like behaviors, mice striatum was subjected to subsequent proteomic analysis.bSummary of identified striatal DEPs in THRSP-OE and THRSP-KO relative to wild-type mice.

The images used inawas generated by BioRender.comFull size imageLiquid Chromatography–Mass Spectrometry (LC–MS/MS) and Data AnalysisThe methodology used for LC/MS/MS, as depicted in Fig.1a, was based on our previous research [7]. In brief, peptides were dissolved in solvent A (0.1% formic acid) and loaded onto an analytical column. They were then separated with a linear gradient of solvent B (0.1% formic acid in 98% acetonitrile) from 5 to 35% over 95 min at a 300 nL/min flow rate. The MS spectra were recorded using a Q-Exactive Plus hybrid quadrupole-orbitrap mass spectrometer and an Ultimate 3000 high-performance liquid chromatography system. The spray voltage standard mass spectrometric condition was 2.0 kV, and the heated capillary temperature was 250 °C. Full scans were acquired in the 400–1400 m/zrange with a resolution of 70,000 while setting the normalized collision energy to 27% with 17,500 resolutions, allowing fragmentation using high-energy collision dissociation. Data-dependent acquisition with a single survey MS scan followed by 10 MS/MS scans was performed with an exclusion time of 30 s. Using engine-based PEAKS studio, all collected MS/MS raw data were converted into mzXML files. Protein identification was carried out using the UniProt-Mus musculus database, with fragment mass tolerance of 0.8 Da and precursor mass tolerance of 10 ppm. Methionine oxidation was considered a variable amino acid modification, whereas cysteine carbamidomethylation was deemed a fixed modification. The enzyme selected for the experiment was trypsin, which allows up to two missed cleavages. The protein and peptide identifications were filtered to less than 1% false discovery rate (FDR) using a concatenated target-decoy database search strategy. The R program’s Power Law Global Error Model (PLGEM) package (version 3.4.2) was used for relative protein quantitation analysis. PLGEM controls datasets to distinguish statistically significant differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) and calculates changes in expression levels by p-value and signal-to-noise (STN) ratio. Further, the ingenuity pathway analysis was then performed using all significantly altered proteins, as shown in Fig.1b and Tables1and6. The MS proteomics data have been deposited to the ProteomeXchange Consortium via the PRoteomics IDEntifications Database (PRIDE) [11] partner repository with the dataset identifier PXD051619.Table 1 The striatal DEPs analyzed from THRSP transgenic (OE and KO) mice relative to WT miceFull size tableGene Ontology (GO) AnalysisAnalyses of GO biological processes (Figs.2a, 2b,3a, 3b), protein classifications (Figs.2c, 2 d,3c, 3 d), enriched pathways (Tables2,3), molecular functions (Table4), and reactome pathways (Table5) were performed using the PANTHER GO classification system (v.18) [12] using the identified DEPs from THRSP-OE and THRSP-KO mice relative to WT mice.

A similar process was conducted based on our previous publication [7], which assessed protein–protein interaction using the same software. The protein networks (Fig.4) generated were for all the DEPs identified in both the THRSP-OE and THRSP-KO models compared to the WT mice. Only high-confidence interactions, with the highest score of 0.90, were shown. The nodes in the network that were disconnected were excluded.Fig. 4Protein–protein interaction of all identified DEPs in THRSP-OE and THRSP-KO mice relative to WT mice based on the Proteomics data (n= 6/group), analyzed by STRING.

The nodes in the network that were disconnected are excludedFull size imageRNA Extraction and RT-qPCRBased on our previous protocol [6], total RNA from striatal tissue samples from THRSP-OE and wild-type mice (n= 6/group) were isolated using TRIzol™ Reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). A Hybrid-RTM Kit (Geneall Biotechnology, Seoul, Korea) was used for RNA purification. A Colibri Microvolume Spectrometer determined the total RNA concentration (Titertek-Berthold, Pforzheim, Germany). The RT-qPCR was employed to measure mRNA expression levels of differentially regulated proteins (Fig.5, Table6) and the corresponding SNARE protein complex-related targets (Fig.6). A 2.5 µg of total RNA was reverse transcribed into cDNA using AccuPower CycleScript RT Premix (Bioneer, Seoul, Korea) according to the manufacturer’s instructions and performed on a BioRad T100 Thermal Cycler. The cDNA amplification was performed using custom-made sequence-specific primers (Cosmogenetech, Seoul, Korea) and was detected with SYBR Green (Solgent, Korea). RT-qPCR analysis was performed in duplicate using the Applied Biosystems Step-One Plus Real-Time PCR System, with optimized cycling conditions that included a denaturing step at 94 °C for 1 min, followed by annealing at a primer-specific temperature for 1 min, and elongation at 72 °C for 45 s, for a total of 45 cycles. The resulting values were then normalized to the expression levels of Actin beta (actb), a housekeeping gene commonly used as a reference for RT-qPCR analysis. The 2−ΔΔCtformula was utilized to calculate the relative expression of target genes. A complete list of primers used in this study can be found in Supplementary Table5.Fig. 5The mRNA expression levels of differentially regulated proteins identified in THRSP-OE mice.

The pellet (samples) was re-suspended in an equal volume of buffer A and re-centrifuged for 10 min at 34,500 g. The samples were then re-suspended in buffer A, at a concentration of 10 mg (wet tissue weight/mL) for immediate use. Subsequently, ligand binding for D1 receptors was performed with 2 nM concentrations of [3H] SCH23390 performed for 1H at room temperature (21 °C). Moreover, ligand binding for D2/D3 receptors was performed with 3 nM concentrations of [3H]-Spiperone for 2.5H at 4 °C based on our previous protocols with modifications [14,15]. Afterwards, pellets were washed three times with ice-cold serum-free media, dissolved in 1% SDS, mixed with a liquid scintillation cocktail, and measured with a Wallac 1450 MicroBeta® TriLux liquid scintillation counter (PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA, USA) to determine the [3H] content for each sample.Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent AssayTo evaluate the total striatal tissue dopamine levels in mice (n= 8/group), we performed Dopamine ELISA (KA1887, Abnova, Taiwan), following our previously established protocol [16]. In brief, we prepared standards, controls, and samples using an extraction and acylation technique. A standard curve was generated using dopamine standards of known concentrations to quantify dopamine levels in the samples. After extraction, we added enzyme solution, supernatant (i.e., extracted standards, controls, and samples), and HCl into a 96-well dopamine microtiter plate, which was incubated at room temperature for 30 min. We then added dopamine anti-serum and incubated the plate at room temperature for 2 h. Following incubation, we discarded the samples and washed the plate three times with a wash buffer. Next, we incubated the plate with enzyme conjugate for 30 min, discarded it, and washed it three times. We then added TMB substrate and incubated the plate for 25 min, keeping it protected from direct light. Finally, we added the stop solution and measured absorbance at 450 nm using the EMax Plus Microplate Reader (Molecular Devices, San Jose, CA, USA). Dopamine concentrations in the samples were calculated by comparing the absorbance values to the standard curve generated from the known dopamine standards. We performed all measurements in duplicate to ensure accuracy.EEG Data Acquisition and Experimental ProcedureEEG was conducted to evaluate theta and beta waves in mice according to our previous study [8]. The mice were anesthetized using 0.02 mL of Zoletil® (50 mg/mL) and Rompun® (xylazine 23.32 mg/mL), and a three-channel tethered head mount (8200 K3-iS/iSE) was implanted. The head mount was fixed with two stainless screws in the frontal region (A/P − 1.0 mm, M/L − 1.5 mm) and two stainless screws in the posterior brain region (A/P − 1.0 mm, M/L ± 1.5 mm) using dental cement. We followed standard operating procedures to minimize animal suffering. After the implantation, the mice were given a 7-day recovery period before EEG recording. The mice were allowed to acclimatize to the EEG apparatus for 2 h (unrecorded) while attached to theter. The following day, we injected THRSP-OE and WT mice with a single administration of 5 mg/kg of methylphenidate (MPH), a first-line treatment for ADHD, and vehicle (VEH) (n= 6/group). Moreover, separate groups were injected with the same drug at varying doses (2, 5, 10 mg/kg) for 7 days to assess the effects of repeated MPH and VEH administration in the EEG in mice. The signals were adjusted to 400 Hz using a 14-bit A/D converter channeled to a computer-based software package, Sirenia® software suite (Pinnacle Technology, Inc., Lawrence, KS, USA).The EEG data analyses were conducted on channel 2 A-B (after removing EMG and 1 A-B channels) using MATLAB (R2021b, MathWorks Inc.). The 1 A-B channel was removed due to signal attenuation that occurred in most mice data. The data were bandpass-filtered using a finite impulse response filter with a high-pass filter with a cutoff frequency of 1 Hz and a low-pass filter with a cutoff frequency of 30 Hz to isolate the frequencies of interest while eliminating environmental and muscular artifacts. The resulting data was then downsampled to 100 Hz. Eye blinks in the data were mitigated by filtering the identified eye blink intervals through a hard-thresholding discrete wavelet transform (DWT) and restoring the filtered signal via inverse DWT. For the spectral approaches, we computed the power spectral density (PSD) at different EEG frequencies using the MATLAB pwelch function (with a 10-s window, 1024 number of discrete Fourier transform points, and 50% overlap). Following PSD calculation, power within the delta (1–4 Hz), theta (5–8 Hz), alpha (9–12 Hz), and beta (13–30 Hz) frequency bands was quantified using logarithmic transformations to express the data in decibels. Finally, the TBR was computed, which could serve as a biomarker of cognitive state and neurological condition. The TBR is a reliable measure of ADHD, diagnosed based on the presence of a higher TBR in individuals with ADHD compared to those without the disorder [17]. This ratio is calculated by dividing the theta wave power by the beta wave power and is used as an objective indicator of ADHD symptoms. To assess the drug efficacy (methylphenidate 5 mg/kg) in EEG, we extracted data over a 40-min time window after 5 min of drug administration.Statistical AnalysisStatistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism v10.4.0 (GraphPad Software, Inc., La Jolla, CA, USA). For graphical purposes, data are presented as mean ± standard error of the mean, and all statistical analyses were conducted on raw data. The results were analyzed using eithert-test or one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), followed by Tukey’s multiple comparison test. A level of probability ofP≤ 0.05 was defined as the threshold for statistical significance. Experiments were replicated at least three times.ResultsStriatal Proteomic Analysis of Early Adult THRSP-OE Mouse Model of ADHD-PI PresentationADHD is a complex disorder that involves the interaction of many different genes and proteins, resulting in specific behavioral characteristics. Studies have shown that manipulating a single gene or protein can impact other genes and proteins, leading to symptoms such as inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity. Our previous study suggests that the predominantly inattentive THRSP-OE mice have intrinsic impairments in the Wnt signaling pathway, as reported through hippocampal proteomics [7], which predisposes this animal model to inattention.To extend our findings, we conducted a proteomic study using the striatum in mice. The striatum is an important brain region for attention and is affected in individuals with ADHD [18]. It regulates the release of dopamine, a neurotransmitter that plays a vital role in attention, motivation, and reward. Interestingly, people with ADHD have lower levels of dopamine in the striatum, a dysfunction called “hypo-dopaminergic trait,” which may contribute to their attentional deficits [19]. Moreover, the striatum is connected to other brain regions involved in attentional processes, such as the prefrontal cortex [20]. Indeed, dysfunctions in the striatum and its connections to other brain regions can also contribute to attentional deficits in people with ADHD.In the present study, a total of 122 DEPs were identified in THRSP-OE and THRSP-KO relative to WT mice (Fig.1b; Table1) and showing 37 common DEPs. Out of these, 32 and 35 proteins were upregulated and downregulated in THRSP-OE, respectively, whereas 23 and 69 proteins were upregulated and downregulated in THRSP-KO, respectively. These findings suggest that the overexpression or knockout of the THRSP gene can have a significant intrinsic impact on the expression of other proteins in mice. Using this information, we applied the PANTHER classification system to identify the GO biological processes involved in the DEPs. GO analyses of upregulated (Fig.2a) and downregulated (Fig.2b) proteins in THRSP-OE mice identified variations in vesicle-mediated transport, cellular localization, cellular processes, and transport, among others. On the other hand, the GO analyses of upregulated (Fig.3a) and downregulated (Fig.3b) proteins in THRSP-KO mice identified involvement in the regulation of vesicle-mediated transport, localization, and biological processes, among others.These cellular and biological processes show the possibility of impaired synaptic signaling involvement, particularly with THRSP-OE mice, which could be related to the established predominant inattention observed in this ADHD mouse model [9]. However, it must be examined whether synaptic signaling is impaired in response to its transgenic nature. Therefore, using the DEPs both in the THRSP-OE and THRSP-KO mice, we conducted enrichment analysis using PANTHER pathways and identified enriched pathways, including synaptic vesicle trafficking and receptor-mediated signaling pathways (Table2), including dopamine receptor-mediated signaling pathways known to be involved in ADHD [21]. Moreover, it is interesting to observe that the thyrotropin-releasing hormone receptor signaling pathway was already identified, which further supports the role of thyroid hormone signaling in ADHD [22,23], which we previously evaluated in the same mouse model [8].Using the enriched pathways identified, we have further scrutinized what proteins were involved in the presented cellular and biological pathways, and we were intrigued to find out that most recurring sets of proteins involved were those with contributory roles in plasma membrane and synaptic vesicle regulation (Table3), particularly the Snap25 protein, a member of the family of proteins that make up the soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptors (SNARE) complex, known to have direct links to neurotransmitter regulation including dopamine [24] and previously identified to be involved in ADHD pathology both in humans [2,25,26] and animal models [27,28,29].It has been shown that the DEPs in both the THRSP-OE and THRSP-KO mice belong to the SNARE proteins, member traffic proteins, and G-proteins classification (as shown in Figs.2c, 2 d,3c, and 3 d). This indicates that the changes in the THRSP gene, especially in THRSP-OE mice, have intrinsic effects on different molecular functions and pathways, particularly transduction and signaling (as outlined in Tables4and5), among others, which may be responsible for the predominant inattention in this ADHD model.Furthermore, the total DEPs were also analyzed using STRING, showing protein–protein interaction networks restricted to high-confidence (0.9) interaction thresholds only. The protein networks from THRSP-OE and THRSP-KO mice revealed the high interaction of Snap25 (Fig.4) among other SNARE complex-related proteins. These critical findings provide evidence of differences between the two transgenic mice, particularly how Snap25 is among the five differentially regulated proteins (Table5) in THRSP-OE and THRSP-KO mice to which the THRSP-OE mice show upregulation of Snap25. In contrast, THRSP-KO mice show downregulation of this protein. Of the DEPs identified in the study, the Snap25 protein is of particular interest given its important function in the SNARE protein complex by maintaining the complex’s assembly and stability and proper synaptic transmission and brain function, if impaired, can lead to impaired neurotransmitter release (including dopamine) and eventually inducing neuropsychiatric disorders [30], such as ADHD. Overall, the current focus is on understanding how the upregulation of Snap25 affects the regulation of the SNARE protein complex and its targets and evaluating its contributory effects on the established ADHD-PI-like behaviors observed in THRSP OE mice.The Differentially Regulated Proteins in THRSP OE MiceNotably, five proteins were identified to be differentially regulated (Table6) among all DEPs, meaning that these protein levels were opposing between the two mouse groups (THRSP-OE vs THRSP-KO). For instance, we observed that Dennd4c, Snap25, and Vwf proteins were upregulated in THRSP-OE mice, while these were downregulated in THRSP-KO mice. Conversely, Dpysl3 and Gnai3 proteins were downregulated in THRSP-OE and upregulated in THRSP-KO mice. Given these findings, we analyzed the differentially regulated proteins identified in striatal proteomics with a particular focus on the THRSP-OE mice, given that this animal model has an established ADHD-PI-like behavior and is the target of the study. Therefore, at this stage, we have conducted the mRNA analysis via RT-qPCR indennd4c,snap25,dpysl3,vwf, andgnai3genes only in the ADHD-PI model, THRSP-OE mice.It is worth noting that all five differentially regulated proteins play crucial roles in nervous system function, including neurotransmission, neuronal connectivity, and blood flow regulation. Dendd4c, also known as Ras-related protein Rab-10 (Rab10), is a protein that regulates endocytosis [31], a process that helps control the number of receptors on the surface of cells, including neurons and also found to regulate dendritic branching by balancing dendritic transport [32]. Snap25 is a SNARE protein family member that plays an essential role in neurotransmitter release at the synapse [5], a process necessary for communication between neurons. Dpysl3, also known as collapsin response mediator protein 4 (Crmp4), is involved in axon guidance [33], which helps ensure proper neuronal connectivity during development. Vwf, or von Willebrand factor, is involved in blood clotting, found to promote blood–brain barrier flexibility [34]. Finally, Gnai3 is a G protein subunit (inhibitory alpha subunit) that is a component of the G protein complex (alpha, beta, and gamma subunits), which plays a crucial role in signaling pathways regulating neurotransmitter release and synaptic plasticity. As a key regulator of G protein-coupled receptor signaling, Gnai3 has been implicated in the modulation of neuronal excitability and synaptic transmission, and its dysregulation has been linked to various neurological disorders [35].Results show increased levels ofdennd4candsnap25genes in the striatum of THRSP-OE mice compared to the WT mice (Fig.5a, b). Moreover, there was a decreased expression of thedpysl3gene (Fig.5c) in the striatum of THRSP-OE mice compared to the WT mice. This shows similar trends with the expression levels of the Dendd4c, Snap25, and Dpysl3 protein levels identified in the striatal proteomics. However, while we found similarities in the expression levels of protein and genes for the three mentioned above, we failed to see significant changes in the expression levels of thevwfandgnai3genes (Fig.5d, e) in the striatum of THRSP-OE mice relative to the WT mice. Nonetheless, we found sustained expression levels of thesnap25gene which is among the most important findings in this study, given its previous involvement in ADHD pathology [4,26,27,29].The SNARE ComplexOur study has uncovered novel and sustained changes in thesnap25gene expression levels in THRSP-OE mice. This discovery prompted us to delve deeper and examine the responses of the other genes involved in the SNARE complex and voltage-dependent Ca2 + channels (VDCC). The SNARE complex and VDCC, both of which are crucial in neurotransmitter release, are formed by the interaction of several proteins, including Vamp2 (located on the vesicle membrane), Snap25, and Stx1a and Stx1b (located on the presynaptic membrane) [36]. Functionally, this complex is responsible for the docking of synaptic vesicles at the presynaptic membrane and the subsequent fusion of the vesicle membrane with the presynaptic membrane through the recruitment of necessary proteins, such as Syt1, Munc13, and Munc18, leading to neurotransmitter release into the synaptic cleft. VDCC, on the other hand, allows Ca2 + influx into the presynaptic terminal, which triggers the release of neurotransmitters by the SNARE complex.Given the innate upregulation of the Snap25 protein identified in the proteomics analysis and the resultantsnap25gene overexpression by RT-qPCR, one would assume that the SNARE complex, where this gene or protein is highly involved, may be altered. However, it is interesting that the key players in the SNARE complex, namely thestx1a,stx1b, andvamp2genes, were not significantly altered (Fig.6a, b, c). However, we only found a slightly increased expression level ofthe stx1agene but a slightly reducedstx1bgene expression level relative to the wild-type. Moreover, we found no slight changes in the expression level ofthe vamp2gene. This is a quite intriguing result given that both the Stx1b and Vamp2 proteins were among the DEPs identified in the proteomics in which both the Stx1b (STN ratio = 1.5573;p= 0.0023) and Vamp2 (STN ratio = 2.0911;p= 0.0004) proteins were upregulated relative to the wild-type (refer to Table1). The observed discrepancy between the protein and gene expression data, particularly between Stx1b protein andstx1bgene and Vamp2 protein andvamp2gene, suggests that post-transcriptional or post-translational modifications may be involved in regulating the expression or function of these proteins. Also, we observed significant reductions insyt1andmunc13genes, but themunc18gene slightly increased, though it did not reach a significance level (Fig.6d, e, f). The significant reductions insyt1andmunc13gene expression suggest that changes insnap25expression may have downstream effects on other genes involved in the SNARE complex. These reductions insyt1andmunc13gene expression could potentially lead to changes in the SNARE complex’s activity and the neurotransmitter release process. However, it is important to note that the downstream effects of changes insnap25gene expression on the function of the SNARE complex and neurotransmitter release are complex and may involve multiple genes and pathways.Furthermore, two VDCC-related genes, namelycacnb2andcacnb3genes, were overexpressed in THRSP-OE mice (Fig.6g, h). The exact mechanism by which Snap25 regulates the expression levels ofcacnb2andcacnb3genes has yet to be fully understood. However, it is thought to be since Snap25 plays a critical role in regulating VDCC and calcium-dependent neurotransmitter release. The increase in the expression levels ofcacnb2andcacnb3genes, whensnap25is overexpressed, may be a compensatory mechanism to enhance the activity of the channels and promote efficient neurotransmitter release [37].These findings underscore the complexities of the regulatory mechanisms involved in SNARE complex formation and function and the need for further studies to fully understand the molecular mechanisms underlying the observed effects ofsnap25gene overexpression in THRSP-OE mice on the SNARE complex and neurotransmitter release, particularly the dopamine. The unexpected results and the potential involvement of post-transcriptional or post-translational modifications in regulating the expression or function of these proteins further emphasize the intricacy of these processes.Dopamine Neurotransmission in THRSP-OE MiceDopamine neurotransmission plays a critical role in Snap25 function because dopamine is a key neurotransmitter in several important physiological processes, including reward, motivation, and movement. Dopamine is released into synapse by presynaptic neurons. It binds to specific receptors postsynaptic, activating downstream signaling pathways that regulate various cellular activities. The SNARE complex regulates dopamine release, which includes Snap25 as a key component [5,35]. Snap25 plays a crucial role in the synaptic vesicular docking and fusion with the presynaptic membrane, allowing dopamine release into the synapse. Therefore, changes in Snap25 expression levels can have downstream effects on dopamine neurotransmission, potentially leading to alterations in behavior. Indeed, we found a reduced dopamine D1 receptor (D1R) binding (Fig.7a) in THRSP-OE mice with no significant change in dopamine D2/D3 receptor (D2/3R) binding (Fig.7b) relative to wild-type mice. Interestingly, this reduction in D1R binding was accompanied by low dopamine levels (Fig.7c), which was rescued by methylphenidate (5 mg/kg) administration for seven days.Fig. 7The dopamine receptor mediated signaling in THRSP-OE mice. Binding affinity towards dopamine D1 receptors and D2/3 receptors were analyzed in striatal samples of THRSP-OE mice (n= 5 samples/group;aunpairedt-test:t= 13.72,df= 4,p< 0.001;bunpairedt-test:t= 0.8739,df= 4,p= 0.4315). Moreover, dopamine levels in the striatum of mice treated with MPH (5 mg/kg) for 7 days were also analyzed (n= 8 samples/group;cone-way ANOVA,F(3, 28) = 10.6,p< 0.001). Values are presented as the mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM). *p< 0.05 ***p< 0.001, by unpairedt-test relative to WT and one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple comparisons relative to vehicle (VEH)-treated WT and THRSP-OE miceFull size imageThese findings show that the reduced D1R binding and low total striatal tissue dopamine concentrations in the striatum of the THRSP-OE may be a possible result of the altered function of the SNARE complex, leading to reduced dopamine release and signaling in the brain of THRSP-OE mice, which supports the ADHD-PI-like behaviors observed in this animal model. Additionally, a reduction in tyrosine 3-monooxygenase (commonly known as tyrosine hydroxylase), the rate-limiting enzyme in dopamine biosynthesis, may contribute to decreased dopamine levels by restricting its initial synthesis from L-tyrosine, further exacerbating the effects of impaired vesicular release. Notably, both THRSP-OE and THRSP-KO mice exhibit reduced expression of tyrosine 3-monooxygenase (see Table1; DEP no. 36), with THRSP-OE mice showing a −2.2049-fold change (STN ratio), and THRSP-KO mice displaying an even more pronounced reduction (−4.2800 STN ratio). These findings suggest that THRSP dysregulation impairs dopamine synthesis regardless of whether THRSP is overexpressed or knocked out. However, it is important to note that the dopaminergic system in the brain is complex and involves multiple signaling pathways and receptors. In the case of ADHD, it has been proposed that there may be a dysfunction in the cortico-striatal networks, leading to the characteristic symptoms of the disorder [38,39,40]. Nonetheless, we have once again identified that THRSP-OE mice, an animal model for ADHD-PI, have impaired dopamine neurotransmission, as evidenced by low D1R binding and dopamine concentrations. Taken together, these results reinforce the relevance of THRSP-OE mice as a robust and mechanistically informative model for investigating the dopaminergic underpinnings of ADHDPI. However, continued investigation is warranted to fully elucidate how THRSP dysregulation alters dopamine-related molecular pathways and broader network-level processes underlying ADHD pathophysiology.EEG Changes in THRSP-OE MiceRecent studies have used EEG to measure possible changes in brain wave activity to understand better the neural mechanisms underlying ADHD [41]. In line with this approach, the current study aimed to investigate EEG changes in early adult THRSP-OE mice, an animal model of ADHD-PI. Our previous finding identified EEG changes in the same strain at four weeks, which can be considered childhood age [8]. Therefore, the primary objective of this study is to report the EEG changes in THRSP-OE mice at an early adult age, which can facilitate a better understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying ADHD pathology between two crucial stages, childhood, and adulthood.The study revealed significant findings: THRSP-OE mice exhibit innate high theta and beta waves (Fig.8a, c) compared to the wild-type control. Acute methylphenidate administration was found to reduce the theta (Fig.8b) but not beta waves (Fig.8d) in mice. Interestingly, there were no changes in the theta and beta waves between THRSP-OE and wild-type mice during the 7 th day recording (Fig.8e, g). Equally intriguing, there were no changes in theta or beta waves in the THRSP-OE mice between acute and repeated (7 days) dose of 5 mg/kg of methylphenidate administrations (Fig.8f, h), although a slightly reduced theta and beta waves were observed, respectively, but failed to reach significance level. It is worth noting that our EEG study involved administering varying doses of methylphenidate (2, 5, and 10 mg/kg), but we primarily focused on the 5 mg/kg dose, as it was the only dose that yielded a significant difference between WT and THRSP-OE mice in our analysis. This finding is consistent with our previous research [6], which demonstrated that MPH administration at a dose of 5 mg/kg improves inattention and striatal dopamine-related gene (i.e., dopamine transporter, tyrosine hydroxylase, D1R, and D2R) expression in THRSP-OE mice. However, 7 days of methylphenidate administration increased the EEG peaks in THRSP-OE mice (Fig.8l), which is an important finding. A representative frequency band was also shown (Fig.8m). The observation of increased EEG peaks in THRSP-OE mice following 7 days of methylphenidate administration suggests that 5 mg/kg of methylphenidate may have a positive effect on the neural activity in THRSP-OE mice. This result is consistent with the known effects of methylphenidate on increasing neural activity and improving cognitive function in individuals with ADHD [42,43]. Moreover, the theta and beta waves during the 1st and 7th day following methylphenidate administration (Fig.8i, j) did not induce significant changes. However, the observation of reduced TBR is a significant finding in this ADHD-PI mouse model following 7 days of methylphenidate administration (Fig.8k). Further, findings on the effects of methylphenidate in WT mice can also be found in Supplementary Fig.1.Fig. 8The EEG measurements (theta, beta) in THRSP-OE mice exposed to acute and repeated MPH (5 mg/kg). Mice (n= 6 samples/group) were monitored in an EEG apparatus after single (1 day) VEH and MPH administrationsaTheta ((WT (VEH) × THRSP-OE (VEH); unpairedt-test,t= 3.23,df= 5,p= 0.023);bTheta ((THRSP (VEH) × THRSP-OE (MPH); unpairedt-test,t= 5.05,df= 5,p= 0.004);cBeta ((WT (VEH) × THRSP-OE (VEH); unpairedt-test,t= 2.76,df= 5,p= 0.040);dBeta ((THRSP (VEH) × THRSP-OE (VEH); unpairedt-test,t= 2.22,df= 5,p= 0.077), the repeated (7 days) VEH and MPH administrations;eTheta ((WT (VEH) × THRSP-OE (VEH); unpairedt-test,t= 109,df= 5,p= 0.918);fTheta ((THRSP (VEH) × THRSP-OE (MPH); unpairedt-test,t= 0.645,df= 5,p= 0.547);gBeta ((WT (VEH) × THRSP-OE (VEH); unpairedt-test,t= 0.0652,df= 5,p= 0.951);hBeta ((THRSP (VEH) × THRSP-OE (VEH); unpairedt-test,t= 0.767,df= 5,p= 0.478), and the comparison between 1 and 7 days of MPH effects in the EEG of THRSP-OE miceiTheta (THRSP-OE (MPH) (1 day × 7 days); pairedt-test,t= 1.38,df= 5,p= 0.227);jBeta (THRSP-OE (MPH) (1 day × 7 days); pairedt-test,t= 1.28,df= 5,p= 0.256);kTheta/Beta ratio (THRSP-OE (MPH) (1 day × 7 days); pairedt-test,t= 2.72,df= 5,p= 0.042).lEEG peaks were also analyzed in THRSP-OE MPH-treated mice (1 day × 7 days); pairedt-test,t= 3.71,df= 5,p= 0.014) andmgraphical representations of the EEG amplitudes are also presented. Values are presented as the mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM). *p< 0.05 and **p< 0.01, by unpairedt-test relative to treatment and pairedt-test for day effectsFull size imageThe TBR, a reliable measure of ADHD, is diagnosed based on the presence of a higher TBR in individuals with ADHD as compared to those without the disorder [17]. This ratio also resembles the pre-methylphenidate TBR in THRSP-OE mice (Fig.8k), indicating the potential for improvements in TBR in this ADHD-PI animal model following 7 days of methylphenidate administration, a first-line drug for ADHD, a result supported by prior studies on the improvement of EEG spectral powers in children and adults with ADHD [44,45]. In 2013, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the use of EEG-based methods to diagnose ADHD, such as the Neuropsychiatric EEG-Based Assessment Aid (NEBA) System [46], a noninvasive neurophysiological scan test that gauges an increased brain oscillatory TBR in ADHD. These implications underscore the potential of our findings in advancing the understanding and treatment of ADHD.Furthermore, our findings suggest that the THRSP-OE mouse model may be a useful tool for investigating the neural mechanisms underlying ADHD and the effects of methylphenidate administration and could potentially be used to inform the development of more effective treatments for ADHD in humans. The theta waves are associated with daydreaming and inattention, while beta waves are associated with focus and attention. Therefore, a higher ratio of theta to beta waves indicates greater inattention (and distractibility), a hallmark symptom of ADHD, and the specific symptom established and modeled by the THRSP-OE mice, an ADHD-PI animal model.DiscussionThis extension study conducted in THRSP-OE mice, an ADHD-PI model, yielded some important results. Previous hippocampal proteomics studies indicated the involvement of the Wnt signaling pathway [7], and the current findings suggest potential dysfunctions in signal transduction and signaling due to possible impaired SNARE complex. This possible impairment in the SNARE complex may be attributed to the upregulation of the Snap25 protein found in the proteomics and the subsequent overexpression of thesnap25gene observed. This innate overexpression of Snap25, a protein that is involved in regulating neurotransmitter release and is linked to ADHD [2] due to its involvement in dopamine signaling [5], maybe a contributing factor to the ADHD-PI-like behavior observed in THRSP-OE mice.The research findings presented in this study shed light on the role of Snap25 protein orsnap25gene expressions in the development of ADHD, which are consistent with previous studies in animal models and observations from mutations in Snap25 in humans, indicating that this protein plays a crucial role in inducing ADHD-like symptoms in animal models [28,29] and ADHD in humans [2,3,5,26,27].One such animal model is the Coloboma mutant (Cm/+) mouse, which is a highly validated ADHD transgenic mouse model [47] that was developed from neutron irradiation bearing a deletion mutation on chromosome 2, functionally disrupting approximately 20 genes, includingsnap25[4]. This mouse model was observed to have hyperactivity, inattention, and impulsivity due to the functional deletion of thesnap25gene. However, when a transgene encoding snap25 was bred into the coloboma strain to complement the snap25 deletion, the ADHD symptoms expressed by these mice were rescued, returning their behaviors to normal levels as control [28]. This observation indicates the critical role of Snap25 protein in regulating neuronal activity and its potential implications in neuropsychiatric disorders like ADHD.Interestingly, in another study [48], dopamine release in the dorsal striatum of the Cm/+ mouse was completely blocked, suggesting involvement in ADHD symptoms, particularly in the learning deficits observed in these mutants. This is quite an interesting comparison with THRSP-OE and Cm/+ mice since both have aberrant expressions of Snap25, in which the THRSP-OE mice were found to have upregulated Snap25 protein (orsnap25gene) while the Cm/+ mice were found to have non-functioningsnap25gene. However, while both have contrasting Snap25 expression levels, they share dysfunctional dopaminergic neurotransmission due to low DA levels in the striatum. While the Cm/+ mouse model has a non-functioningsnap25gene, the THRSP-OE mouse model has upregulated Snap25 protein. This difference insnap25expression levels may indicate distinct underlying mechanisms for ADHD-like symptoms in these two models, warranting further investigation into the role of Snap25.As previously mentioned, Snap25 is crucial in various enriched pathways, as shown in Table3. These pathways range from synaptic vesicle trafficking to dopamine receptor-mediated signaling and thyrotropin-releasing hormone receptor signaling. This observation highlights the significant role of Snap25 proteins in these vital functions and may explain why the THRSP-OE mice behave as they do.Of note, thyroid hormone (consisting of triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4)) plays a crucial role in a variety of physiological processes. In particular, the brain, as part of the central nervous system, is a key target of thyroid hormones, which regulate neuronal cell proliferation, migration, and synaptogenesis [49]. Disruptions in thyroid hormone levels (such as hypothyroidism and GRTH) during fetal and postnatal periods can lead to developmental delays [50]. Furthermore, hypothyroidism in adulthood can cause neuronal network abnormalities, resulting in significant behavioral and neurological defects such as memory impairment and inattention [51]. Notably, several psychiatric disorders have been linked to TH abnormalities, including attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) [52].The THRSP-OE mice are models with overexpressed thyroid hormone-responsive protein (THRSP), a cofactor for thyroid hormone receptor beta (TRβ)-dependent transcriptional activation of specific gene targets [53]. This suggests that THRSP may modulate TRβ function downstream of the thyroid hormone response elements (TRE). However, it remains unclear how THRSP overexpression affects Snap25. Interestingly, a previous study has shown that thyroid hormone regulates the expression of Snap25 during rat brain development [54]. The study used microarray analysis and demonstrated that the Snap25 protein andsnap25gene were down-regulated in the developing hypothyroid rat brain, indicating that hypothyroidism causes decreased Snap25 expression. This finding may account for the impaired brain development seen in hypothyroidism.The findings of our study are particularly intriguing, as they suggest that there may be an interplay between Snap25, THRSP, and thyroid hormone signaling in the brain. This is highlighted by the fact that THRSP-OE mice have brain-specific (striatal) T3 deficiency [8], despite normal levels of circulating thyroid hormones, which raises important questions about the role of these genes in neural function, particularly in this mouse model of ADHD-PI. Nonetheless, our research indicates that the overexpression of THRSP in THRSP-OE mice leads to an innate overexpression of the striatal Snap25 protein. This, in turn, may cause downstream effects on multiple genes, pathways, and cellular functions, such as the SNARE complex and neurotransmitter release, leading to impaired dopamine signaling, as evidenced by low D1R binding and dopamine levels. These changes may also have contributed to altered EEG patterns observed in THRSP-OE mice, which were improved by methylphenidate administration. The upregulation of SNAP25 and other SNARE and VDCC-related genes in THRSP-OE mice may seem to contradict the expected increase in dopamine transmission. However, our findings suggest that the significant reductions in syt1 and munc13 gene expression may have downstream effects on the SNARE complex’s activity and the neurotransmitter release process, potentially leading to decreased dopamine transmission. This is consistent with the observed discrepancy between the protein and gene expression data, suggesting that post-transcriptional or post-translational modifications may be involved in regulating the expression or function of these proteins. Further studies are needed to fully understand the molecular mechanisms underlying the observed effects of snap25 gene overexpression in THRSP-OE mice on the SNARE complex and neurotransmitter release, particularly dopamine.Our findings also suggest that the changes in dopamine receptor-mediated signaling in THRSP-OE mice may be related to the altered expression of Snap25 and other proteins involved in this pathway, which could potentially affect dopamine levels and neurotransmission. The reduction in tyrosine 3-monooxygenase (Th) levels in THRSP-OE mice, as shown in Table3, further supports this idea. Th, also known as tyrosine hydroxylase, is an enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of dopamine, and its reduced expression in THRSP-OE mice may contribute to the impaired dopamine signaling observed in these mice. These findings highlight the complex interplay between Snap25, Th, and other proteins involved in dopamine receptor-mediated signaling, and suggest that further studies are needed to fully understand the mechanisms underlying these changes.However, it is important to note that there are limitations to this study that must be considered when interpreting our findings. Specifically, while we observed alterations in dopamine levels and SNARE protein expression, we did not directly assess dopamine release or turnover in THRSP-OE mice. As such, while the observed changes in dopamine signaling are consistent with our hypothesis, the lack of direct measurement of dopamine release limits the ability to conclusively determine the impact of Snap25 overexpression on dopamine neurotransmission. The proposed mechanisms linking altered SNARE function and dopamine signaling remain speculative and will require further experimental validation. Future studies that directly measure dopamine release, eitherin vivoorex vivo, or assess dopamine turnover, will be essential to confirm these findings and clarify the molecular mechanisms involved.Furthermore, research has shown that ADHD is associated with changes in both neurotransmitter activity and EEG patterns. Poor dopaminergic signaling is believed to be a key contributing factor to these changes, as dopamine plays a crucial role in regulating attention, movement, and motivation. In individuals with ADHD, there is often a reduction in dopamine levels, which can lead to difficulties in paying attention and regulating behavior. Studies have shown that there are characteristic EEG patterns associated with ADHD, including increased TBR, which may be related to the underlying neurotransmitter imbalances in ADHD.Overall, our findings underscore the complex interplay between gene/protein factors, neurotransmitter systems, and neural cicuitry in THRSP-OE mice, a valuable model for ADHD-PI. These results emphasize the potential role of THRSP dysregulation in modulating dopamine-related mechanisms and synaptic function underlying ADHD-like behaviors. Continued research is needed to further clarify the role of THRSP and associated pathways in ADHD pathophysiology and to leverage the THRSP-OE model in the development of more targeted and effective therapeutic strategies, particularly for adults affected by this disorder.Data AvailabilityProteomics data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD051619.ReferencesAmerican Psychiatric Association (2013) Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders (Fifth ed.), vol 5.
