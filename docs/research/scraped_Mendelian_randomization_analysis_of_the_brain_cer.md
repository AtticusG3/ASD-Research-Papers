## Abstract

The need for new therapeutics for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is evident. Brain, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and plasma protein biomarkers with causal genetic evidence could represent potential drug targets. However, a comprehensive screen of the proteome has not yet been conducted.
We employed a three-pronged approach using Mendelian Randomization (MR) and Bayesian colocalization analysis. Firstly, we studied 608 brains, 214 CSF, and 612 plasma proteins as potential causal mediators of ADHD using MR analysis. Secondly, we analysed the consistency of the discovered biomarkers across three distinct subtypes of ADHD: childhood, persistent, and late-diagnosed ADHD. Finally, we extended our analysis to examine the correlation between identified biomarkers and Tourette syndrome and pervasive autism spectrum disorder (ASD), conditions often linked with ADHD. To validate the MR findings, we conducted sensitivity analysis. Additionally, we performed cell type analysis on the human brain to identify risk genes that are notably enriched in various brain cell types.
After applying Bonferroni correction, we found that the risk of ADHD was increased by brain proteins GMPPB, NAA80, HYI, CISD2, and HYI, TIE1 in CSF and plasma. Proteins GMPPB, NAA80, ICA1L, CISD2, TIE1, and RMDN1 showed overlapped loci with ADHD risk through Bayesian colocalization. Overexpression of GMPPB protein was linked to an increase in the risk for all three ADHD subtypes. While ICA1L provided protection against both ASD and ADHD, CISD2 increased the probability of both disorders. Cell-specific studies revealed that GMPPB, NAA80, ICA1L, and CISD2 were predominantly present on the surface of excitatory-inhibitory neurons.
Our comprehensive MR investigation of the brain, CSF, and plasma proteomes revealed seven proteins with causal connections to ADHD. Particularly, GMPPB and TIE1 emerged as intriguing targets for potential ADHD therapy.
