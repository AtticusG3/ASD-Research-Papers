Each membrane serves unique functions; the outer membrane (OM) is relatively permeable, whereas the inner membrane (IM) hosts a plethora of mitochondrial carriers (MCs) or mitochondrial transporters (MTs). These transporters are crucial for the selective translocation of metabolites, ions, and cofactors, ensuring the integrity of the mitochondrial inner membrane (MIM) [2]. The oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) system, located within this membrane, is the principal pathway for cellular energy production, synthesizing adenosine triphosphate (ATP) utilizing oxygen [3]. The precise regulation of these transport processes is vital for optimal mitochondrial functionality and overall cellular health.MCs are categorized into various families based on their structure, functional roles, and the specific substrates they transport. One prominent group is the MC family 25 (SLC25 family), which includes diverse carriers involved in the shuttling of critical metabolites such as carboxylic acids, nucleotides, and amino acids. Other specialized families facilitate the transport of molecules essential for metabolic processes like fatty acid import or phosphate transport [2,4,5]. Structurally, MCs typically contain six transmembrane α-helices arranged in a threefold pseudo-symmetrical manner, with substrate-binding sites oriented toward both the cytosolic and matrix sides. This architecture allows the carrier to alternate between inward- and outward-facing conformations, facilitating efficient and highly specific substrate exchange [6,7]. Such conformational shifts are tightly regulated and essential for maintaining TCA (tricarboxylic acid) cycle activity and MR across the mitochondrial inner membrane.Disruptions in MC function have been implicated in numerous human diseases [8]. Genetic mutations affecting MCs can disrupt metabolic transport, impair energy production, and precipitate mitochondrial diseases [9]. Additionally, such dysfunctions contribute to the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders, including Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s diseases, where compromised substrate transport in neurons is a key factor [8,10]. Dysregulation in MC activity can also lead to MR imbalances, such as those seen in T2D and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) [5]. Recent studies have emphasized the link between specific MCs and disease phenotypes. For example, SLC25A33, a pyrimidine nucleotide transporter, is crucial for mitochondrial DNA and RNA synthesis. Deficiency in this carrier can disrupt nucleotide homeostasis, undermining mitochondrial gene expression and respiratory capacity [11,12]. Similarly, mutations in SLC25A20 (carnitine/acylcarnitine translocase) lead to severe energy production defects, illustrating how structure-guided substrate transport is foundational to health [13].Furthermore, altered mitochondrial metabolism is a recognized characteristic of cancer, and understanding MC functions in tumor cells could unveil new therapeutic targets [14,15]. Active research is directed towards the development of specific drugs targeting MCs, which could offer new treatment avenues for diseases associated with mitochondrial dysfunction [4,16]. Understanding how MC activity is regulated by other cellular signals is crucial for devising effective therapeutic strategies [14].However, mitochondria also possess the capability for Metabolic reprogramming (MR), a process allowing adaptation of their metabolic pathways to meet cellular demands. This adaptability is essential for normal cellular functions but can contribute to disease pathogenesis if dysregulated [17]. MR in cells enables adaptation to varying conditions such as nutrient availability and oxygen levels. For instance, in glucose-rich conditions, cells may favor aerobic respiration via OXPHOS, whereas under oxygen or glucose scarcity, they might switch to anaerobic glycolysis [4]. This metabolic flexibility is crucial for maintaining energy homeostasis under diverse environmental conditions.However, several diseases are associated with disruptions in mitochondrial MR. The “Warburg effect,” often observed in cancer cells, illustrates a shift towards aerobic glycolysis, facilitating rapid proliferation even in the presence of oxygen [18]. Similarly, diseases like Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s involve mitochondrial dysfunctions due to the high energy demands of neurons, where inadequate ATP production through impaired reprogramming contributes to neurodegeneration [16,19]. Additionally, conditions such as T2D and NAFLD can disrupt mitochondrial metabolic pathways, leading to energy production imbalances and disease progression [20].Elucidating the mechanisms by which MC dysfunction contributes to pathological MR is imperative for developing effective and disease-specific therapeutic strategies. Identifying biomarkers associated with specific reprogramming patterns will aid in diagnostics and monitoring therapeutic responses. By unraveling the intricacies of the function of MCs, researchers aim to forge novel treatment strategies for various diseases impacting human health [16,21]. Despite the challenges in developing specific and effective drugs targeting MTs, advancements in drug discovery, delivery systems, and systems biology are pivotal for harnessing the full therapeutic potential of MTs [22]. This review encompasses various facets, including types of MR associated with major diseases, mechanisms of development and prevention of MR, impacts of MT dysfunction, and the use of compounds targeting MTs and MR for disease treatment.Types of metabolic reprogramming (MR) for major diseasesCells, the fundamental units of life, rely on a complex network of biochemical pathways to function, collectively known as metabolism [23]. This intricate network includes processes such as energy (ATP) production, biosynthesis, and redox balance. Disruptions in these pathways can drive the onset and progression of multiple diseases [24]. The remarkable ability of cells to adapt their metabolic pathways is termed metabolic reprogramming (MR) [25]. While MR is an essential adaptive mechanism under stress or nutrient limitations, its pathological activation contributes to disease states [26].Metabolic reprogramming (MR) in cancerCancer cells exploit MR to fuel uncontrolled growth, survival, and invasion. Key reprogrammed pathways include aerobic glycolysis, glutaminolysis, lipid metabolism, the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), and mitochondrial biogenesis [25].Aerobic glycolysis in cancer cellsAerobic glycolysis, also known as the Warburg effect, is a hallmark of cancer metabolism. In this process, cancer cells ferment glucose into lactate, even in the presence of sufficient oxygen [18]. While less efficient for ATP generation compared to oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), aerobic glycolysis provides several advantages for cancer cells. It enables rapid ATP production, supports biosynthesis, and maintains the redox state by regenerating nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD⁺) [27,28]. This shift fuels proliferation and enhances survival, making it a key feature of tumor MR.Glutaminolysis in cancer cellsThe metabolization of glutamine, known as glutaminolysis, has become a crucial aspect of cancer metabolism. It fuels the growth and survival of many cancers by providing key nutrients and precursors for various cellular processes [29,30]. Through mitochondrial glutaminase (GLS), glutamine is converted to glutamate, feeding into the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and supporting biosynthesis and redox homeostasis. This highlights glutamine as a major driver of MR in cancer cells [31].Lipid metabolism in cancer cellsCancer cells exhibit a distinct metabolic profile compared to healthy cells. A key hallmark of the reprogramming is the altered regulation of lipid metabolism, which plays a crucial role in supporting tumor growth, invasion, and metastasis [32]. Generally, cancer cells display a sensitive demand for fatty acids, which serve as essential building blocks for cell membranes and fuel sources for rapid proliferation [33]. The increased demand is met through various altered pathways. Unlike normal cells that primarily rely on dietary fats, cancer cells often exhibit increased de novo lipogenesis, the synthesis of fatty acids from glucose and other precursors [34]. This allows them to generate the necessary lipids for building membranes and signaling molecules. Cancer cells upregulate fatty acid transporters to import more lipids from the surrounding environment [35]. This can be particularly detrimental in tumors with access to a rich lipid supply, such as those in adipose tissue. Lastly, cancer cells, to fuel their rapid growth and survival, often exhibit altered cholesterol metabolism. This includes increased uptake or synthesis of cholesterol, a molecule crucial for maintaining membrane integrity and signaling pathways [36].Interestingly, the altered lipid metabolism in cancer goes beyond just providing building materials. Fatty acids serve as signaling molecules, influencing processes like cell proliferation, migration, and resistance to therapy [33]. Additionally, some cancers utilize lipids as a primary energy source, particularly in conditions with limited glucose availability [37]. Briefly, lipid metabolism plays a critical role in supporting the growth and survival of cancer cells. Understanding the specific alterations in lipid pathways within different cancers will be crucial for developing targeted therapies.Pentose phosphate pathway in cancer cellsThe pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), also known as the phosphogluconate pathway, is a non-glycolytic route for glucose metabolism that plays a vital role in cancer cell proliferation and survival [38]. Unlike glycolysis, the primary function of the PPP is not to generate ATP (cellular energy) but to produce essential precursors for various biosynthetic processes [39]. These precursors include nucleotides, which are required for deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and ribonucleic acid (RNA) synthesis, as well as ribose-5-phosphate, which is the backbone of nucleotides and essential for building nucleic acids [39]. Rapidly dividing cancer cells have a sensitive demand for nucleotides to support their increased DNA and RNA replication. The PPP plays a critical role in fulfilling the demand by providing the necessary ribose-5-phosphate precursors [40]. Additionally, the PPP generates nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH), a reducing agent essential for maintaining redox balance within the cell and protecting against oxidative stress, which can damage DNA and hinder cell survival [41].As a result, cancer cells frequently rely on PPP due to their altered metabolic state. The Warburg effect, a hallmark of cancer, describes the shift towards aerobic glycolysis even in the presence of oxygen. This can limit the availability of precursors for PPPs through the main glycolytic pathway [18]. To compensate, cancer cells can upregulate the PPP to ensure a sufficient supply of nucleotides and maintain redox homeostasis [39]. Presently, the pentose phosphate pathway plays a crucial role in supporting the biosynthetic needs and redox balance of cancer cells. Understanding the specific regulation of the PPP in different cancers is essential for developing effective therapeutic strategies.Mitochondrial biogenesis in cancer cellsMitochondria, the powerhouses of the cell, play a critical role in cancer biology [42]. Their ability to adapt and increase in number, a process known as mitochondrial biogenesis, is essential for supporting the elevated metabolic demands of cancer cells [43]. Cancer cells exhibit a distinct metabolic profile compared to healthy cells. They often rely on aerobic glycolysis, even in the presence of oxygen, to meet their energy needs, a phenomenon known as the Warburg effect [44]. However, cancer cells also require a functional mitochondrial network for various functions. First and foremost, the primary function of mitochondria is to generate cellular energy through oxidative phosphorylation, a process that requires a sufficient number of mitochondria [43]. Next, mitochondria contribute to the synthesis of essential molecules like amino acids, nucleotides, and fatty acids, all crucial for cancer cell growth and proliferation [45]. To conclude, mitochondria play a role in maintaining cellular redox homeostasis by regulating reactive oxygen species levels, which can damage DNA and hinder cell survival [46].To meet these delicate demands, cancer cells activate mitochondrial biogenesis pathways. This entails the coordinated upregulation of genes and signaling cascades that promote mitochondrial protein replication and import, ultimately leading to an increase in mitochondrial number and function [43]. In short, mitochondrial biogenesis is a critical adaptation that allows cancer cells to meet their delicate metabolic demands [44]. Understanding the intricate signaling pathways that regulate this process is crucial for developing effective therapeutic strategies.MR in neurodegenerative diseasesNeurodegenerative diseases (NDDs) are a class of progressive disorders characterized by the loss of neurons and a decline in cognitive function [47]. While the specific causes vary between different NDDs like Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and Huntington's disease (HD), there is growing evidence that MR, a shift in cellular metabolism to meet altered demands, plays a key role in the pathogenesis of these disorders [48].Impaired glucose metabolismNeurons primarily rely on glucose for energy production via oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) in healthy brains. However, in neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease, there is a decrease in glucose uptake and utilization by neurons [49,50]. This can be due to impaired insulin signaling or defects in glucose transporters. The resulting energy deficit further contributes to neuronal dysfunction and death [51].Mitochondrial dysfunction and dysregulation of amino acid metabolismMitochondria, the cellular powerhouses, are often dysfunctional in neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease [52]. This dysfunction can be due to genetic mutations, oxidative stress, or protein aggregates. It disrupts oxidative phosphorylation, the primary energy production pathway in neurons, leading them to rely more on inefficient aerobic glycolysis for energy [53,54]. Neurodegenerative diseases can also involve changes in amino acid metabolism, such as glutamate. In some cases, excess glutamate can lead to excitotoxicity, a process that causes neuronal damage. At present, MR is an important factor in the development and progression of NDDs. Understanding the specific metabolic alterations in each NDD can pave the way for the development of novel therapeutic strategies to restore neuronal function and slow disease progression.MR in metabolic disordersMetabolic disorders encompass a diverse group of conditions characterized by disruptions in how the body processes nutrients and maintains energy balance [55]. These disruptions often involve alterations in various metabolic pathways, prompting cells to adapt through a process known as MR. Understanding these adaptations is crucial for developing targeted therapies for metabolic disorders [56].Substrate utilization shifts and macronutrient reprogrammingFirst of all, insulin resistance, a hallmark of type 2 diabetes, impairs glucose uptake by muscle and adipose tissues. This forces the body to rely more on fatty acid oxidation for energy, potentially leading to ectopic fat accumulation and further complications [57]. In addition, genetic disorders can disrupt the breakdown of specific nutrients. For example, a deficiency in the enzyme propionyl-CoA carboxylase causes propionic acidemia, leading to a buildup of propionic acid. To compensate, cells may adapt by utilizing alternative energy substrates, such as ketones [58,59]. Next, in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), excessive fat accumulation occurs in the liver. Simple steatosis, a relatively benign condition, can range to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, a more severe form involving inflammation and fibrosis [60]. MR is a central concept in NAFLD/NASH pathogenesis [61]. NAFLD disturbs the balance of fat breakdown for energy in a healthy liver, leading to increased fat synthesis and impaired fatty acid oxidation [62]. This leads to progressive fat accumulation in the liver and liver damage [60].Epigenetic reprogramming and disrupted bile acid synthesisEpigenetics refers to modifications that influence gene expression without altering the DNA sequence itself. NAFLD is associated with epigenetic changes that promote fat storage and inflammation [63]. Changes in gene expression patterns caused by DNA methylation and histone acetylation can influence metabolic pathways [63]. Bile acids are crucial for fat digestion and absorption. NAFLD alters bile acid synthesis, potentially leading to further fat accumulation and liver damage [64]. These metabolic changes not only lead to fat buildup but also trigger inflammatory responses and oxidative stress, promoting the progression of NAFLD to NASH [65].Mitochondrial dysfunction and MRMitochondrial dysfunction is a common feature in many metabolic disorders, impacting cellular respiration and ATP generation. This can trigger compensatory mechanisms, such as increased aerobic glycolysis, which is a less efficient but faster energy-producing pathway to meet energy demands [54]. NAFLD also causes mitochondrial dysfunction, further impairing fat breakdown and contributing to cellular stress, which promotes inflammation [66]. Impaired mitochondrial function in type 2 diabetes (T2D) disrupts energy metabolism and contributes to insulin resistance [67].Increased gluconeogenesis and impaired insulin signalingThis refers to the liver's production of glucose from non-carbohydrate sources like amino acids and lactate. In diabetes, gluconeogenesis is abnormally elevated, further contributing to hyperglycemia [68]. Insulin is a key hormone that regulates blood sugar levels by promoting glucose uptake into cells [69]. Diabetes disrupts insulin signaling pathways, resulting in decreased glucose uptake by muscle and fat tissues. These metabolic changes not only cause hyperglycemia but also contribute to other diabetic complications, such as nephropathy, neuropathy, and retinopathy [70,71]. In conclusion, MR plays a significant role in the pathogenesis of various metabolic disorders. Understanding these adaptations and developing targeted therapies based on the specific metabolic forms of each condition can potentially improve treatment strategies and promote metabolic health.MR in autoimmune diseasesAutoimmune diseases arise when the immune system mistakenly attacks healthy tissues. Recent research highlights a crucial role for MR, the cellular rewiring of energy metabolism, in the development and progression of these conditions [72,73]. A key feature of this reprogramming is the switch from oxidative phosphorylation, the primary pathway for ATP generation in healthy cells, to aerobic glycolysis. This less efficient process relies on glucose breakdown for energy, even in the presence of oxygen [18]. Immune cells, such as T lymphocytes, experience rapid proliferation and inflammatory activity as a result of this metabolic shift, which promotes tissue damage in autoimmune diseases [74]. This change in metabolism helps immune cells like macrophages and synovial fibroblasts multiply quickly and become inflamed. These cells damage joints in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and T and B lymphocytes play an important role in the development of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) pathogenesis [74,75,76].Mitochondrial dysfunction and reactive oxygen species (ROS)Mitochondria, besides generating energy, also produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) as a byproduct. While ROS play a signaling role, excessive mitochondrial ROS (mtROS) production can damage cellular components and contribute to inflammation [77]. Various autoimmune diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus and RA, show increased mtROS levels, suggesting that mitochondrial dysfunction may be a driver of autoimmune responses [78].Immune cell specificity and MRDifferent immune cell types exhibit specific MR that can influence their function in autoimmunity. Improved utilization of glutamine could facilitate the expansion of autoreactive plasmablasts in B cells, potentially causing antibody-induced tissue damage [79,80]. In SLE, T cells increase aerobic glycolysis and make more autoantibodies that attack healthy tissues. B cells, on the other hand, increase aerobic glycolysis to help them change into plasma cells that make antibodies [81,82]. Macrophages in the RA synovium exhibit enhanced aerobic glycolysis and increased production of pro-inflammatory cytokines like interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α). In addition, mitochondrial dysfunction in macrophages can lead to deficiencies in adenine nicotinamide (NAD+) and aspartate, which are essential for T cell function [74,83]. This disrupts the normal immune response and promotes chronic inflammation. Synovial fibroblasts become activated in RA and exhibit enhanced glycolysis and fatty acid synthesis, contributing to joint destruction [83]. Understanding how MR fuels autoimmunity can lead to the development of novel therapeutic strategies. Targeting these metabolic pathways, or mtROS production, could offer new ways to regulate immune cell function, inhibit inflammation, and potentially slow disease progression [84].MR in cardiovascular diseasesCardiovascular diseases (CVDs) encompass a range of conditions affecting the heart and blood vessels. Emerging research suggests that MR, a shift in cellular metabolism to meet altered demands, plays a crucial role in the development and progression of CVDs [85]. This concept challenges the traditional view of CVDs as solely diseases of the circulatory system, highlighting the intricate interplay between cellular metabolism and heart health [86]. The main CVDs where MR plays a significant role include coronary artery disease (CAD), heart failure (HF), myocardial infarction (MI), and atherosclerosis [87].Shift from oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) to glycolysisConventionally, healthy cardiomyocytes (heart muscle cells) primarily rely on oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), a process that efficiently generates cellular energy using oxygen and fatty acids [88]. However, under CVD pathological conditions, cardiomyocytes undergo a metabolic switch towards aerobic glycolysis, a less efficient process that breaks down glucose for energy even in the presence of oxygen [88,89]. Numerous factors, such as mitochondrial dysfunction, nutrient deprivation, insulin resistance, and inflammatory signals, are believed to drive this metabolic switch [89].Cardiomyocytes in CVDs experience mitochondrial dysfunction, which compels them to rely on alternative energy production pathways such as glycolysis [90]. The byproducts of glycolysis, such as lactate, can accumulate in failing hearts and contribute to cellular stress, inflammation, and ultimately, cell death [91]. Additionally, mitochondrial dysfunction may lead to increased production of ROS that damage cells [77]. On the other hand, nutrient deficiency may lead to reduced availability of fatty acids, the preferred fuel source for healthy cardiomyocytes, and further trigger a switch to glucose dependence [89]. Moreover, impaired insulin signaling can limit glucose uptake into other tissues, leading to increased glucose availability for the heart and promoting glycolysis [92].MR in different cell typesMetabolic alterations occur not only in cardiomyocytes but also in other cell types within the heart, such as endothelial cells and immune cells [93]. These changes contribute to inflammation, fibrosis, and plaque formation, all key players in CVD progression [94]. It is important to note that MR is not solely responsible for CVDs. It interacts with other risk factors, such as genetics, lifestyle, and inflammation [95]. However, understanding this metabolic shift holds immense potential for developing novel therapeutic strategies to improve patient outcomes.Development and preventive mechanism for MRLiving organisms exhibit a remarkable capacity to adapt their metabolism to meet physiological demands. This dynamic process, known as metabolic reprogramming (MR), involves alterations in cellular pathways and substrate utilization to optimize energy production and biosynthesis for specific needs [96]. MR plays a critical role in various physiological processes, including development, differentiation, and immune response [97]. However, dysregulation of these pathways can contribute to the development of chronic diseases like cancer, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease [98]. This research area focuses on two key aspects, such as the development and preventive mechanisms for MR. By elucidating the intricate mechanisms of MR and developing preventive strategies, researchers hope to pave the way for novel therapeutic interventions for a wide range of diseases [55].Development mechanisms for MRMR arises through coordinated alterations in nutrient sensing, signaling pathways, and mitochondrial function, enabling cells to adapt their bioenergetic and biosynthetic processes in response to developmental signals and pathological stressors [25]. This review would delve into the key mechanisms that orchestrate these metabolic shifts.Signaling pathwaysSignaling pathways play a critical role in MR, acting as the communication network between the environment, nutrient availability, and the cellular metabolic machinery. These pathways are frequently activated by growth factors, hypoxia (low oxygen), and oncogenic mutations [99]. Phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), and hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) pathways are some of the signaling pathways that change metabolism in response to growth factors and nutrient availability [100]. These pathways regulate the expression of enzymes and transporters involved in various metabolic processes [101].PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway in MRThe phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway is a key signaling cascade that plays a critical role in orchestrating MR [102]. Various growth factors and oncogenic mutations activate the PI3K pathway. Upon activation, PI3K phosphorylates phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) to phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3). PIP3 acts as a second messenger, recruiting and activating downstream signaling molecules like Akt (serine/threonine protein kinase) and the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). This activation cascade ultimately leads to increased protein synthesis, cell growth, and proliferation [103].The PI3K pathway significantly influences cellular metabolism in several ways. First of all, the PI3K pathway stimulates glucose uptake and aerobic glycolysis, even in oxygen-rich environments. This allows cancer cells to generate energy and intermediate metabolites needed for biosynthesis [99]. Next, PI3K signaling can influence glutamine metabolism, facilitating its conversion into tricarboxylic acid (TCA) and supporting other biosynthetic pathways [30]. Moreover, the PI3K pathway promotes lipogenesis—the synthesis of fatty acids and triglycerides. This allows cells to store excess nutrients and provides energy reserves for rapid proliferation [32]. Various cancers frequently exhibit mutations in the PI3K pathway. These mutations lead to constitutive activation of the pathway, promoting uncontrolled cell growth and MR that fuel tumorigenesis [104]. The PI3K pathway is a critical regulator of tumor cell proliferation, survival, and metabolism, making it an important target for cancer therapy. Several PI3K inhibitors have demonstrated clinical benefit in malignancies such as breast cancer, lymphoma, and leukemia. However, their therapeutic utility is often challenged by off-target toxicities and the development of resistance mechanisms [105]. Beyond inhibiting oncogenic signaling, PI3K inhibitors may also disrupt the metabolism reprogramming that sustains tumor growth, offering a dual therapeutic advantage [106].After turning on PI3K, rapamycin and its analogs block mTOR signaling, which halts cell growth and metabolism [107]. However, drugs with high specificity and minimal off-target effects require further investigation. Future directions include exploring combination therapies with other drugs and identifying biomarkers to predict patient responses to PI3K inhibitors [106].Hypoxia pathway in MRHypoxia, a state of low oxygen availability, is a common feature of the tumor microenvironment and plays a crucial role in driving this MR through the activation of the hypoxia pathway [108]. The hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) pathway is the primary sensor for cellular oxygen levels. Under normoxic conditions, HIF alpha subunits undergo hydroxylation, degradation, and remain inactive. But when there isn't enough oxygen, HIF stays stable and moves to the nucleus, where it binds to hypoxia-response elements (HRE) on target genes. HIF activation in response to hypoxia triggers a cascade of metabolic changes that benefit cancer cells [109,110].On the one hand, HIF promotes glycolysis and allows for faster adenosine triphosphate (ATP) generation even with limited oxygen. HIF promotes the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), a key regulator of blood vessel formation. This helps tumors develop new blood vessels to improve their oxygen supply [111]. On the other hand, HIF regulates genes involved in glucose uptake, lactate production, and metabolic fuel sources like glutamine metabolism, allowing cancer cells to survive and proliferate in hypoxic environments [112]. This knowledge will inform the development of more effective therapeutic strategies that target both the hypoxic response and the metabolic adaptations of cancer cells.Adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathway in MRThe AMP -activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathway acts as a cellular energy sensor, playing a critical role in regulating metabolism and maintaining energy homeostasis. When it comes to MR, AMPK often works against pathways that promote growth. It encourages molecules to break down for energy and stops processes that build up resources when cells are under stress [113,114]. Various cellular stresses, such as low ATP and increased adenosine diphosphate (ADP) levels, as well as the influx of calcium ions into the cell, activate AMPK through specific signaling cascades. While AMPK generally acts as a tumor suppressor, its role in cancer is complex and context-dependent [115]. AMPK activation can limit the ability of cancer cells to take up excessive glucose and synthesize macromolecules for rapid growth. It inhibits lipogenesis and protein synthesis, then restricts the resources available for tumor progression. Under prolonged nutrient deprivation, AMPK activation can trigger cell death pathways in cancer cells [116]. Drugs that activate AMPK could potentially limit the metabolic rewiring of cancer cells and restrict their growth, while combining AMPK activators with other therapies targeting cancer metabolism might be a more effective strategy [117].Ras/Mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway (MAPK) in MRThe Ras/MAPK pathway, also known as the MAPK pathway, plays a crucial role in the process of MR. This pathway transmits signals from cell surface receptors to the nucleus, ultimately influencing gene expression and cellular behaviors like proliferation, differentiation, and survival. When dysregulated, the Ras/MAPK pathway can contribute to MR in cancer cells [104,118]. Various stimuli, including growth factors and oncogenic mutations, activate the Ras/MAPK pathway. These stimuli activate Ras guanosine triphosphate GTPases (hydrolase enzymes that bind to the nucleotide guanosine triphosphate (GTP) and hydrolyze it to guanosine diphosphate (GDP), which then activate a cascade of kinases [118]. Activated Ras proteins start the chain reaction by attaching to and turning on proteins known as rapidly accelerated fibrosarcoma kinases. These kinases then phosphorylate and turn on mitogen-activated protein kinase kinases (MEK). The phosphorylated MEKs then activate extracellular signal-regulated kinase proteins (ERK) which in turn translocate to the nucleus and phosphorylate various target genes, influencing cellular processes like proliferation, differentiation, and survival [104].The Ras/MAPK pathway is activated, triggering several metabolic changes that benefit cancer cells. Ras/MAPK signaling can stimulate glucose transporters on the cell surface, leading to increased glucose import and fueling aerobic glycolysis even in oxygen-rich environments [119], while extracellular signal-regulated kinase activation promotes the translation of mRNAs into proteins, necessary for rapid cell growth and proliferation [96]. The Ras/MAPK pathway can turn on the myelocytomatosis oncogene (Myc), which speeds up the processes of glycolysis, glutamine metabolism, and nucleotide synthesis to help cells grow quickly [120].Despite the promise, targeting the Ras/MAPK pathway has challenges. The complex interactions of the Ras/MAPK pathway necessitate the development of more specific inhibitors to minimize side effects [104]. In addition, cancer cells can develop resistance to single-agent therapies. Combination therapies targeting different nodes within the MR network might be more effective. Moreover, directly targeting mutant Ras proteins remains a significant challenge due to their complex biochemical properties [121]. To address these issues and create more potent therapeutic strategies that target the Ras/MAPK pathway in various cancer contexts, more research is required.Epigenetic regulation and MREpigenetic regulation and MR are increasingly recognized as interdependent processes that drive cellular adaptation in both physiological and pathological contexts, including cancer, neurodegeneration, and immune responses. Epigenetic regulation—mechanisms that influence gene expression without altering the deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) sequence itself—plays a crucial role in orchestrating MR [122]. Several epigenetic modifications can influence metabolic gene expression, as discussed at this point. First of all, the methylation of DNA CpG islands can silence gene expression of enzymes involved in oxidative phosphorylation and further promote a shift towards glycolysis [63]. Next, histone protein alterations such as acetylation and methylation can alter chromatin accessibility, influencing gene transcription, while specific histone modifications can promote or repress the expression of metabolism-related genes [123]. MicroRNAs (miRNAs), another type of non-coding RNA, can control gene expression by targeting messenger RNA (mRNA) for degradation or translation inhibition. miRNAs can also change the expression of metabolic enzymes and transporters [124].Epigenetic modifications can contribute to MR in several ways. Genes that encode enzymes involved in oxidative phosphorylation can be hypermethylated. This promotes a shift towards aerobic glycolysis, even in oxygen-rich environments [125]. Equally, the hypomethylation of genes encoding enzymes involved in glycolysis or glutamine metabolism can enhance their expression, favoring rapid cell growth [30]. Changes in epigenetics can affect the expression of proteins that help cells sense nutrients, like AMPK signaling. This could have an effect on how cells respond to the availability of nutrients [126]. Understanding the epigenetic regulation of MR has the potential to lead to novel therapeutic strategies. DNA methyltransferase inhibitors halt the enzymes responsible for methylating DNA, thereby activating normally inactive genes involved in oxidative phosphorylation. This may prevent cancer cell growth [127]. Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors can boost gene expression by encouraging histone acetylation. This could reactivate genes that are critical for normal cell metabolism. Reports suggest that, [128] miRNA-based therapies are promising strategies. Manipulating specific miRNAs that regulate metabolic enzymes could be a strategy to disrupt the reprogrammed state [129].Metabolic regulation and MRThe concept of "metabolic regulation and MR" sits at the heart of understanding cellular function and dysfunction in various biological contexts. Metabolic regulation ensures efficient use of resources under normal conditions. However, when a cell encounters a challenge, it can reprogram its metabolism to prioritize survival and function [72]. Cells tightly control the intricate network of biochemical reactions known as metabolism. This control ensures the efficient use of nutrients for energy production, biosynthesis, and other cellular processes. Metabolic regulation occurs at multiple levels, such as gene expression, which is the transcription factor that activates or represses genes encoding metabolic enzymes [130]. Substrate availability is the number of certain molecules that are present or absent and can change metabolic pathways. Another way to control pathways is through enzyme activity, where post-translational processes like phosphorylation can alter enzymes and their activity [131,132].MR is not a random shift but rather a strategic adaptation to altered environmental conditions or cellular demands. Various factors, such as nutrient availability in cancer cells, can drive this shift towards aerobic glycolysis to meet their biosynthetic needs, even in oxygen-rich environments [133]. Cellular signaling is the activation of specific signaling pathways that trigger metabolic changes to support cell growth, differentiation, or other functions [31]. The processes of metabolic regulation and reprogramming are not separate but rather intricately intertwined. Tight regulation allows cells to function normally, while reprogramming enables adaptation to changing needs. Briefly, understanding this interplay is crucial in various fields of biology and medicine. For example, targeting MR pathways holds promise for developing novel cancer therapies [72,96].Intercellular communication and MRThe interplay between intercellular communication and MR is a rapidly evolving field with significant implications for understanding multicellular organisms in health and disease [134]. Cells within a multicellular organism don't operate in isolation. They rely on complex communication pathways to coordinate activities, maintain homeostasis, and respond to environmental signals. This communication can occur through various mechanisms, as discussed below. During direct cell-to-cell contact, cells communicate via surface molecules that trigger signaling cascades within the recipient cell [134,135]. Cells secrete various hormones, cytokines, and growth factors that bind to receptors on target cells, altering their behavior through signaling molecules [134]. Furthermore, extracellular vesicles are small membrane-bound structures that transport molecules like proteins, lipids, and RNA between cells, influencing their metabolism and function [136]. Intercellular communication plays a crucial role in directing and coordinating MR across tissues and organs.Communication molecules activate signaling pathways that can directly influence metabolic enzymes and gene expression, leading to metabolic shifts. For example, insulin signaling promotes glucose uptake and lipogenesis in adipose tissues. Metabolic products, such as lactate from hypoxic cells, can function as signaling molecules, transmitting signals to nearby blood vessels to stimulate angiogenesis and increase oxygen delivery [57]. Intercellular communications can establish metabolic gradients within tissues, with different cell types specializing in specific metabolic functions to support the overall needs of the organism [137]. Understanding how intercellular communication shapes MR is crucial in various biological contexts. On the one hand, precise communication is vital for coordinated changes in cellular metabolism during embryogenesis and organogenesis. It also allows tissues to maintain a balanced metabolic profile and respond to changes in nutrient availability or stress [138].On the other hand, disruptions in intercellular communication pathways can contribute to metabolic disorders like diabetes and cancer [139]. Research in this field is ongoing, focusing on decoding the complex language of intercellular communication and its impact on MR. This knowledge holds promise for developing novel therapeutic strategies targeting communication pathways to influence metabolism and treat a variety of diseases.ConclusionVarious factors influence the complex process of MR, and ongoing research is underway to fully understand it. AMPK, HIF-1α, and mTORC1 are some of the signaling pathways that control the expression of genes that are involved in metabolism. For example, AMPK controls the expression of genes that make enzymes for glycolysis, mitochondrial function, and fatty acid synthesis [140] Activation of oncogenic signaling pathways such as PI3K/AKT/mTOR can alter metabolism, facilitating cell growth and division [107]. DNA methylation and histone acetylation can alter gene expression, impacting metabolic programs [141]. Cells adapt their metabolism based on nutrient availability. For instance, limited glucose intake can trigger a switch to glutamine metabolism, while the availability of glucose, glutamine, and other nutrients triggers signaling cascades that reprogram metabolism to utilize these nutrients efficiently [96]. Overall, genetic alterations, signaling pathways, and the tumor microenvironment interact to mediate the dynamic process of MR. These reprogramming’s, as key examples, fuel cancer cell growth, survival, and other cancer hallmarks [25].Preventive mechanisms for MRPreventive mechanisms for MR involve the regulation of key signaling pathways, mitochondrial function, and nutrient availability to maintain metabolic homeostasis and counteract pathological shifts in cellular metabolism [25].Modulating signaling pathwaysSignaling pathways play a key role in regulating the metabolic switch, making them promising targets for preventing reprogramming. Molecular changes are made by key pathways like adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1). mTORC1 promotes cell growth and proliferation, often favoring aerobic glycolysis [142]. Conversely, AMPK acts as a cellular energy sensor, promoting oxidative phosphorylation during low-energy states [143]. Strategies to activate AMPK or inhibit mTORC1 could potentially drive cells towards a more oxidative metabolic state. A sirtuin protein 1 (SIRT1) is another potential target. SIRT1 activation promotes oxidative phosphorylation and mitochondrial biogenesis while suppressing glycolysis [144,145]. Researchers are investigating drugs that activate AMPK or inhibit mTORC1 for their potential to prevent reprogramming in diseases like cancer [116]. However, researchers are exploring natural compounds like resveratrol, which activates SIRT1, for their potential therapeutic benefits [146].Despite the promise, significant challenges remain. First of all, the molecules that specifically target desired pathways while avoiding unintended effects on cellular function are crucial. Metabolic alteration patterns differ between diseases, and tailoring therapeutic approaches to specific diseases is necessary. Next, targeting multiple signaling pathways concurrently might be more effective than single-agent therapies. Modulating signaling pathways holds significant promise for preventing MR in various diseases. While challenges exist, ongoing research in developing specific modulators and combination therapies paves the way for future therapeutic strategies.Targeting metabolic enzymesMR, a hallmark of various diseases, disrupts cellular metabolism and fuels disease progression. It involves a shift away from oxidative phosphorylation towards aerobic glycolysis, even in oxygen-rich environments [18]. Targeting key metabolic enzymes involved in this shift offers a promising strategy to prevent reprogramming. Enzymes like phosphofructokinase/fructose-2,6-biphosphatase isozyme 3 (PFKFB3) play a crucial role in glycolysis. Stopping or starting enzymes in the oxidative phosphorylation pathway might make mitochondria work better and make more ATP, which might stop reprogramming [147]. However, off-target effects and the potential for compensatory mechanisms need careful consideration while delivering activators specifically to mitochondria, which remains a challenge [14].Nutritional interventionsNutritional interventions offer a promising, non-invasive strategy to prevent shifts and promote metabolic flexibility. Restricting readily available glucose through dietary changes, such as low-carbohydrate diets, can force cells to use alternative fuels like fatty acids, potentially suppressing aerobic glycolysis [148]. Conversely, high-fat, low-carbohydrate ketogenic diets promote the production of ketone bodies, an alternative fuel source for the brain and other tissues. This can potentially alleviate reliance on glucose-derived energy and prevent reprogramming [149]. Certain vitamins and minerals, like B vitamins, play a role in metabolic processes. Ensuring an adequate intake of these micronutrients could support a healthy metabolism and prevent reprogramming [150]. Similarly, supplements containing antioxidants such as vitamin E may help reduce oxidative stress, which contributes to the progression of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) [151], while dietary fiber intake promotes gut health and improves insulin sensitivity, potentially preventing reprogramming [152].However, nutritional needs vary based on age, health status, and genetics. Developing personalized dietary approaches for optimal metabolic health is crucial [153]. In addition, long-term adherence to specific dietary protocols can be challenging. Developing sustainable dietary strategies is crucial for prevention. We need further research to understand the specific mechanisms by which different dietary interventions, such as fiber, polyphenols, and healthy fats, influence reprogramming in various disease contexts [154]. In the future, we need to develop tools for personalized dietary recommendations based on individual metabolic profiles and explore the combination of nutritional interventions with other preventive strategies, such as exercise, for improved efficacy.Impact of mitochondrial transporters (MTS) on MRMitochondrial transporters (MTs) play a pivotal role in metabolic reprogramming (MR) by regulating the flux of metabolites, ions, and cofactors across the MIM, thereby influencing key bioenergetic and biosynthetic pathways essential for cellular adaptation in health and disease. Solute mitochondrial carriers, encoded by the SLC25 gene family, play a crucial role in maintaining efficient metabolism in cells. The SLC25 family is diverse, with 53 members exhibiting distinct substrate specificities and tissue expression patterns. The mitochondria link them to various metabolic pathways, such as oxidative phosphorylation, energy metabolism, fatty acid oxidation, and heat production [4].Mutations or dysregulation of these transporters can disrupt the balance of mitochondrial metabolism, leading to pathological conditions. Recent reports suggest that alterations in the expression and activity of these transporters have a significant impact on MR [15]. Further research on these transporters could shed new light on human diseases and their relationship to metabolic switches, allowing for the development of novel therapeutic strategies [55]. Several mitochondrial transporter genes still lack clarity about their transport metabolites, while others share similar transport elements with some minor specificity differences, such as kinetic features, selectivity, and specificity [155]. This review concentrated on the majority of genes that studies have fully identified, highlighting their implications for medical interest and preferences for those with distinct metabolites to shuttle. A summary table (Table5) is attached to this review; details on diseases mainly involved in mutations or alterations in the expression and the type of metabolic reprogramming are provided.Mitochondrial carrier proteins: a mechanistic overviewMitochondrial transporters (MTs) play a pivotal role in cellular homeostasis by enabling the exchange of metabolites, nucleotides, and ions across the MIM. Among these, the SLC25 family constitutes the largest group, with over 50 members in humans, each specialized for distinct substrates [7]. These transporters are essential for key metabolic pathways, including the TCA cycle, oxidative phosphorylation, amino acid metabolism, and fatty acid oxidation.Structural features of the SLC25 family, substrate recognition, and specificitySLC25 transporters share a conserved structural architecture consisting of six transmembrane α-helices arranged in a three-fold pseudo-symmetrical pattern [4]. This arrangement creates a central substrate-binding cavity that alternates exposure between the mitochondrial matrix and intermembrane space. Each SLC25 member typically consists of three homologous repeats, each contributing two transmembrane helices and signature motifs (Px[D/E]xx[K/R]) critical for substrate binding and gating mechanisms. Substrate recognition in SLC25 carriers is primarily governed by electrostatic and hydrogen-bonding interactions between specific amino acid residues in the translocation pathway and the transported molecule. For example, the mitochondrial ADP/ATP carrier (AAC, SLC25A4/5/6) uses conserved residues in the central cavity to distinguish between ADP and ATP [156,157]. Similarly, SLC25A1 recognizes and transports citrate/isocitrate by coordinating the substrate via charged residues and polar side chains [158].Conformational changes and transport mechanismSLC25 transporters operate via a "rocker-switch" or "alternating-access" mechanism. This mechanism involves conformational transitions between a cytoplasmic-open state (c-state) and a matrix-open state (m-state). Binding of the substrate from one side triggers a structural rearrangement, allowing its release on the opposite side, followed by transporter reset [159]. These transitions are driven by coordinated movements of transmembrane helices and controlled by salt-bridge networks and hydrophobic gates that prevent proton leakage during transport [160].Specific SLC25 family transport cycles and other mitochondrial transportersEach SLC25 transporter has evolved a unique transport cycle to match its substrate. The ADP/ATP carrier mediates an electroneutral antiport of ADP and ATP, tightly coupled to cellular respiration demands [161]. The mitochondrial pyruvate carrier, which consists of the MPC1 and MPC2 complex, employs a distinct mechanism that involves heterodimer formation and proton-coupled transport [158]. The phosphate carrier (SLC25A3) functions via H⁺-symport, exploiting the proton gradient across the inner membrane to co-transport phosphate into the matrix [162]. Other mitochondrial transporters such as VDAC (Voltage-Dependent Anion Channel) on the outer membrane and MCU (Mitochondrial Calcium Uniporter) play integral roles in metabolite flux and ion homeostasis. VDAC facilitates passive diffusion of ATP, ADP, and metabolites, while MCU allows controlled calcium uptake, critical for mitochondrial signaling and bioenergetics. Unlike SLC25 family members, these transporters operate via pore-like or channel-like mechanisms, contributing to rapid ion flux rather than selective substrate exchange [163,164].Therapeutic implications and structural insightsUnderstanding the structure–function relationship of SLC25 transporters has enabled structure-guided drug design, particularly for disorders involving metabolic dysregulation, such as cancer, neurodegeneration, and cardiovascular disease. Small molecules that affect how SLC25 works—such as bongkrekic acid (which blocks AAC) or SLC25A1 inhibitors like CTPI-2—have shown promise in early research models [165]. Advances in cryo-EM and X-ray crystallography have further refined our understanding of these mechanisms, laying the groundwork for precision-targeted therapies [166].Overview of mitochondrial transporters (MTs) on MRImpact on MR of mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC)The mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC) is critical in cellular metabolism because it facilitates the entry of pyruvate into mitochondria, where it serves as a critical substrate for the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and aerobic energy production [167]. Recent research has highlighted the significance of MPC in MR, a process by which cells adapt their metabolism in response to changes in their environment or pathological conditions [25]. One of the key findings in studies on MPC is its impact on the balance between glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation. Dysregulation of MPC function or expression can shift cellular energy production from oxidative phosphorylation to glycolysis, a phenomenon often associated with cancer cell metabolism known as the Warburg effect [167]. Furthermore, researchers have investigated MPC's role in metabolic diseases such as diabetes and obesity. Alterations in MPC activity can affect glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity, highlighting its role in the regulation of systemic energy homeostasis [168].In addition to its impact on metabolic diseases and cancer, research into MPC has also shed light on its role in cardiovascular health. Dysfunctional MPC activity can contribute to cardiac metabolic remodeling, affecting heart function and the progression of heart diseases [169]. Researchers have investigated the potential therapeutic implications of targeting MPC in MR. By restoring normal metabolic pathways, changing MPC activity could be a promising way to treat diseases like cancer and metabolic disorders that are marked by metabolic dysregulation [170]. In conclusion, the mitochondrial pyruvate carrier is crucial for MR, influencing cellular energy production, disease progression, and therapeutic outcomes across a range of physiological and pathological contexts. Ongoing research into MPC provides valuable insights into its role in cellular metabolism and its potential for therapeutic intervention [171].Impact on MR of citrate carrier (CIC), SLC25A1The mitochondrial citrate carrier (CIC), encoded by the SLC25A1 gene, is a protein embedded in the inner mitochondrial membrane that plays a critical role in cellular metabolism. Its primary function is to transport citrate, a key intermediate molecule, out of the mitochondrial matrix [172]. Citrate serves as a substrate for the Tricarboxylic Acid (TCA) cycle, also known as the Krebs cycle, within the mitochondria. The TCA cycle is the core pathway for generating energy through oxidative phosphorylation. CIC ensures a steady supply of citrate for the TCA cycle, promoting efficient energy production [173,174]. Beyond the TCA cycle, the CIC exports citrate for a variety of cytosolic processes. These include fatty acid synthesis, a critical aspect of cell growth and survival, particularly in cancer cells [175]. A recent study has shed light on the significant impact of CIC on MR, the process by which cells adjust their metabolic pathways to meet their specific needs.Studies using mice with reduced CIC levels demonstrate its importance in heart development. This transporter loss resulted in impaired growth, cardiac malformations, and disrupted mitochondrial function. This suggests that SLC25A1 has a dose-dependent effect on MR during heart formation, with proper citrate transport being critical for the transition from glycolysis to mitochondrial OXPHOS [176]. Interestingly, research has linked mutations in CIC to pediatric congenital heart disease in humans, suggesting a potential role in disease development [9,177]. Furthermore, CIC appears to play a key role in promoting tumor growth and survival in cancers like colorectal cancer. Studies have demonstrated that inhibiting CIC significantly impedes cancer cell growth by suppressing cell cycle progression and inducing cell death [178]. In addition, CIC seems to reprogram cancer cell metabolism. Under normal conditions, it promotes fatty acid synthesis, which fuels cancer cell growth. During metabolic stress, it enhances oxidative phosphorylation, potentially protecting cancer cells from stress-induced death [178]. Researchers are currently exploring inhibition of SLC25A1 function as a potential therapeutic strategy in cancer treatment [179].Studies exploring CIC inhibition (SLC25A1) as a cancer treatment strategy have shown promise. Inhibiting CIC disrupts citrate transport, leading to the accumulation of the oncometabolite D-2-hydroxyglutarate (D-2HG). This accumulation can sensitize cancer cells to radiation therapy by affecting DNA damage repair and cellular function [180]. In conclusion, CIC emerges as a critical regulator of MR. Its role in transporting citrate has an impact on both mitochondrial energy production and cytoplasmic biosynthetic pathways. Further research is required to fully understand the mechanisms by which CIC influences these processes, as well as its potential as a therapeutic target in diseases like cancer and congenital heart defects.Impact on MR of ornithine carrier 2 (ORC2), SLC25A2The SLC25A2 gene encodes Ornithine carrier 2, an emerging area of research in the context of disease and MR. Recent research suggests that ORC2, the ornithine carrier protein, may contribute to disease development by influencing cellular metabolism, although the exact implications are still under investigation. ORC2 facilitates the transport of ornithine, an amino acid precursor for polyamines, which are in turn essential for cell growth and proliferation [181]. Recent studies have implicated ORC2 activity in the dysregulation of polyamine metabolism in cancer cells, potentially contributing to tumor growth and progression [182]. Additional reports associate ORC2 function with metabolic alterations in diseased states [183]. Moreover, overexpression of the mitochondrial transporter ORC2 has been observed in certain cancers, where it may promote tumor cell proliferation and survival via enhanced polyamine metabolic activity [184].Moreover, ORC2 dysfunction might also be implicated in other diseases like nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), Alzheimer's, and Parkinson's disease, although the mechanisms are under investigation [185]. Similarly, studies suggest that ORC2 might be involved in regulating glutamate metabolism in the brain. Neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's implicate imbalances in glutamate, a key neurotransmitter [186,187]. Understanding ORC2's role in glutamate metabolism could provide insights into new therapeutic targets, while gene activity regulation may be a target for cancer therapies [188]. As research progresses, we will likely gain a clearer picture of how ORC2 might influence MR in various cell types and disease states.Impact on MR of phosphate carrier (PiC), SLC25A3The phosphate carrier, known as solute carrier 25A3 (SLC25A3), actively transports inorganic phosphate across the inner mitochondrial membrane, ensuring efficient ATP production and potentially influencing calcium handling within the mitochondria. Studies suggest that PiC deficiency can impact cellular metabolism or reach other physiologic circumstances, but not necessarily through direct reprogramming [189].For example, a 2012 study found that microRNA (MiR-141) is a potential regulator of the phosphate carrier, which is essential for ATP production. Overexpression in diabetic hearts causes a decrease in PiC protein content and ATP synthase activity, similar to the diabetic phenotype. Diabetes-induced miRNA changes may influence mitochondrial proteomes and functional processes, such as ATP production [190]. Kwong et al. revealed that PiC, encoded by SLC25A3, played a role in regulating the opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (MPTP). PiC attenuated cardiac ischemic-reperfusion injury and provided partial protection against Ca2+overload in cells by modulating MPTP opening [191]. A study investigating antigen-specific T cells found that mitochondrial dysfunction induced by the deletion of PiC (the SLC25A3 gene) substantially impacted T cell function [192].Loss of SLC25A3 function disrupts mitochondrial phosphate import, leading to decreased ATP production [189]. Cells may then switch to alternative metabolic pathways, like aerobic glycolysis, to compensate for the energy deficit. We can view this as a cellular reaction to preserve energy equilibrium rather than an inherent reprogramming by PiC [18]. There may be indirect effects or interactions between MR and PiC that have not been extensively explored. In summary, research in this area is ongoing, and future discoveries will reveal more about the role of PiC in metabolism. Further investigations are needed to shed light on this topic and provide a deeper understanding of the relationship between MR and PiC.Impact on MR of adenine nucleotide translocase 1 (ANT1), SLC25A4The SLC25A4 gene encodes translocase, which exchanges ATP from the mitochondria, an energy producer, and ADP from the cytoplasm, an energy user, to maintain cellular energy homeostasis [193]. However, current research focuses more on its role in maintaining cellular energy balance than directly influencing MR. The gene ensures a constant supply of ATP in the cytoplasm, which fuels various cellular processes. Disruptions in ANT1function can lead to metabolic imbalances [194]. While ANT1 might not directly cause MR, its role in energy homeostasis could indirectly influence how cells adapt their metabolism under stress conditions. For example, cancer cells often reprogram their metabolism for survival and proliferation [18]. ANT1 dysfunction could potentially affect their ability to maintain the high energy demands of this reprogrammed state [195]. We need to conduct more research on ANT1 dysfunction and its effects on cellular bioenergetics, as this could provide insights into its relationship to MR.Impact on MR of adenine nucleotide translocase 2 (ANT2), SLC25A5Adenine nucleotide translocase 2 (ANT2), encoded by the SLC25A5 gene, is a key MIM protein responsible for exchanging ADP and ATP across the MIM. Unlike its isoforms ANT1 and ANT3, which are predominantly expressed in differentiated tissues and favor oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), ANT2 is preferentially expressed in proliferating and undifferentiated cells. In disease contexts such as cancer, ANT2 is frequently overexpressed, where it contributes to a metabolic shift away from mitochondrial respiration toward glycolysis [196]. This adaptation allows cells to sustain ATP production under hypoxic or nutrient-limited conditions common in the tumor microenvironment and helps maintain mitochondrial membrane potential even when respiration is impaired.Beyond oncology, dysregulated ANT2 expression has also been implicated in cardiovascular and metabolic diseases. For instance, SLC25A5 overexpression in failing hearts has been associated with altered energy substrate preference, leading to impaired ATP delivery and bioenergetic failure in cardiomyocytes [197]. Similarly, in models of metabolic syndrome and obesity, increased ANT2 activity has been linked to mitochondrial uncoupling, elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and insulin resistance. These effects reflect ANT2's unique role in sustaining glycolysis and modulating mitochondrial function under pathophysiological stress [198].Mechanistically, ANT2 can suppress apoptosis by preventing mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) opening, thereby contributing to cell survival in pathologies where programmed cell death would normally be protective [199]. In hepatocellular carcinoma and colorectal cancer models, knockdown of SLC25A5 restores mitochondrial respiration, decreases glycolytic flux, and sensitizes cells to chemotherapeutic agents [197]. These findings highlight how important ANT2 is for changing metabolism and helping diseases progress by stopping cell death and allowing flexible energy use.Taken together, the emerging role of ANT2 in disease-associated MR positions it as both a biomarker and a therapeutic target. Strategies aimed at inhibiting ANT2 expression or disrupting its ADP/ATP exchange function are being explored to reverse the glycolytic phenotype and restore mitochondrial integrity in both cancer and metabolic diseases [200].Impact on MR of adenine nucleotide translocase 3 (ANT3), SLC25A6Adenine nucleotide translocase 3 (ANT3), encoded by the SLC25A6 gene, is one of the four isoforms of the ANT family, which mediates the exchange of ADP and ATP across the MIM. In both normal and pathological states, SLC25A6 plays a crucial role in regulating mitochondrial metabolism, especially during metabolic stress and cellular transformation [201].In cancer, dysregulation of ANT3 has been implicated in MR by modulating mitochondrial respiration and ATP production. Unlike ANT2, which supports glycolysis and cell proliferation, ANT3 is more associated with promoting apoptosis and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). Overexpression of SLC25A6 in several tumor types, including hepatocellular carcinoma and colorectal cancer, has been linked to increased mitochondrial permeability and caspase-dependent cell death, suggesting a tumor-suppressive role through maintenance of mitochondrial integrity [202,203]. Conversely, silencing ANT3 reduces mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis and promotes a metabolic switch toward glycolysis, facilitating cancer cell survival in hypoxic conditions.Beyond oncology, ANT3 plays a significant role in cardiovascular and neurodegenerative disorders where metabolic flexibility is critical. In cardiac ischemia–reperfusion injury, ANT3 dysfunction has been associated with impaired mitochondrial ADP/ATP exchange, leading to energy deficiency and increased oxidative stress in cardiomyocytes [204,205]. In models of Alzheimer's disease, ANT3 expression is altered in response to amyloid-beta-induced mitochondrial damage, suggesting a role in neuronal energy metabolism and cell fate [206]. Additionally, ANT3 has been shown to interact with the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP), and its dysregulation may lower the threshold for pore opening, triggering apoptosis under oxidative stress conditions [207].Interestingly, SLC25A6 has also emerged as a key regulator in immune metabolism. In activated T-cells and macrophages, changes in ANT3 expression influence metabolic switching between glycolysis and OXPHOS, affecting immune cell differentiation and function [208]. Therapeutically, modulating ANT3 expression or its ADP/ATP transport activity presents a promising strategy to enhance apoptosis in cancer cells or protect against mitochondrial dysfunction in metabolic and degenerative diseases. Researchers are exploring small molecules, such as bongkrekic acid analogs, that stabilize ANT3 conformation and prevent pore opening for their cytoprotective effects in preclinical models [209].Impact on MR of adenine nucleotide translocase 4 (ANT4), SLC25A31Adenine nucleotide translocase 4 (ANT4), encoded by SLC25A31, is a member of the mitochondrial solute carrier family that mediates the exchange of ATP and ADP across the MIM. SLC25A31 is aberrantly expressed in various cancers and may play an adaptive role in tumor cell metabolism, particularly under stress conditions such as hypoxia or DNA damage [210,211].The unique role of ANT4 in MR is evident in its resistance to mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP)-mediated apoptosis. Unlike ANT1 and ANT3, which promote mPTP opening and apoptosis under stress, ANT4 is associated with resistance to cell death and enhanced mitochondrial integrity during rapid cell proliferation [212]. This anti-apoptotic property may support cancer cell survival by stabilizing mitochondrial function while sustaining high ATP turnover through glycolysis and mitochondrial respiration. In fact, SLC25A31 upregulation has been observed in hepatocellular carcinoma and testicular germ cell tumors, correlating with poor prognosis and resistance to chemotherapeutics [213].Functionally, ANT4 supports metabolic flexibility by enabling mitochondrial ATP export under conditions where other ANT isoforms are compromised. In mouse models, SLC25A31-deficient male mice are sterile due to arrested spermatogenesis and impaired mitochondrial ATP dynamics, indicating a non-redundant role for ANT4 in energy-demanding developmental stages [214]. This dependency on ANT4 is thought to extend to highly proliferative cancer cells that co-opt germline programs—a phenomenon termed “oncofetal reprogramming.” The preferential expression of ANT4 in tumors also makes it a potential immunotherapeutic target, with recent studies suggesting that its restricted normal expression may allow for tumor-selective targeting [215].Moreover, SLC25A31 has been implicated in the metabolic remodeling associated with chemoresistance. Other studies demonstrated that ANT4 upregulation in cisplatin-resistant cancer cells enhanced ATP efflux and preserved mitochondrial potential, helping cells avoid apoptosis. Targeting ANT4 pharmacologically or through siRNA restored sensitivity to cisplatin and reduced tumor growth in xenograft models [212,216]. These findings point out the value of ANT4 in regulating mitochondrial bioenergetics, apoptosis resistance, and MR during disease progression.Impact on MR of uncoupling proteins (UCP5 and 4), SLC25A14, 27Uncoupling Protein 5 (UCP5), also known as SLC25A14, is an intriguing target in the context of MR. UCP5, a mitochondrial protein, produces heat by dissipating the proton gradient required for ATP production [217]. This uncoupling process reduces the proton gradient, leading to less ATP generation, potentially forcing cells to seek alternative energy sources [218]. Furthermore, UCP5-mediated heat generation can play a role in regulating body temperature. Brown adipose tissue (BAT), a specialty in heat production, exhibits high expression of the gene. Increased UCP5 activity in BAT is associated with enhanced calorie burning and improved metabolic health [219].Generally, the role of UCP5 in other tissues is less clear. Some studies suggest UCP5 might be involved in MR in diseases like obesity and type 2 diabetes, but the mechanisms are under investigation [220]. Still, these results show that targeting UCP5 could be useful in developing new medicines that aim to change energy metabolism in diseases that involve MR [221]. The exploration of uncoupling proteins (UCPs), particularly UCP4, has unveiled its critical involvement in the reprogramming of cellular metabolism. The brain predominantly expresses UCP4, which regulates mitochondrial membrane potential and prevents the production of ROS [217].Studies that looked at UCP4 found that it helps protect neurons from metabolic stress by separating oxidative phosphorylation. This lowers the production of ROS and makes cells more resistant to oxidative damage. This mechanism is particularly relevant in neurodegenerative diseases, where oxidative stress plays a pivotal role in disease progression [219]. Conversely, the Warburg effect, a MR associated with cancer cells, has implicated UCP4. The activity of UCP4 in cancer cells seems to help with the switch to aerobic glycolysis. This helps cells multiply and grow quickly by making the best energy production pathway for their higher energy needs [18].Researchers have highlighted UCP4's role in modulating insulin sensitivity in the context of diabetes. Studies suggest that UCP4 may influence glucose utilization and energy expenditure efficiency, thereby regulating blood glucose levels and insulin sensitivity [217]. Researchers have also investigated the impact of UCP4 on mitochondrial biogenesis and dynamics, suggesting that it may be involved in mitochondrial quality control, influencing both the removal of damaged mitochondria and the formation of new mitochondria [222]. In conclusion, the implications of UCP4 on MR are significant, encompassing various physiological and pathological processes. The study findings underscore the potential therapeutic value of targeting UCP4 in diseases characterized by metabolic dysregulation, including neurodegenerative diseases, cancer, and metabolic disorders [221]. As research progresses, we will likely gain a clearer understanding of how SLC25A27 influences MR and its potential implications for human health and disease treatment.Impact on MR of dicarboxylate carrier (DIC), SLC25A10SLC25A10 encodes the Dicarboxylate Carrier (DIC) a mitochondrial transporter protein essential for MR. DIC facilitates the exchange of metabolites like pyruvate and malate, influencing the fuel sources cells utilize for energy production [223]. The exchange is vital for supplying the mitochondria, the cell's powerhouses, with substrates for energy production through the Krebs cycle. Depending on the metabolic needs of the cell, DIC activity can influence the preference for using glucose, fatty acids, or other substrates for energy production [224]. Furthermore, studies have implicated DIC in regulating redox homeostasis. The transport of dicarboxylates is crucial for maintaining the NAD+/NADH ratio within mitochondria, influencing not only energy production but also the cellular response to oxidative stress. This function of DIC emphasizes its role in protecting cells from oxidative damage as well as its potential impact on disease processes such as cancer and neurodegeneration [223,225]. Researchers have explored the role of DIC in cancer metabolism, specifically its contribution to the Warburg effect, which leads cancer cells to preferentially rely on glycolysis for energy production. Studies suggest that modulating DIC activity could affect cancer cell metabolism, offering a novel approach to targeting cancer cell growth and survival [223].Altered SLC25A10 expression and activity have been observed, while increased DIC activity has been implicated in promoting the Warburg effect in some cancers [223,226]. Additionally, alterations in SLC25A10 expression or function have been associated with metabolic disorders, including diabetes and obesity [227,228]. DIC dysregulation may disrupt metabolic homeostasis, contributing to the development and progression of these conditions. Researchers are also investigating DIC dysfunction in relation to other diseases such as heart failure and diabetes, where altered cellular metabolism plays a significant role [229]. To sum up, SLC25A10, a dicarboxylate carrier, is an important part of MR because it affects energy production, redox homeostasis, and how cells adapt to changes in their environment [223]. These findings highlight the importance of DIC in maintaining metabolic flexibility and suggest potential therapeutic targets for metabolic diseases and cancer. However, further research is required to clarify this area and enhance our understanding of the connection between MR and DIC.Impact on MR of aspartate-glutamate carrier 1 (AGC1), SLC25A12Recent research has highlighted the critical role of Aspartate-Glutamate Carrier 1 (AGC1), encoded by the SLC25A12 gene, in MR. AGC1 is a key component of the malate-aspartate shuttle, which is essential for transferring reducing equivalents from the cytosol into the mitochondria, thereby facilitating aerobic energy production [230,231]. One significant finding from studies on AGC1 is its contribution to cellular energy metabolism, particularly in the context of high-energy demanding tissues such as the brain and muscles. The carrier enables the efficient production of ATP via oxidative phosphorylation, supporting cellular function and viability [230]. Moreover, dysregulation of AGC1 in mice, has been implicated in various neurological disorders, including autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and epilepsy [231]. This association suggests that alterations in aspartate and glutamate transport can impact neuronal energy metabolism and neurotransmitter balance, highlighting the importance of AGC1 in brain function and development [230,232].Researchers have investigated AGC1's role in MR in cancer metabolism because it may influence the Warburg effect, which occurs when cancer cells preferentially use glycolysis over oxidative phosphorylation [233]. Modulating AGC1 activity could alter the metabolic strategies of cancer cells, potentially offering new avenues for therapeutic intervention [234]. Additionally, the study of AGC1 has extended to metabolic diseases such as diabetes, where alterations in mitochondrial metabolism play a significant role. AGC1 may affect glucose utilization and insulin sensitivity, underscoring its potential impact on systemic metabolic regulation [230].To sum up, Aspartate-Glutamate Carrier 1 (AGC1), plays a role in MR in a number of healthy and unhealthy conditions. These findings underscore the importance of AGC1 in energy metabolism, neural function, and disease pathogenesis. Despite controversy in the field, the ongoing research into AGC1 offers valuable insights into its therapeutic potential for metabolic and neurological disorders [235]. However, further research is required to shed light on this topic and gain a deeper knowledge of the relationship between MR and AGC1.Impact on MR of glutamate carrier 1 (GC1), SLC25A22Glutamate Carrier 1 (GC1), encoded by the SLC25A22 gene, is a mitochondrial solute carrier that transports glutamate into mitochondria for metabolism [236]. It plays a crucial role in cell MR, particularly in the context of energy metabolism and amino acid metabolism [237]. Various neurological conditions, including epilepsy and neurodevelopmental disorders, have implicated the dysfunction or deficiency of GC1 [238,239]. This is due to its critical role in glutamate metabolism, a key neurotransmitter in the brain [239]. While regulating glutamate levels within mitochondria, SLC25A22 contributes to the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, affecting ATP production [236]. As part of amino acid metabolism, GC1's activity influences the balance and availability of glutamate, which is not only a neurotransmitter but also a precursor for other amino acids and compounds. Moreover, given glutamate's role as a neurotransmitter, GC1's function is crucial for maintaining normal neurological function. Dysregulation can lead to excitotoxicity or neurotransmitter imbalances [240].When it comes to the context of cancer, studies highlight its crucial role in fueling cancer cell growth and survival [237]. SLC25A22 serves as a key substrate for energy production and biosynthetic processes—pathways frequently upregulated in cancer cells [236,237]. Increased expressions of GC1 in mice are associated with higher glutamate uptake, promoting the metabolic shift towards glutaminolysis, a process that converts glutamine to fuel cancer cell growth [241]. Consequently, targeting GC1 has emerged as a potential therapeutic strategy in cancer treatment. Inhibiting GC1 activity could starve cancer cells by limiting their glutamate supply and hindering glutaminolysis. Several GC1 inhibitors are currently under development or undergoing clinical trials [242].Impact on MR of glutamate carrier 2 (GC2), SLC25A18Glutamate Carrier 2 (GC2), encoded by the SLC25A18 gene, is a mitochondrial transporter responsible for importing glutamate into the mitochondrial matrix in a proton-dependent manner. It plays a central role in nitrogen and energy metabolism, as glutamate is a key substrate for both the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and ammonia detoxification through glutaminolysis. Even though SLC25A18 is mostly found in the central nervous system, recent research has indicated that it also plays a role in various diseases by affecting how mitochondria work and their metabolism [243,244].In the context of cancer, MR driven by glutamine dependence has been increasingly recognized. SLC25A18 contributes to this phenomenon by enabling mitochondrial glutamate uptake, which is subsequently converted to α-ketoglutarate (α-KG) and fed into the TCA cycle to support anabolic growth [30]. Although SLC25A18 has been more extensively studied alongside its isoform SLC25A22 (GC1), emerging data suggest that it may also be overexpressed in gliomas and neuroblastomas, which supports glutaminolysis-driven proliferation under hypoxic or nutrient-stressed conditions [244]. In such settings, GC2 function supports cancer cell survival by maintaining mitochondrial bioenergetics and redox balance through NADH/FADH₂ production and glutathione synthesis [245].In neurological diseases, particularly epileptic encephalopathy, SLC25A18 mutations have been linked to metabolic imbalances. For instance, homozygous loss-of-function mutations in SLC25A18 have been associated with developmental delay, hypotonia, and seizures, likely due to impaired mitochondrial glutamate handling, energy deficits, and excitotoxic damage in neurons [246]. These findings underscore the transporter's essential role in maintaining mitochondrial function and neurotransmitter cycling, especially in high-energy-demand tissues like the brain.Furthermore, GC2 may influence immune cell metabolism. Although direct studies are limited, the transporter's role in glutamate homeostasis suggests potential involvement in T cell activation and macrophage polarization, both of which rely on glutamine metabolism and mitochondrial glutamate flux [247]. This opens avenues for investigating SLC25A18 as a potential target in immunometabolic diseases. In summary, SLC25A18 (GC2) contributes to disease-relevant MR by regulating mitochondrial glutamate import, with implications for cancer metabolism, neuronal energy homeostasis, and possibly immune cell function. Further research is needed to elucidate its exact regulatory networks and therapeutic potential in metabolic disorders and malignancies.Impact on MR of thiamine pyrophosphate carrier (TPC), SLC25A19The SLC25A19 gene encodes the Thiamine Pyrophosphate Carrier (TPC), which plays a crucial role in MR by transporting thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP) across mitochondrial membranes. TPP, the active form of vitamin B1 (thiamine), serves as a cofactor for several enzymes crucial for carbohydrate metabolism [248]. Research into SLC25A19 has revealed its significance in facilitating mitochondrial bioenergetics and metabolic flexibility. TPC assists important metabolic pathways, such as the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and the pentose phosphate pathway, by allowing TPP to enter mitochondria. These pathways are critical for energy production as well as the generation of reducing equivalents and biosynthetic precursors [249].Metabolic disorders and mitochondrial diseases have been associated with alterations in TPC function or expression. Dysfunctional TPC can lead to thiamine deficiency within mitochondria, impairing energy metabolism and contributing to the development of conditions such as Amish microcephaly and neuropathy [9]. In the context of cancer, the role of TPC in MR has attracted attention for its potential to support the Warburg effect. The altered expression of TPC in tumor cells could modulate the availability of TPP, affecting the activity of TPP-dependent enzymes and thereby influencing glycolytic flux and anabolic growth [250]. Moreover, the study of TPC has implications for neurological health, given the importance of thiamine in brain metabolism. TPC mutations or dysregulation could affect neuronal function and survival, suggesting a potential link to neurodegenerative diseases and cognitive disorders [9,249].In summary, the implications of the Thiamine Pyrophosphate Carrier, SLC25A19, in MR are profound, affecting energy production, metabolic disorders, cancer metabolism, and neurological health. The ongoing investigation into SLC25A19 underscores its importance in mitochondrial function and highlights its potential as a therapeutic target across a range of diseases [250]. However, specific experimental research needs to be performed to gain more insights into the effects and mechanisms by which the gene is involved in MR and various diseases.Impact on MR of carnitine-acylcarnitine carrier (CAC), SLC25A20The Carnitine-Acylcarnitine Carrier (CAC), whose gene symbol is SLC25A20, is an important part of MR because it helps move acylcarnitines into the mitochondria for β-oxidation and extra acyl groups out of the mitochondria [251]. CAC is essential for the mitochondrial oxidation of long-chain fatty acids. By transporting acylcarnitines into the mitochondrial matrix and exchanging them with free carnitine, it enables the β-oxidation process, which is crucial for energy production, especially during periods of fasting or exercise [252]. Through its role in fatty acid oxidation, CAC significantly impacts the cellular energy balance, facilitates the breakdown of fatty acids, and helps to generate ATP, which is vital for various cellular processes and overall energy metabolism [253].Moreover, CAC contributes to metabolic flexibility, which is an organism's ability to adapt fuel oxidation to fuel availability. This is crucial for maintaining energy homeostasis under different nutritional states, such as fasting or a high-fat diet [251]. Recent studies reported that dysregulation or mutations in the SLC25A20 gene can lead to Carnitine Acylcarnitine Translocase (CACT) deficiency, a rare metabolic disorder that affects the body's ability to derive energy from fats [254]. This emphasizes the role of CAC in metabolic health and disease. Understanding the function and regulation of CAC could lead to therapeutic strategies for metabolic diseases. Modulating CAC activity might help manage conditions characterized by impaired fatty acid oxidation, such as obesity, diabetes, and certain cardiomyopathies [255].In summary, the Carnitine-Acylcarnitine Carrier plays a pivotal role in MR by facilitating fatty acid oxidation in the mitochondria, impacting energy metabolism and metabolic flexibility, and potentially offering targets for therapeutic intervention in metabolic disorders [9,255]. While CAC presents a promising target, the specific implications of its role in MR and its effectiveness as a therapeutic target require further investigation.Impact on MR of oxoadipate carrier (ODC), SLC25A21The specific implications of the oxoadipate carrier (ODC), encoded by the SLC25A21 gene, on MR are still emerging, but some studies suggest its potential role in regulating cellular metabolism [256]. ODC is responsible for transporting oxoacids, such as 2-oxoadipate, into the mitochondria [257]. The oxoacids can be precursors for ketone body production and serve as an alternative energy source, particularly during periods of restricted glucose availability [258]. Studies suggest that certain cancers may exhibit elevated expression of SLC25A21. The increased reliance of cancer cells on alternative fuel sources, such as ketone bodies, to sustain their growth could be the reason for this [256].Also, ODC activity might affect the metabolism of the whole cell by controlling the amount of oxoacid substrate that is available in the mitochondria. Further research is necessary to understand the specific implications of this impact on various metabolic pathways [259]. Research on SLC25A21 and its role in MR is ongoing. To fully understand its specific implications and potential connections to diseases like cancer, further studies are necessary.Impact on MR of ATP-Mg/Pi carrier 1 (APC1), SLC25A24ATP-Mg/Pi Carrier 1 (APC1), encoded by the SLC25A24 gene, is a mitochondrial inner membrane transporter that mediates the exchange of adenine nucleotides complexed with magnesium (ATP-Mg) and inorganic phosphate (Pi). It plays a critical role in regulating mitochondrial adenine nucleotide pools, influencing both ATP availability and phosphate homeostasis within the mitochondrial matrix. APC1 is part of the ATP-Mg/Pi carrier (APC) family, which includes other isoforms such as SLC25A23 and SLC25A25 [260]. These carriers are essential for coupling mitochondrial energy metabolism with cellular demands, particularly under stress conditions. Dysregulation or mutation of SLC25A24 has been increasingly implicated in disease-associated MR, particularly in neurodevelopmental and cardiovascular disorders [260,261].In neurological diseases, pathogenic variants in SLC25A24 have been linked to Fontaine progeroid syndrome, a rare and severe developmental disorder characterized by craniofacial abnormalities, connective tissue dysplasia, and profound growth retardation. These mutations—most notably de novo missense mutations like p. Arg217His—have been shown to increase the carrier's affinity for ATP-Mg and alter the mitochondrial membrane potential, resulting in mitochondrial hyperpolarization, increased ROS generation, and apoptotic susceptibility [262,263]. This study suggests that SLC25A24-associated dysfunction leads to metabolic stress, which contributes to early-onset tissue degeneration and impaired cellular energy management. The clinical severity of Fontaine progeroid syndrome underscores the crucial role of APC1 in maintaining mitochondrial energetic equilibrium in highly metabolic tissues such as the brain [264].Furthermore, evidence suggests that APC1 activity is closely associated with cellular stress responses and metabolic adaptation. Under high-energy demands, SLC25A24 is activated by calcium binding through its EF-hand motifs, facilitating increased exchange of ATP-Mg and Pi to buffer matrix ATP levels. This ensures sufficient ATP availability for mitochondrial enzymes, particularly those involved in oxidative phosphorylation and stress defense [260]. However, under pathological conditions such as ischemia or oxidative stress, aberrant SLC25A24 function can impair ATP flux, exacerbate metabolic inefficiency, and promote apoptotic cascades—mechanisms relevant in stroke and neurodegeneration [263].In cardiovascular disease, altered expression of SLC25A24 has been observed in models of cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure, where it may act as a stress-response modulator. Mitochondrial ATP-Mg/Pi exchange is critical in cardiomyocytes due to their high reliance on oxidative phosphorylation. Dysregulation of APC1 may contribute to impaired ATP delivery during pressure overload or ischemic insult, increasing vulnerability to energy deficits and contractile dysfunction [263].Finally, while less well characterized in cancer, there is emerging evidence suggesting that APC1 may contribute to MR in proliferating cells. Elevated SLC25A24 expression has been observed in several tumor types, including prostate and breast cancers, correlating with increased mitochondrial activity and resistance to metabolic stress. Although its mechanistic role in cancer metabolism remains under investigation, its link to calcium-mediated mitochondrial regulation suggests a possible role in maintaining bioenergetic flexibility during rapid tumor cell proliferation [265].In summary, SLC25A24 (APC1) is a vital mitochondrial carrier involved in adenine nucleotide and phosphate transport, important for preserving mitochondrial bioenergetics. Its dysfunction is increasingly recognized in the metabolic pathophysiology of neurodevelopmental, cardiovascular, and possibly oncologic diseases.Impact on MR of ATP-Mg/Pi carrier 2 (APC2), SLC25A23The SLC25A23 gene encodes APC2, an isoform of the ATP-Mg/Pi carrier belonging to the mitochondrial solute carrier family. This carrier facilitates the transport of adenine nucleotides and divalent cations, particularly ATP in complex with Mg2⁺, along with inorganic phosphate (Pi), across the mitochondrial inner membrane. While its critical function in regulating mitochondrial ATP availability is well established, its direct involvement in MR remains largely unexplored [266]. As an ATP-Mg/Pi exchanger, SLC25A23 directly influences mitochondrial energy output and cellular bioenergetics through the exchange of ATP and ADP, impacting both mitochondrial respiration and cytosolic ATP supply [225]. Magnesium ions (Mg2⁺) may influence intracellular signaling pathways, as Mg2⁺ serves as an essential cofactor in numerous enzymatic processes [267].Although direct effects on MR require specific evidence, SLC25A23's role in energy metabolism and mitochondrial function suggests it could influence how cells adapt their metabolism in response to various conditions, such as stress, disease, or cancer [268,269]. Emerging research is investigating potential links between APC2 dysfunction and various diseases, but the connection to MR remains unclear [269]. SLC25A23 facilitates the exchange of cytosolic ATP-Mg2⁺ for mitochondrial Pi or vice versa, depending on the cellular energy demands. This exchange plays a crucial role in maintaining mitochondrial nucleotide balance and regulating bioenergetic homeostasis. Dysregulation or mutation of SLC25A23 could impair this balance, potentially leading to defective ATP handling within mitochondria and altered cellular energy metabolism [268]. In cancer cells, such impairment may force metabolic adaptation toward glycolysis or other compensatory pathways, thereby contributing to metabolic reprogramming (MR). Moreover, the unique calcium-binding EF-hand motifs of SLC25A23 link mitochondrial energy metabolism with intracellular calcium signaling, a relationship increasingly recognized as important in stress responses and tumor progression [270,271]. In summary, while the precise role of SLC25A23 in MR remains under active investigation, current evidence suggests it may influence key bioenergetic and signaling networks relevant to disease states, including cancer.Impact on MR of ATP-Mg/Pi carrier 3 (APC3), SLC25A25ATP-Mg/Pi Carrier 3 (APC3), encoded by the SLC25A25 gene, is a member of the mitochondrial carrier family involved in the transport of ATP complexed with magnesium (ATP-Mg) in exchange for inorganic phosphate (Pi) across the mitochondrial inner membrane. This transport is essential for regulating intramitochondrial nucleotide pools, maintaining bioenergetic homeostasis, and enabling rapid ATP delivery during periods of fluctuating energy demand. APC3 is uniquely responsive to cytosolic calcium via EF-hand domains, which modulate its activity and link mitochondrial energetics to calcium signaling, particularly in metabolically dynamic tissues such as skeletal muscle, brain, and heart [260,272].Recent research has highlighted the role of SLC25A25 in metabolic adaptation during stress and disease, with implications for both neurological and inflammatory conditions. In the brain, where neuronal survival relies on tightly regulated mitochondrial energy production, APC3 activity is essential for calcium-stimulated ATP supply. A deficiency in APC3 has been shown to impair synaptic function by reducing mitochondrial ATP availability in neurons during excitatory stimulation, making it a candidate contributor to neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease and epilepsy [273]. In mice, knockout of SLC25A25 leads to reduced ATP buffering capacity and altered response to metabolic stress in neurons and myocytes, suggesting that the carrier is critical for energy reprogramming in stress-prone tissues [273].In inflammatory and immune diseases, APC3 plays an emerging role in regulating immunometabolism. Another study demonstrated that SLC25A25 is induced by pro-inflammatory stimuli such as LPS in macrophages, where it modulates mitochondrial respiration and ATP transport in a calcium-dependent manner [274]. This regulation affects macrophage activation and cytokine secretion, positioning APC3 as a potential link between mitochondrial bioenergetics and innate immune responses. Given the increasing recognition of metabolic reprogramming in immune cells—particularly the shift between glycolytic and oxidative phenotypes—SLC25A25 may represent a novel target in disorders characterized by chronic inflammation or metabolic dysregulation, such as sepsis, rheumatoid arthritis, and metabolic syndrome [273].Further, in the context of metabolic disease, expression of SLC25A25 is dynamically regulated by nutritional states. For instance, APC3 expression increases during caloric restriction or fasting, indicating its involvement in mitochondrial energy reallocation during nutrient stress [160]. This suggests that SLC25A25 is integral to adaptive energy metabolism, potentially contributing to the beneficial effects of caloric restriction on metabolic and cardiovascular health.Though direct evidence in cancer is limited, the role of APC3 in ATP regulation, redox homeostasis, and calcium handling suggests it may also influence tumor cell metabolism under hypoxic or nutrient-deprived conditions, particularly where mitochondrial flexibility confers survival advantages. Given its sensitivity to calcium and metabolic state, SLC25A25 might contribute to the metabolic plasticity observed in malignancies, warranting further exploration in cancer models.In summary, SLC25A25 (APC3) is a calcium-regulated ATP-Mg/Pi transporter that plays critical roles in mitochondrial energy dynamics and metabolic reprogramming during stress. Its dysregulation has been implicated in neurodegenerative diseases, immune activation, and metabolic adaptation, highlighting it as a candidate for targeted intervention in pathologies characterized by mitochondrial dysfunction and altered bioenergetics.Impact on MR of s-adenosylmethionine carrier (SAMC), SLC25A26The SLC25A26 gene encodes the S-Adenosylmethionine Carrier (SAMC), which serves as a transporter for S-adenosylmethionine, a crucial methyl donor molecule involved in various cellular processes, including methylation reactions for DNA, RNA, and proteins. The availability of SAM within the mitochondria has an impact on these methylation processes [275]. Alterations in SAM transport can disrupt mitochondrial function, leading to metabolic imbalances that contribute to diseases such as liver dysfunction, obesity, and insulin resistance [276,277]. Furthermore, research into SAMC has provided insights into its role in aging and neurodegeneration. Maintaining SAM levels in mitochondria is an important part of keeping them healthy. It affects processes like oxidative stress response, mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) repair, and apoptosis, all of which play a major role in age-related diseases and neurodegenerative conditions [9,278].Research indicates that certain cancers exhibit overexpression of SLC25A26. Researchers may link overexpression to a metabolic shift that cancer cells undergo to support their rapid growth. The hypothesis is that increased SAM import into the mitochondria due to higher SAMC activity could influence this shift [279]. Another study suggests that SLC25A26 overexpression in cancer cells leads to increased mitochondrial SAM levels, which in turn can cause hypermethylation of mtDNA [279,280]. The mtDNA hypermethylation might disrupt mitochondrial function and potentially contribute to the altered metabolism observed in cancer cells. Further research is necessary to fully understand the cause-and-effect relationship, but these findings suggest a potential link between SAMC, SAM transport, and MR in cancer. In summary, research in this area is ongoing, and the investigation into SLC25A26 highlights its potential as a therapeutic target for addressing metabolic disorders, cancer, and age-related diseases [281].Impact on MR of pyrimidine nucleotide carrier 1 (PNC1), SLC25A33The Pyrimidine Nucleotide Carrier 1 (PNC1), encoded by SLC25A33, has emerged as a significant player in the regulation of cellular metabolism, particularly in the context of MR. PNC1 facilitates the transport of pyrimidine nucleotides into mitochondria, which is crucial for DNA synthesis and repair and for the regulation of mitochondrial gene expression [266]. A pivotal discovery regarding PNC1 involves its role in cell proliferation and differentiation. SLC25A33 changes the availability of pyrimidine nucleotides in mitochondria, which has an effect on how mitochondria work and how energy is used. These processes are necessary for rapidly dividing cells to grow and stay healthy [282]. Moreover, various metabolic and mitochondrial disorders have linked to alterations in the expression or function of PNC1. Such dysregulation can lead to impaired mitochondrial DNA synthesis and function, contributing to the pathogenesis of diseases characterized by mitochondrial dysfunction, including neurodegenerative diseases and myopathies [283,284].Researchers in cancer research have investigated the potential of SLC25A33 in MR to support tumor cells' metabolic demands. It is important for cancer cells that are multiplying to be able to transport pyrimidine nucleotides efficiently so that they can make nucleic acids. This means that PNC1 could be a target for therapies that aim to mess up tumor metabolism [285]. Additionally, studies have highlighted the importance of SLC25A33 in the immune system's function. The way PNC1 controls the amount of pyrimidine nucleotides in mitochondria may affect the growth and activation of immune cells, giving us information about how immune responses are controlled metabolically [266,282]. To summarize, PNC1 is an important part of MR because it controls the levels of pyrimidine nucleotides in mitochondria, which affect cell growth, differentiation, and disease development. Ongoing research into SLC25A33 offers promising insights into its therapeutic potential for metabolic disorders, cancer, and immune regulation [225].Impact on MR of pyrimidine nucleotide carrier 2 (PNC2), SLC25A36Pyrimidine Nucleotide Carrier 2 (PNC2), encoded by the SLC25A36 gene, is a mitochondrial inner membrane transporter that mediates the import of pyrimidine nucleotides—namely cytidine monophosphate (CMP), uridine monophosphate (UMP), and thymidine monophosphate (TMP)—into the mitochondrial matrix in exchange for inorganic phosphate or other nucleotides. This transport is essential for mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) replication and RNA transcription, linking SLC25A36 directly to mitochondrial biogenesis and energy production via oxidative phosphorylation [282].Disruption in SLC25A36 function has emerged as a key factor in metabolic dysregulation, particularly within disorders that rely on nucleotide homeostasis and mtDNA integrity. Recent studies have shown that mutations in SLC25A36 can lead to mtDNA depletion syndromes, with clinical manifestations including hypotonia, developmental delay, and failure to thrive, especially in early infancy. These phenotypes are consistent with a bioenergetic crisis stemming from impaired mtDNA replication due to the lack of imported pyrimidine nucleotides, which are required for mitochondrial genome maintenance [286].Moreover, SLC25A36 has been implicated in broader metabolic reprogramming in disease states. For example, in certain cancers where rapid proliferation demands high nucleotide turnover, SLC25A36 expression is upregulated to ensure sufficient pyrimidine nucleotide supply within mitochondria, supporting mtDNA replication and mitochondrial function under increased biosynthetic demand. In this context, targeting SLC25A36 could impair mitochondrial biogenesis and reduce oxidative phosphorylation capacity, potentially sensitizing tumor cells to metabolic stress or therapeutic agents [282].Additionally, a study by Xin et al. (2019) demonstrated that loss-of-function mutations in SLC25A36 impair not only mitochondrial nucleotide metabolism but also global mitochondrial dynamics, leading to fragmented mitochondrial networks and elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation [287]. These mitochondrial defects may contribute to altered redox homeostasis and inflammatory signaling, further exacerbating metabolic reprogramming in disease states such as autoimmune syndromes and neurodegenerative conditions.Given its essential role in mitochondrial nucleotide import and genome maintenance, SLC25A36 is a promising target for further investigation in metabolic disorders characterized by mitochondrial dysfunction. Understanding its regulatory mechanisms and tissue-specific expression profiles may reveal new opportunities for therapeutic interventions in diseases involving aberrant metabolic remodeling.Impact on MR of glycine carrier (GlyC), SLC25A38SLC25A38 encodes the Glycine Carrier (GlyC), which plays a crucial role in cellular metabolism, especially during MR. GlyC is instrumental in transporting glycine into mitochondria, where it is a key substrate for heme synthesis and other essential biochemical pathways [266]. Research into SLC25A38 has highlighted its pivotal function in erythropoiesis and the synthesis of heme, an essential component of hemoglobin. Sideroblastic anemia, characterized by insufficient heme production and iron overload in mitochondria, is associated with GlyC dysregulation. This shows how important glycine transport is for red blood cell development [288].Furthermore, studies have investigated the role of SLC25A38 in MR in cancer cells. Given the high demand for rapid cell proliferation, cancer cells exhibit altered metabolic pathways, including increased heme synthesis. GlyC's role in facilitating glycine transport into mitochondria may therefore contribute to tumor cells' metabolic flexibility, supporting their growth and survival under various conditions [289]. Apart from its influence on heme synthesis and erythropoiesis, studies have linked GlyC to the regulation of mitochondrial function and energy metabolism. Glycine is involved in multiple metabolic pathways, including the synthesis of glutathione, a major antioxidant. Therefore, GlyC's activity can influence cellular oxidative stress responses and overall metabolic health [290].Moreover, the study of SLC25A38 offers potential therapeutic insights, particularly for diseases characterized by metabolic dysregulation, such as metabolic disorders and certain forms of anemia. By targeting GlyC's function or expression, novel treatment strategies may be developed to correct metabolic imbalances and improve patient outcomes [291]. In summary, GlyC plays a crucial role in MR, impacting erythropoiesis, heme synthesis, and mitochondrial function. The ongoing research into GlyC emphasizes its importance in cellular metabolism and its potential as a therapeutic target for a variety of diseases [292,293].Impact on MR of coenzyme A carrier (CoA carrier), SLC25A42The SLC25A42 gene codes for the Coenzyme A Carrier (CoA Carrier), which helps move Coenzyme A (CoA) into mitochondria. CoA is an important cofactor in many biochemical reactions, including the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, fatty acid synthesis, and oxidation [294]. Researchers have discovered that SLC25A42 is a key component of keeping metabolism flexible, allowing cells to change how they make energy based on what their bodies require. SLC25A42 influences key metabolic processes by regulating CoA mitochondrial availability and supporting cellular energy homeostasis [76]. Furthermore, alterations in CoA carrier expression or function have been linked to metabolic disorders. Dysregulation of CoA transport can impact mitochondrial metabolism, leading to imbalances that contribute to conditions such as diabetes, obesity, and mitochondrial myopathies [295,296]. Researchers have explored SLC25A42's role in MR in cancer to support the altered metabolic demands of tumor cells. The efficient transport of CoA into mitochondria is essential for the enhanced biosynthetic and energy production pathways characteristic of rapidly proliferating cells, suggesting that targeting the CoA carrier could disrupt tumor metabolism [76].Additionally, studies have investigated the impact of the CoA carrier on aging and longevity. Given its role in regulating mitochondrial function and oxidative stress, the CoA carrier may influence longevity and the onset of age-related diseases, offering potential targets for interventions aiming to promote healthy aging [297,298]. In conclusion, the CoA carrier is a key part of MR. It controls the amount of CoA in mitochondria, which has an impact on many physiological processes and disease states. Ongoing research into the CoA carrier offers valuable insights into its therapeutic potential for addressing metabolic disorders, cancer, and aging-related conditions [294]. However, the field of MR is constantly evolving, and further research is needed to fully understand how the CoA carrier impacts MR across different cell types and its potential implications for health and disease.Comprehensive conclusionThe emerging evidence so far developed highlights the significant impact of mitochondrial transporters (MTs), particularly members of the SLC25 family, on disease-associated metabolic reprogramming (MR). MTs directly regulate the intracellular redistribution of metabolic intermediates essential for supporting altered energy demands, redox status, and biosynthetic processes in disease states. Their dysregulation has emerged as a pivotal factor in driving pathological MR across various systems.In cancer, MTs such as SLC25A1 (citrate carrier), SLC25A10 (dicarboxylate carrier), and SLC25A11 (oxoglutarate carrier) are frequently upregulated, promoting tumor cell proliferation by supporting anabolic biosynthesis, redox homeostasis, and adaptation to nutrient stress. These transporters contribute to the rewiring of central carbon metabolism and reinforce the Warburg effect, which enhances glycolysis even in the presence of oxygen. Their inhibition has been shown to suppress tumor growth and sensitize cancer cells to chemotherapeutics, highlighting their relevance as therapeutic targets.In neurodegenerative and neurometabolic diseases, mutations in MTs such as SLC25A13 (AGC2), SLC25A22 (glutamate carrier), and SLC25A15 (ornithine carrier) disrupt amino acid shuttling and neurotransmitter balance, exacerbating neuronal vulnerability and mitochondrial dysfunction. These defects often result in disease-specific patterns of MR, such as altered glutamate flux, oxidative imbalance, and impaired ATP generation. Cardiovascular disease models demonstrate that altered expression or function of MTs like SLC25A4 (ANT1) and SLC25A3 (phosphate carrier) directly impacts myocardial energy metabolism and contributes to pathological remodeling. Similarly, changes in SLC25A5 (ANT2) expression influence the metabolic phenotype of ischemic and hypertrophic hearts, linking MTs to energetic failure and contractile dysfunction.Overall, MTs are integral to the control of MR in both inherited and acquired diseases. Their transporter-specific effects on metabolite flux and bioenergetic adaptation underscore their value as precise metabolic targets. The emerging disease-specific expression profiles and functional consequences of MT dysregulation support the development of targeted therapies aimed at restoring mitochondrial transport fidelity to counteract maladaptive MR (Table5).Impact of dysfunction of mitochondrial transporters (MTS) on diseasesDysfunction of mitochondrial transporters (MTs) has been increasingly linked to the development and progression of numerous human diseases. Mutations or defects in MTs disrupt mitochondrial homeostasis and impair metabolic signaling, often leading to pathological consequences [15,333]. These abnormalities frequently result in reduced ATP production due to impaired transport of metabolic substrates, contributing to cellular energy deficits that underlie various disease phenotypes [333,334].Accumulation of metabolic byproducts caused by defective export functions of MTs can elevate mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS), causing oxidative damage and mitochondrial stress [335]. In parallel, dysregulation of mitochondrial calcium handling due to transporter malfunction may trigger pro-apoptotic signaling and cell death, which is a recognized contributor to neurodegenerative and cardiac diseases [336].These pathological alterations in mitochondrial energy balance, redox state, and calcium homeostasis are increasingly recognized as central mechanisms in the pathogenesis of disorders such as cardiomyopathies, neurodegenerative diseases, metabolic syndromes, and inherited mitochondrial disorders [15,337]. Thus, MT dysfunction is not only a marker but also a driver of disease-related MR, highlighting its significance in disease progression and therapeutic targeting.Impact of dysfunction of MTs on neurodegenerative diseasesNeurodegenerative diseases (NDDs) pose a significant global health burden, characterized by the progressive loss of neurons and cognitive decline [338]. Increasing evidence suggests that mitochondrial dysfunction plays a central role in the development of these diseases. Specialized transporter proteins within mitochondria are crucial for maintaining proper mitochondrial function, and their dysregulation emerges as a critical factor contributing to the neurodegenerative process (Fig.1) [339].Fig. 1Overview on dysfunction of MTs and metabolic switch in neurodegenerative diseases. Note that pathophysiologic phenomena are more complex than depicted. Genetic mutations affecting mitochondrial solute carriers, such as SLC25A19 and SLC25A20, result in compromised substrate translocation, diminished adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthesis, and elevated levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Furthermore, specific transporters, including SLC25A10, SLC25A17, and SLC25A22, have been implicated in Alzheimer's disease (AD) predisposition; notably, SLC25A22 dysfunction induces glutamate excitotoxicity and hippocampal atrophy. Deficiencies in adenine nucleotide translocase (SLC25A4) activity and voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC) dysfunction disrupt mitochondrial energy metabolism and calcium homeostasis. Accumulation of amyloid-beta (Aβ) within mitochondria impairs glucose and pyruvate transport, calcium signaling, and mitochondrial dynamics, manifesting as an imbalance in fission and fusion processes, leading to mitochondrial fragmentation. AD is characterized by a reduction in cerebral glucose utilization, which correlates with diminished activity of tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle enzymes, including pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDHc) and α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex (KGDHc). Additional factors contributing to neuronal damage in AD encompass dysregulation of mitochondrial dynamics and aberrant mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) functionFull size imageRole of MTs in neuronal health and diseaseMutations or defects in MTs can disrupt the delicate balance within neurons, leading to a cascade of detrimental effects [340]. Mutations in the thiamine pyrophosphate carrier (SLC25A19) gene are linked to thiamine metabolism dysfunction syndrome 4, and changes in the carnitine-acylcarnitine carrier (SLC25A20) gene can cause mitochondrial phosphate carrier deficiency [251,341]. Impaired substrates import due to dysfunctional transporters can significantly decrease ATP production, leading to an energetic crisis and neuronal dysfunction [342]. Additionally, impaired export mechanisms can cause the accumulation of byproducts within mitochondria, leading to the generation of harmful ROS [77]. The reactive molecules, in turn, damage cellular components and contribute to neuronal death [343]. Dysfunctional calcium transporters can also disrupt neuronal signaling through excessive uptake or impaired release from mitochondria, triggering cell death pathways [344]. Various neurodegenerative diseases implicate the consequences of dysfunctional MTs. Amyloid-beta plaques, a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease, may accumulate due to impaired transport of glucose and pyruvate and disrupted calcium signaling resulting from transporter dysfunction [345]. Similarly, mutations in genes encoding MTs for specific substrates, linked to Parkinson's disease, contribute to the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra [346]. In Huntington's disease, the mutant huntingtin protein interacts with and potentially disrupts MTs, leading to energetic deficits and neuronal death [347].Various investigations have identified several additional members of the SLC25 family with direct involvement in neurodegenerative conditions. For example, mutations in the SLC25A12 gene, encoding the aspartate/glutamate carrier AGC1, have been associated with global cerebral hypomyelination and epilepsy. Affected individuals show severe developmental delays and neurological deficits due to impaired NADH shuttling and aspartate availability [348]. Likewise, mutations in SLC25A13 (AGC2), involved in the malate-aspartate shuttle, lead to neonatal intrahepatic cholestasis and citrin deficiency, often accompanied by neuropsychiatric manifestations, especially in adults [349].SLC25A15 encodes the mitochondrial ornithine transporter and is mutated in hyperornithinemia-hyperammonemia-homocitrullinuria (HHH) syndrome, a urea cycle disorder with cognitive impairment and cerebellar atrophy [350]. Dysfunction of the dicarboxylate carrier SLC25A10 has been associated with impaired redox homeostasis and susceptibility to neuroinflammation, potentially contributing to Alzheimer’s disease and multiple sclerosis pathologies [351].Moreover, pathogenic mutations in SLC25A22, which encodes a mitochondrial glutamate carrier, have been linked to early infantile epileptic encephalopathy (EIEE3), a devastating neurological disorder characterized by intractable seizures, cortical atrophy, and global developmental delay [238,306]. SLC25A46 mutations cause a spectrum of neurodegenerative disorders, including optic atrophy, Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 2, and Leigh syndrome, due to impaired mitochondrial dynamics and cristae morphology, reflecting its critical role in maintaining mitochondrial integrity in neurons [352].In conclusion, understanding the role of MTs in neurodegeneration provides new opportunities for therapeutic interventions. Identifying small molecules that can activate or inhibit specific transporters shows promise for improving mitochondrial function and protecting neurons [353]. For diseases caused by genetic mutations in transporter genes, gene therapy approaches could potentially restore normal transporter function and prevent neurodegeneration [354]. Mitochondrial transporter dysfunction emerges as a critical player in the development of neurodegenerative diseases, and ongoing research on these essential proteins holds promise for the development of novel therapeutic strategies to prevent or slow the progression of these devastating diseases [14,355].Key mechanism of mitochondrial transporters and metabolic switch in Alzheimer’s DiseaseAlzheimer's disease (AD) is a multifaceted neurodegenerative disorder with various underlying molecular mechanisms. Researchers have identified mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and metabolic alterations as key factors in AD pathogenesis. Mitochondrial transporters (MTs) play a critical role in maintaining cellular homeostasis, and their dysregulation can lead to neuronal damage in AD (Fig.1) [356,357].Dysregulation of mitochondrial transport and dynamics in AD pathophysiologyRecent investigations have implicated specific members of the SLC25 family of MTs in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease [179]. Genetic polymorphisms influencing the expression of the dicarboxylate carrier (SLC25A10), peroxisomal membrane protein PMP34 (SLC25A17), and glutamate carrier 1 (SLC25A22) have been associated with increased AD susceptibility [358]. While not directly localized to the mitochondrial membrane, the L-glutamate transporter GLT-1 (also known as EAAT2 and encoded by the SLC1A2 gene) plays a critical role in regulating extracellular glutamate concentrations in the central nervous system. Dysfunctional GLT-1 activity can lead to excessive glutamate accumulation in the synaptic cleft, resulting in excitotoxicity and secondary mitochondrial damage, which are key pathological features in Alzheimer's disease (AD) [359]. In contrast, downregulation of SLC25A22 has been correlated with hippocampal vulnerability and atrophy, key neuropathological features of AD, while the mutations in SLC25A22 are associated with epileptic encephalopathy [360].Furthermore, the adenine nucleotide translocase (SLC25A4), which mediates ADP/ATP exchange, exhibits reduced activity in AD, potentially leading to mitochondrial energy deficit [208]. The voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC), located in the mitochondrial outer membrane, facilitates ion and metabolite transport between the mitochondria and cytosol. VDAC dysfunction in AD can disrupt mitochondrial calcium signaling [206]. Additionally, mitochondrial accumulation of amyloid precursor protein and amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptides has been observed in AD and other neurodegenerative disorders [361,362]. Dysregulation of mitochondrial dynamics, specifically an imbalance favoring fission over fusion, has been implicated in AD pathogenesis, potentially involving fission/fusion proteins such as Mfn1 and Mfn2 [340]. Furthermore, AD pathogenesis involves dysregulation of mitochondrial fission/fusion dynamics and mitophagy, indicating synergistic dysfunction in these processes [15].Mitochondrial dysfunction and metabolic alterations in ADResearchers have linked the progression of AD to changes in mitochondrial quality control mechanisms, such as mitophagy. But, changes in the way the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) works have been connected to damage to neurons caused by Aβ in AD [363]. Studies have also shown that the loss of dynamin-like protein 1 (DLP1) leads to changes in the shape and distribution of mitochondria in Alzheimer's disease. This shows how important mitochondrial dynamics are in the disease [364]. We have identified metabolic dysfunction, particularly glucose metabolism and insulin resistance, as a significant aspect of AD pathophysiology [365]. Diminished glucose metabolism is a hallmark of many neurodegenerative diseases, including AD. Reduced glucose utilization occurs early in the disease process and is highly correlated with cognitive decline [49]. This drop might be because important enzymes in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle are working less well. These enzymes include the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDHc) and the α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex (KGDHc). These metabolic changes can lead to impaired mitochondrial function and energy deficits, contributing to neuronal dysfunction [49].Research has shown that AD is characterized by brain hypometabolism, detectable through positron emission tomography scans [366]. Moreover, disruptions in the brain's insulin pathways and glucose transporters have been associated with cognitive impairment in AD [367]. One of the parts of the secretome that mitochondrial dysfunction in AD affects is Apolipoprotein E (APOE), a well-known risk factor for AD. Mitochondrial dysfunction can influence the expression and secretion of APOE, underscoring the intricate relationship between mitochondrial function and AD pathogenesis [368].ConclusionMitochondrial dysfunction is central to Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis, with dysregulation of mitochondrial transporters (MTs) playing a key role. Mutations in transporters like SLC25A19 and SLC25A20 impair substrate transport, reduce ATP production, and increase reactive oxygen species (ROS). Specific transporters, including SLC25A10, SLC25A17, and SLC25A22, are linked to AD susceptibility, with SLC25A22 dysfunction causing glutamate excitotoxicity and hippocampal atrophy. Reduced activity of adenine nucleotide translocase (SLC25A4) and voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC) dysfunction disrupt energy metabolism and calcium signaling. Amyloid-beta (Aβ) accumulation in mitochondria impairs glucose and pyruvate transport, calcium signaling, and mitochondrial dynamics, such as fission/fusion imbalance. AD is characterized by brain hypometabolism, with reduced glucose utilization linked to impaired activity of TCA cycle enzymes like PDHc and KGDHc. Dysregulation of mitophagy, mitochondrial dynamics, and the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) further contributes to neuronal damage. Mitochondrial dysfunction also influences Apolipoprotein E (APOE) expression, highlighting its role in AD progression. Targeting mitochondrial function and transport mechanisms may offer therapeutic potential (Fig.1).Impact of dysfunction of MTs on cardiovascular diseasesMitochondria play a crucial role in producing adenosine triphosphate (ATP) through oxidative phosphorylation but also generate ROS [335]. Dysfunctional mitochondria compromise cellular respiration and energy production and act as hazardous ROS producers, leading to oxidative stress, apoptosis, and cell damage (Fig.2) [369]. We describe these processes as important components of the pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases such as atherosclerosis, ischemia/reperfusion injury, cardiac hypertrophy, and heart failure [369].Fig. 2Overview on mitochondrial transporters and metabolic switch in failing heart. Note that pathophysiologic phenomena are more complex than depicted. Impairments in specific mitochondrial transporters (MTs) such as adenine nucleotide translocase (ANT), mitochondrial phosphate carrier (PiC), and citrate carrier (CIC) lead to reduced ATP synthesis, resulting in energy deficits that contribute to heart failure. Dysregulation of the mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU) and sodium-calcium exchanger 1 (NCX1) is associated with cardiac issues like arrhythmias, hypertrophy, and heart failure. Additionally, decreased fatty acid oxidation (FAO) due to deficiencies in carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (CPT1) and the carnitine-acylcarnitine carrier (CAC) leads to increased lipid accumulation and mitochondrial dysfunction. MTs also play a role in maintaining redox balance; their dysfunction causes elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and oxidative stress. Overall, disruptions in mitochondrial transporter function significantly contribute to cardiomyocyte apoptosis, fibrosis, and necrosis, which are critical features of cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure progressionFull size imageRole of MTs in cardiac function and diseaseMTs play an important role in transporting molecules involved in energy production, such as metabolites and cofactors. Dysfunction disrupts this process, leading to an energy deficit in heart muscle cells known as cardiomyocytes [370]. Similarly, dysfunction of these transporters can lead to reduced ATP production while impairing the energy supply for cardiac muscle contraction and overall cardiovascular function. Specifically, mitochondrial transporter dysfunction, such as the ATP/ADP translocase known as adenine nucleotide translocases, can disrupt ATP synthesis and impair energy production in cardiac cells. This can lead to energy depletion, reduced contractile function, and overall cardiac dysfunction [371]. Similarly, MTs play an important role in the exchange of calcium ions between the cytosol and mitochondria. Dysfunctional mitochondrial calcium transporters can disrupt calcium homeostasis, leading to abnormal calcium signaling and mitochondrial dysfunction. Calcium dysregulation can contribute to cardiac hypertrophy, arrhythmias, and impaired contractility (Fig.2) [372].As aforementioned, mitochondria are a source of reactive oxygen species, but healthy mitochondria also possess antioxidant mechanisms. Dysfunctional transporters can disrupt this balance, leading to increased ROS production and oxidative stress. This oxidative stress damages cellular components like proteins and DNA, contributing to cardiomyocyte death and heart dysfunction [373]. On the other hand, mitochondrial carriers transport nucleotides and other molecules necessary for mitochondrial DNA replication and repair. Then, when these transporters don't work right, they can cause DNA damage and mutations in mitochondria, which can make mitochondrial function worse and lead to heart diseases [370].Also, MTs help make reducing equivalents like nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide + hydrogen (H) [27] and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH), which are very important for keeping the redox balance in cells [374]. Dysfunction of these transporters can disrupt redox homeostasis, leading to increased oxidative stress and altered cellular signaling, which can contribute to cardiovascular disease pathogenesis [370]. However, the specific impacts of mitochondrial transporter dysfunction can vary depending on the specific transporter involved and the cardiovascular disease context. Furthermore, mitochondrial transporter dysfunction frequently occurs in conjunction with other factors such as genetic predisposition, lifestyle factors, and co-existing metabolic conditions, all of which contribute to disease development [375]. Further research is required to fully understand the mechanisms by which mitochondrial transporter dysfunction contributes to the development of cardiovascular diseases and identify potential therapeutic targets for intervention.Key mechanism of MTs and metabolic switch in heart failure (HF)MTs and metabolic shifts in HFThe metabolic switch in heart failure (HF) relies heavily on mitochondrial membrane transporters. The transition from mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) to glycolysis as a primary energy source in heart failure involves intricate molecular mechanisms [376]. Studies have shown that microRNAs, such as the miR-199a∼214 cluster, target key regulators like peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-delta (PPARδ), contributing to the metabolic shift towards glycolysis in heart failure. Additionally, histone deacetylases (Hdac) class I activation has been linked to mitochondrial dysfunction in cardiomyocytes through the regulation of factors like tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), leading to impaired myocardial function and mitochondrial damage [377].Furthermore, alterations in mitochondrial Ca2+accumulation and ion transport in failing hearts have been linked to mitochondrial dysfunction, expanding our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying heart failure [378]. Calcium is essential for excitation–contraction coupling in cardiomyocytes and various cellular responses in cardiovascular cells [379]. Different causes of heart failure, such as coronary artery disease and hypertension, commonly induce dysregulation of calcium handling at the myocyte level [380]. Cardiac conditions, including heart failure, are associated with abnormal calcium regulation, influenced by changes in the expression levels or activities of calcium transporters such as the sodium-calcium exchanger 1 (NCX1) and sarco-endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase (SERCA2) [381].Oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction in HFThe development of heart failure implicates Carnitine Palmitoyltransferase 1 (CPT1), a crucial enzyme in fatty acid oxidation (FAO). Researchers have found that not having enough CPT1 makes mitochondrial problems, lipid buildup in the myocardium, and cardiomyocyte death worse, which speeds up the progression of heart failure (Fig.2) [382,383]. Also, oxidative stress is a significant factor in HF, and mitochondria are both a source and a target of reactive oxygen species. Increased oxidative stress can damage mitochondrial DNA, proteins, and lipids, leading to impaired mitochondrial function and a vicious cycle of further oxidative stress [384]. Antioxidant therapies targeting mitochondrial dysfunction have shown promise in preclinical studies [385]. Furthermore, adenosine monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a key regulator of energy homeostasis and metabolic flexibility in the heart. Activation of AMPK can enhance mitochondrial biogenesis and improve metabolic flexibility, which is often impaired in HF. Studies have shown that activating AMPK can stop HF from happening by improving the function of mitochondria and lowering the buildup of lipids [386].Role of MTs in energy homeostasis and heart failureResearchers have identified mitochondrial proteome remodeling and oxidative stress as key factors in pressure overload-induced heart failure, highlighting the role of mitochondrial proteins in the pathogenesis of heart failure [387]. For example, the mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU) is important for taking in calcium in mitochondria. If it doesn't work right, it can cause energy production to slow down and oxidative stress to rise, which can lead to HF [388]. Additionally, the mitochondrial phosphate carrier (SLC25A3) is essential for maintaining energy homeostasis in cardiomyocytes, and its dysfunction can exacerbate HF [389]. The adenine nucleotide translocase (SLC25A4) is an exchanger of ADP for ATP across the mitochondrial inner membrane. Impaired function of SLC25A4 can lead to reduced ATP synthesis and increased oxidative stress, contributing to HF. The opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) further links SLC25A4's dysfunction to mitochondrial permeability and cell death [202,390].Dysfunction of the mitochondrial citrate carrier (SLC25A1) has been associated with altered lipid metabolism and energy imbalance in heart failure (HF), contributing to reduced ATP availability and pathological lipid accumulation [391]. Similarly, impaired activity of the dicarboxylate carrier (SLC25A10) disrupts mitochondrial redox homeostasis and tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle flux, exacerbating mitochondrial dysfunction observed in HF models [266]. Defects in the oxoglutarate carrier (SLC25A11) have also been implicated in HF, where compromised 2-oxoglutarate transport contributes to impaired biosynthetic output and energy metabolism, further aggravating cardiac dysfunction [392]. Studies have also shown that the carnitine-acylcarnitine carrier (CAC) protein keeps the fatty acid oxidation process going. Losing this carrier protein has led to problems with FAO, which is the heart's main source of energy [393].ConclusionMitochondrial transporters are critical in cardiovascular diseases, regulating energy production, calcium homeostasis, and redox balance. Dysfunction of transporters like adenine nucleotide translocase (SLC25A4), mitochondrial phosphate carrier (SLC25A3), and citrate carrier (SLC25A1) disrupts ATP synthesis, leading to energy deficits and heart failure. Calcium transporters, including the mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU) and sodium-calcium exchanger 1 (NCX1), are essential for calcium homeostasis; their dysfunction causes arrhythmias, hypertrophy, and heart failure. Impaired fatty acid oxidation (FAO) exacerbates lipid accumulation and mitochondrial dysfunction due to deficiencies in Carnitine Palmitoyltransferase 1 (CPT1) and the carnitine-acylcarnitine carrier (CAC). MTs also regulate redox balance by managing NADH and NADPH; their dysfunction increases reactive oxygen species (ROS) and oxidative stress. In heart failure, a metabolic switch from oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) to glycolysis occurs, driven by factors like microRNAs (for example, the miR-199a∼214 cluster) and histone deacetylases (Hdac). AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activation can mitigate these effects by enhancing mitochondrial biogenesis and metabolic flexibility. These findings highlight mitochondrial transporter dysfunction, oxidative stress, and MR as central to cardiovascular disease pathogenesis (Fig.2).Impact of dysfunction of MTs on metabolic disordersThe MTs carefully manage the flow of molecules into and out of the mitochondria. They ensure that there is a steady flow of substrates for energy production as well as the export of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to keep cells running [394]. However, dysfunction of these vital transporters disrupts this delicate balance, leading to a cascade of events that can contribute to various metabolic disorders [8]. Mutations in genes encoding transporters responsible for importing substrates like pyruvate and fatty acids can cause mitochondrial dysfunction. Impaired pyruvate import due to dysfunctional pyruvate transporters limits the fuel available for the citric acid cycle, ultimately reducing ATP production [15]. Mutations in genes encoding MTs specifically cause various metabolic disorders, including Leigh syndrome, a severe neurological disorder that affects the nervous system [395]. Impaired pyruvate metabolisms in the mitochondria leads to the development of lactic acidosis, a buildup of lactic acid in the blood, while dysfunctional transporters for fatty acid import cause fatty acid oxidation disorders (Fig.3) [396].Fig. 3Overview on impaired mitochondrial transporter proteins and metabolism in T2D. Note that the pathophysiologic phenomenon is more complex than here depicted. Dysfunction in key mitochondrial transporters—such as the mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC), carnitine palmitoyltransferase (CPT) system, and citrate and dicarboxylate carriers—disrupts glucose and fatty acid metabolism, leading to ATP depletion, metabolite accumulation, oxidative stress, and inflammation. Additionally, impaired mitochondrial calcium handling and disruptions in the electron transport chain (ETC) exacerbate mitochondrial stress and insulin resistance. Regulatory pathways, including AMPK and SIRT1 signaling, also influence mitochondrial function and metabolic homeostasis. These molecular disturbances collectively contribute to the pathophysiology of T2DFull size imageAs previously mentioned, specific transporters must export the produced ATP from the mitochondria to the cytosol for cellular functions. Any disruption of the process can lead to ATP trapping within the mitochondria and reduce the available ATP in the cytosol, but it also hinders further ATP production due to a lack of adenosine diphosphate (ADP) import into the mitochondria, creating a vicious cycle [397]. Furthermore, dysfunction in transporters responsible for exporting ADP, a product of ATP hydrolysis, can hinder mitochondrial ATP regeneration. This disrupts cellular energy homeostasis and contributes to conditions like muscle weakness and fatigue [398]. Not being able to export citrate properly, which is an important part of the citric acid cycle, also breaks down the cycle and makes it less effective at making energy precursors [399]. Similarly, defects in carnitine transporters, which facilitate fatty acid entry into the mitochondria for breakdown, can lead to the accumulation of lipids in the cell, a hallmark of fatty liver disease [400]. Mitochondrial dysfunctions due to transporter issues can disrupt the electron transport chain, a key step in oxidative phosphorylation. This can cause more ROS, which are harmful byproducts of cellular respiration, to be made. ROS can damage proteins, lipids, and DNA within cells, which can mess up metabolic processes even more and make metabolic disorders more likely to happen (Fig.3) [401].Therefore, understanding the impact of dysfunctional MTs on metabolic disorders is crucial to developing targeted therapeutic interventions. Researchers are actively investigating the specific mechanisms through which MTs contribute to different metabolic disorders, such as obesity, diabetes, and neurodegenerative diseases. By elucidating these mechanisms, we can develop novel therapeutic strategies to modulate MTs and restore metabolic balance.Impact of dysfunction of MTs on obesityMitochondria, the powerhouses of our cells, play a crucial role in regulating energy metabolism and utilize substrates like fatty acids and glucose to generate ATP, the cell's main energy currency [402]. This process relies heavily on the proper function of MTs, specialized proteins embedded in the mitochondrial membrane. These transporters' dysfunction can disrupt cellular metabolism and contribute to obesity development [403].Firstly, dysfunction in the transporters that import substrates such as fatty acids and pyruvate into the mitochondria can restrict their utilization for energy production. This leads to increased reliance on carbohydrates for fuel and potentially promotes fat storage [404]. Specifically, carnitine transporters are essential for transporting fatty acids into the mitochondria for breakdown. Defects in these transporters can impede fatty acid oxidation, a primary mechanism for fat utilization, as well as lead to fat accumulation and weight gain [405]. Next, impaired uptake of substrates translates to reduced ATP production within the mitochondria. Cells respond by attempting to compensate through increased glucose uptake, leading to hyperglycemia, a hallmark feature of obesity and its associated conditions [406]. Similarly, dysfunctional transporters can compromise the efficiency of mitochondrial fuel utilization. This inefficiency leads to increased production of ROS, which damage cellular components and contribute to insulin resistance, a key factor in obesity development (Fig.3) [407].In conclusion, proper mitochondrial transporter function is critical for maintaining a healthy balance between energy expenditure and storage. Dysfunction in these transporters can disrupt metabolic processes and contribute to the development of obesity [408]. Further investigations into the distinct functions of various MTs and their potential use as therapeutic targets could aid in the treatment of metabolic diseases such as obesity.Impact of dysfunction of MTs on diabetesMitochondrial dysfunction plays a significant role in the development of type 2 diabetes, a chronic condition characterized by hyperglycemia due to impaired insulin action or secretion. In this process, disruptions in MTs and proteins responsible for shuttling metabolites in and out of the mitochondria play a key role [409,410]. Mitochondrial dysfunction disrupts glucose transporters, reducing skeletal muscle cells' ability to utilize glucose for energy production, a hallmark feature of diabetes, leading to insulin resistance and impaired glucose uptake (Fig.3) [411].Also, problems with mitochondria can affect transporters that help pyruvate leave the cell. This can cause more gluconeogenesis, a process that turns non-carbohydrates into glucose, which raises blood sugar levels [171]. As previously reported, carnitine transporters are essential for transferring fatty acids into mitochondria for breakdown, but defects can limit energy utilization, increase glucose reliance, and impair insulin signaling [412]. As with obesity, dysfunctional transporters can lead to the accumulation of harmful ROS within the mitochondria. The oxidative stress further damages pancreatic beta cells, leading to impaired insulin secretion and contributing to hyperglycemia (Fig.3) [413]. Briefly, research continues to explore the specific roles of different transporters and their potential as therapeutic targets to improve mitochondrial function and potentially manage or prevent diabetes.Key mechanism of MTs and Metabolic Switch in type 2 diabete (T2D)Mitochondrial metabolism impairment and its contribution to T2D progressionMitochondrial transporters play a crucial role in the metabolic switch observed in type 2 diabetes (T2D). Specifically, the mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC) imports pyruvate, a product of glucose breakdown in the cytoplasm, into the mitochondrial matrix for further oxidation through the Krebs cycle for ATP generation [414]. Studies have shown that dysfunction of MPC can contribute to insulin resistance, a hallmark of T2D [415]. Additionally, carnitine palmitoyltransferase (CPT) system is responsible for transporting fatty acids across the mitochondrial outer membrane. CPT1 isoforms explicitly recognize fatty acyl-CoAs, converting them to carnitine acylcarnitines for passage through the carnitine-acylcarnitine translocase on the outer membrane [382]. Once inside, CPT2 on the inner membrane reconverts them for mitochondrial uptake and beta-oxidation for energy production. Researchers have linked the development of T2D to disruptions in CPT1 and CPT2 function [416]. In short, when both the MPC and CPT systems don't work right, mitochondrial metabolism gets worse, ATP production drops, and metabolites like pyruvate and fatty acyl-CoAs build up in the cytoplasm. This can contribute to cellular stress, inflammation, and ultimately, insulin resistance, a key feature of T2D (Fig.3).Impaired MTs and their contribution to T2D progressionThe mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU) is critical for calcium uptake in mitochondria. Calcium imbalance is a feature of T2D, and MCU dysfunction can make it harder for mitochondria to work and make energy [388]. Various other transporters play a critical role. Citrate is a key intermediate in the TCA cycle and is essential for fatty acid synthesis and gluconeogenesis. If the mitochondrial citrate carrier (SLC25A1) doesn't work right, it can mess up glucose homeostasis and lipid metabolism, which can make insulin resistance and T2D worse [417]. In the context of Type 2 Diabetes, pro-inflammatory macrophage polarization is characterized by a metabolic shift within the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. Specifically, diminished activity of isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) and succinate dehydrogenase (SDH), the latter inhibited by itaconate, results in the intracellular accumulation of citrate and succinate. This metabolic perturbation leads to an increased generation of acetyl-CoA, subsequently driving enhanced synthesis of fatty acids and pro-inflammatory mediators. Furthermore, accumulated citrate and succinate contribute to the amplification of inflammation through modulation of gene expression, notably upregulating the production of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) and interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β), respectively. Succinate, derived from glutamine metabolism, impairs the function of mitochondrial electron transport chain complex II, inducing reverse electron transport (RET) and consequent ROS generation [418,419].The mitochondrial dicarboxylate carrier (SLC25A10) is crucial for keeping the redox balance and moving NADH from the cytosol to the mitochondria. Dysfunction of SLC25A10 can impair mitochondrial function and contribute to insulin resistance [411]. Furthermore, the oxoglutarate carrier (SLC25A11) gene exchanges mitochondrial 2-ketoglutarate with cytosolic malate. SLC25A11 is essential for maintaining the TCA cycle and supporting balanced biosynthesis. Impaired function of SLC25A11 can lead to metabolic dysfunction and contribute to the development of T2D [266]. Adenine nucleotide translocase (SLC25A4) problems have also been shown to cause less ATP synthesis and more oxidative stress. This can make insulin resistance and T2D worse. Issues with the mitochondrial phosphate carrier (SLC25A3) can also make it harder for mitochondria to make energy, which can also make T2D worse [418,419].Electron transport chain alterations and metabolic shifts in T2DVarious factors contribute to the molecular mechanisms underlying the metabolic switch. Scientists have found that AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1), an NAD+-dependent deacetylase, work together to control energy metabolism in skeletal muscle [420]. It has also been linked to pancreatic β-cell failure and T2D development. This is due to the peroxidation of mitochondrial membrane phospholipids, particularly phospholipase A2β (iPLA2β), which is found in islets and is known to be Ca2+-independent [421]. Also, more vascular smooth muscle cell growth in people with T2D has been linked to mitochondrial control of smooth muscle cell growth through Ca2+entry into mitochondria [422]. Mitochondrial dysfunction is a central feature of metabolic disorders like obesity and T2D [423]. The electron transport chain (ETC) within mitochondria, comprising complexes I–IV, is crucial for mitochondrial energy transformation [424]. Also, high blood sugar levels cause oxidative stress and DNA damage that are big parts of the pathophysiology of T2D. Changes in mitochondrial respiration in skeletal muscle of T2D patients suggest a possible link between mitochondrial function and the development of T2D [425,426].The metabolic switch observed in T2D involves a shift in cellular energy balance and metabolic pathways. AMPK activation in response to ATP depletion plays a role in switching cellular metabolism from ATP consumption to production [427]. Furthermore, studies have implicated the androgen receptor in coordinating muscle metabolic functions, impacting mitochondrial functions, and causing necrosis in skeletal muscle fibers [428]. Studies have shown also that bariatric surgery induces hypomethylation of genes related to T2D and insulin resistance, leading to improved metabolic parameters [429].ConclusionMitochondrial transporters (MTs) are central to metabolic dysregulation in type 2 diabetes (T2D). If the mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC) and carnitine palmitoyltransferase (CPT) system doesn't work right, it can mess up fatty acid oxidation and pyruvate import. These conditions can cause insulin resistance, fat buildup, and less ATP production. Impaired mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU) function exacerbates calcium imbalance and energy deficits. The citrate carrier (SLC25A1), the dicarboxylate carrier (SLC25A10), and the oxoglutarate carrier (SLC25A11) all mess up the TCA cycle and redox balance, which makes glucose homeostasis worse. When adenine nucleotide translocase (SLC25A4) and mitochondrial phosphate carrier (SLC25A3) don't work right, ATP synthesis slows down and oxidative stress rises. Citrate and succinate accumulate in individuals with type 2 diabetes because isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) and succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) are less active. This process leads to the production of fatty acids and inflammation. AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) dysregulation contribute to pancreatic β-cell failure. It is thought that mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and low electron transport chain (ETC) activity all play a role in the pathophysiology of T2D. This evidence shows how important MTs and MRs are in T2D (Fig.3).Impact of dysfunction of MTs on non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a growing health concern characterized by excessive fat accumulation in the liver unrelated to alcohol consumption. Mitochondrial dysfunction, particularly involving transporter proteins, plays a significant role in the development and progression of NAFLD [66].Dysfunctional carnitine transport proteins impede the translocation of long-chain fatty acids into the mitochondrial matrix, resulting in intracellular lipid accumulation and hepatic steatosis, a characteristic pathological feature of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) [430]. Perturbations in the mitochondrial citrate carrier, encoded by SLC25A1, disrupt glucose homeostasis and lipid metabolism by altering citrate availability for cytosolic processes, potentially contributing to insulin resistance and NAFLD pathogenesis [179]. The oxoglutarate carrier (OGC), facilitated by the SLC25A11 gene product, mediates the export of α-ketoglutarate from the mitochondrial matrix to the cytosol. SLC25A11 is crucial for maintaining tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle flux and biosynthetic pathways; impaired SLC25A11 function can induce metabolic dysregulation and contribute to NAFLD development. Furthermore, the mitochondrial phosphate carrier, encoded by SLC25A3, is responsible for inorganic phosphate import into the mitochondrial matrix, a critical step for ATP synthesis. Deficiencies in SLC25A3 function compromise mitochondrial energy production, potentially exacerbating NAFLD [213].Other research reported that problems with transporters that bring in pyruvate or send out Krebs cycle intermediates can stop the metabolic flow in liver cells. This makes the cells rely more on de novo lipogenesis, which causes fat to build up in the liver [431]. On the other hand, mitochondrial dysfunction causes too many ROS, which hurt cells and start inflammatory responses in the liver. This process also leads to NAFLD getting worse and turning into non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) [77]. Research continues to explore the specific roles of different transporters and their potential as therapeutic targets to improve mitochondrial function and potentially manage or prevent NAFLD progression.Impact of dysfunction of MTs on cancerMitochondrial transporter (MT) dysfunction as a driver of the Warburg effect in cancer metabolismCancer cells exhibit a unique metabolic profile known as the Warburg effect, characterized by a shift towards aerobic glycolysis for energy production even in the presence of oxygen. While less efficient than oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) in the mitochondria, aerobic glycolysis (AG) allows cancer cells to rapidly generate ATP and support their biosynthetic needs for proliferation [432]. Interestingly, mitochondrial transporter dysfunction is emerging as a key player in promoting this metabolic shift and contributing to cancer development and progression [433]. Also, changes or decreased activity of transporters that bring in pyruvate or fatty acids, which are the main building blocks for oxidative phosphorylation, can stop them from getting into the mitochondria. This forces cancer cells to rely more heavily on aerobic glycolysis for energy production, a hallmark of the Warburg effect [434,435].The role of MT dysfunction in cancer metabolism and adaptationThe dysfunction in transporters involved in exporting intermediates of the Krebs cycle can disrupt the normal flow within the mitochondria. As a result, some metabolites may build up and act as signaling molecules, encouraging the body's metabolism to change to aerobic glycolysis and helping cancer cells grow [436]. In addition, dysfunction in transporters responsible for exporting harmful ROS from the mitochondria can exacerbate oxidative stress. However, cancer cells can exploit this by utilizing the accumulated ROS as signaling molecules to activate survival pathways and promote resistance to therapy [437]. Conversely, dysfunctional transporters for essential nutrients like glucose or glutamine can impact cancer cell metabolism. Cancer cells, on the other hand, can adapt by upregulating alternative transporters or activating alternative metabolic pathways to ensure nutrient uptake and sustain their growth [29,438].Emerging evidence further implicates a broader range of SLC25 transporters in cancer metabolic reprogramming. SLC25A4 and SLC25A5, both members of the adenine nucleotide translocase family, are involved in ADP/ATP exchange across the mitochondrial inner membrane. While SLC25A4 is often downregulated in cancer to prevent apoptosis and conserve mitochondrial integrity, SLC25A5 (ANT2) is upregulated in proliferating tumor cells to meet the increased energy demand from glycolysis-derived ATP, representing a metabolic vulnerability [203,439]. Similarly, SLC25A6 (ANT3) is dysregulated in various malignancies and linked to apoptotic resistance. SLC25A31, another ATP/ADP carrier, is implicated in regulating apoptosis through the mitochondrial permeability transition pore and is under investigation as a therapeutic target in hematologic cancers [326,440].In conclusion, dysfunction of MTs emerges as a significant contributor to the MR observed in cancer cells. Understanding the specific roles of these transporters in cancer metabolism opens new avenues for developing effective therapeutic strategies to combat this complex disease.Key mechanism of MTs and metabolic switch in cancer cellsThe molecular mechanisms of mitochondrial transporters and metabolic switches in cancer cells are crucial for understanding cancer cells' altered metabolism and survival strategies. Mitochondrial dynamics and function play a significant role in cancer progression, with alterations in MTs impacting cellular metabolism and survival pathways [441]. The mitochondrial voltage-dependent anion channel 1 (VDAC1) in tumor cells helps control cell death and growth, which makes it a possible target for cancer treatment [442]. The SLC25 carrier family, responsible for transporting various molecules across the mitochondrial inner membrane [328], plays a vital role in mitochondrial physiology and pathology in cancer cells (Fig.4) [266].Fig. 4Overview on mitochondrial transporters and metabolic switch in cancer cells. Note that the pathophysiologic phenomenon is more complex than here depicted. Alterations in MTs, such as VDAC1, SLC25 family proteins, and glutamine transporters, contribute to tumor growth, metabolic adaptation, and resistance to stress. Upregulated transporters like citrate carrier (CIC) and dicarboxylate carrier (DIC) facilitate bioenergetics, lipid biosynthesis, and redox homeostasis, correlating with tumor aggressiveness and poor prognosis. The metabolic shift from OXYPHOS to glycolysis supports cancer cell survival, while mitochondrial calcium regulation and permeability transition pores (PTPs) influence cell fateFull size imageMTs and their role in tumor metabolismCitrate, a critical intermediate of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, plays a pivotal role in cellular bioenergetics, metabolic regulation, lipid biosynthesis, and epigenetic modulation. Upregulation of the mitochondrial citrate carrier, encoded by SLC25A1, has been observed in various malignancies, including acute myeloid leukemia, colorectal, breast, prostate, lung, and osteosarcoma, correlating with increased tumor aggressiveness and poor prognostic outcomes. When there are enough nutrients, CIC moves citrate from the mitochondria to the cytoplasm to help the body's fatty acid and lipid synthesis. When glucose and glutamine levels drop, this transporter protein helps TCA activity by moving citrate from outside the cell during metabolic stress [213]. Similarly, the dicarboxylate carrier (SLC25A10) is frequently overexpressed in solid tumors, such as osteosarcoma, lung, breast, ovarian, and gastric cancers, and its elevated expression is associated with diminished overall survival. This mitochondrial protein facilitates redox homeostasis and tumor proliferation by mediating malate and succinate transport [213,443]. The oxoglutarate carrier, SLC25A11, also exhibits increased activity in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), melanoma, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Loss-of-function studies suggest an oncogenic role for SLC25A11, as its ablation reduces tumor growth and metastasis. The oncogenic effects of SLC25A11 are mediated through signaling, metabolic, and antioxidant pathways [331,444].Transporters SLC25A12 (AGC1) and SLC25A13 (AGC2), which shuttle aspartate and glutamate, are also implicated in supporting nucleotide synthesis and redox homeostasis in tumors. Overexpression of SLC25A13 has been noted in hepatocellular carcinoma and pancreatic cancer, while SLC25A12 supports NADH shuttling critical for biosynthesis in gliomas [213,445]. Targeting these transporters may impair tumor proliferation and improve sensitivity to chemotherapy.These MTs are essential for shuttling metabolites between the mitochondrial matrix and cytosol, thereby integrating intracellular metabolic networks [266]. Notably, cancer cells often exhibit increased expression of glutamine transporters, specifically SLC1A5 and ASCT2 (Alanine, Serine, and Cysteine Transporter 2), both sodium-dependent transmembrane transporters, which are believed to be primary mediators of glutamine uptake [446]. These transporters facilitate the uptake of glutamine, which serves as a carbon and nitrogen source for biosynthesis, energy metabolism, and redox homeostasis maintenance in cancer cells [29].Role of mitochondrial transport mechanisms in cancer cell metabolism and survivalVarious metabolic pathways, including the citric acid cycle (CAC), which converts glutamine to glutamate and further metabolizes it to support energy production, depend on the transport of glutamine into cancer cells [29]. Additionally, the metabolic switch from oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) to glycolysis is a hallmark of cancer cells, optimizing their proliferation, growth, and survival [18].The mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) is a key regulator of cell death and has been associated with the c-subunit of the F1FO ATP synthase, highlighting its role in mitochondrial membrane transport and cell fate decisions in cancer cells [447]. Also, transporters like the mitochondrial Na+/Ca2+exchanger help move calcium around inside the mitochondria, which is important for controlling how cells use energy and send signals in cancer cells [448].ConclusionMitochondrial transporters (MTs) drive MR in cancer, particularly the Warburg effect, where cancer cells favor aerobic glycolysis over oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). Dysfunction of transporters like the mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC) restricts pyruvate entry, forcing reliance on glycolysis. Upregulated transporters such as the citrate carrier (SLC25A1), dicarboxylate carrier (SLC25A10), and oxoglutarate carrier (SLC25A11) promote lipid synthesis, redox homeostasis, and tumor proliferation. Glutamine transporters (e.g., SLC1A5, ASCT2) facilitate glutamine uptake, fueling biosynthesis and energy metabolism. Impaired ROS export increases oxidative stress, which cancer cells exploit for survival and therapy resistance. The mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) and voltage-dependent anion channel 1 (VDAC1) regulate cell death and growth, making them potential therapeutic targets. Other members of the SLC25 family, such as SLC25A4, SLC25A5, SLC25A6, SLC25A12, SLC25A13, and SLC25A31, also contribute to tumor energy homeostasis and survival signaling, offering a wide array of new therapeutic opportunities. These findings underscore the central role of MTs in cancer progression and metabolic adaptation (Fig.4).Targeting MTs and MR for disease treatmentMitochondrial transporters (MTs), which mediate the selective transport of key metabolites across the mitochondrial membrane, are increasingly recognized as critical regulators of disease-specific metabolic pathways [225]. Therapeutic strategies aimed at modulating MT activity offer several advantages over broader metabolic interventions. By targeting specific transporters, it may be possible to achieve more precise control of pathogenic metabolic fluxes with reduced off-target effects [449]. In oncology, selective inhibition of transporters such as the mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC) or the citrate carrier (SLC25A1) has demonstrated efficacy in preclinical models by limiting cell proliferation and metabolic plasticity [450]. Despite encouraging early data, major translational challenges remain. High selectivity and potency are required to target individual MTs effectively without disrupting global mitochondrial function [451]. Moreover, the disease-specific roles of individual transporters must be defined to inform therapeutic targeting strategies. Understanding how MTs interface with broader metabolic and signaling networks will be crucial for designing rational combination therapies [452]. Future research should prioritize identifying transporters with selective disease relevance and elucidating their mechanistic roles in MR. Integrating MT-targeted drugs with existing treatment modalities, such as chemotherapeutics or immunotherapies, may enhance therapeutic efficacy and overcome resistance mechanisms.In conclusion, targeting MTs and MR represents a novel and promising therapeutic frontier. Continued research efforts are necessary to overcome current challenges and translate this potential into effective clinical applications for a wide range of diseases [17].Targeting MTs and MR for neurodegenerative diseasesMitochondrial dysfunction and MR are hallmark features of numerous neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and Huntington's disease (HD). Research has increasingly focused on compounds that can target MTs and reprogram metabolic pathways as potential therapeutic strategies for these conditions [339]. Researchers have investigated MitoQ, SkQ1, MitoTEMPOL, and MitoVitE as the main mitochondrial-targeted antioxidants for AD treatment. These compounds have demonstrated neuroprotective effects in preclinical studies by reducing oxidative damage, improving mitochondrial function, and enhancing cellular energy metabolism [453].Researchers have investigated mitoquinone, also known as MitoQ, a mitochondria-targeted antioxidant, for its potential therapeutic benefits in AD treatment. It is a derivative of the naturally occurring antioxidant ubiquinone, also known as Coenzyme Q10, but with a modification that allows it to accumulate within the mitochondria, the cell's energy-producing organelles [454]. MitoQ reduces oxidative stress in the mitochondria. It does this by scavenging reactive oxygen species, the harmful by-products of cellular metabolism that can damage cellular structures and contribute to the neuronal degeneration seen in AD [356]. The organelle's large membrane potential forces the molecule to concentrate within the mitochondria. The enzyme complex II of the electron transport chain is believed to reduce (activate) MitoQ once it enters the mitochondria. The reduced form of MitoQ can then neutralize ROS, helping to maintain mitochondrial health and function [454].Studies have shown that MitoQ can help ameliorate mitochondrial dysfunction, reduce oxidative damage, decrease neuroinflammation, and improve cognitive function in animal models in the context of AD. Further, it may also help in reducing the accumulation of beta-amyloid plaques and tau tangles, the hallmark pathological features of AD. Furthermore, MitoQ has also shown efficacy in preclinical models of PD, reducing dopaminergic neuron loss [455].Researchers have investigated the potential therapeutic effects of SkQ1 (10-(6′-plastoquinonyl), a mitochondria-targeted derivative of plastoquinone, in the treatment of AD. It is a mitochondria-targeted antioxidant that aims to alleviate symptoms of AD by reversing mitochondrial deterioration and reducing oxidative stress [456]. SkQ1 treatment from the age of 19 to 24 months alleviated signs of neurodegeneration and improved locomotor and exploratory activities in OXYS rats, which simulate key characteristics of sporadic AD, according to a study. Studies have demonstrated that SkQ1 suppresses the development of AD signs and mitigates mitochondrial dysfunction [457]. It can alleviate damage induced by ischemia–reperfusion injury, inhibit the development of ophthalmological disorders, and exhibit anti-inflammatory activity. However, it is important to note that the therapeutic potential of SkQ1 in the clinical stages of AD is currently unknown [458]. We need further research and clinical trials to evaluate its efficacy and safety in human AD patients.MitoTEMPOL, a form of the nitroxide TEMPOL, has been shown to improve cognitive function, fix mitochondrial dysfunction, and lower oxidative damage in animal models. It may also have a role in reducing the accumulation of beta-amyloid plaques and tau tangles, the hallmark pathological features of AD [459]. Researchers continue to investigate the safety and efficacy of MitoTEMPOL in treating AD. Preclinical studies in animal models have yielded promising results, but human clinical trials are necessary to establish its safety profile and therapeutic potential in AD patients [460]. MitoVitE is a mitochondria-targeted antioxidant that shows promise in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. Studies have demonstrated its ability to mitigate oxidative stress, safeguard against mitochondrial dysfunction, and potentially enhance cognitive function [356]. However, further research is necessary to ascertain its efficacy and safety in clinical settings. Using small molecules like SS-31 (elamipretide), which binds to cardiolipin on the inner mitochondrial membrane, is another promising method. This stabilizes the structure of the mitochondria and increases ATP production [461]. SS-31 has demonstrated protective effects in models of AD, reducing amyloid-beta toxicity and preserving cognitive function [462].Agents that modulate mitochondrial dynamics and biogenesis, such as the SIRT1 activator resveratrol, have also gained attention. Resveratrol encourages mitochondrial biogenesis by turning on PGC-1α. This could improve motor function and slow down neuronal degeneration in HD models [463]. Also, scientists have looked into substances like nicotinamide riboside (NR), which is a precursor to NAD+, to see if they could improve the function of mitochondria and energy metabolism [464]. NR supplementation has shown promise in preclinical studies for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), potentially slowing disease progression through MR [465]. Collectively, these findings underscore the therapeutic potential of compounds targeting MTs and MR in neurodegenerative diseases. However, further research and clinical trials are necessary to translate these preclinical successes into effective treatments for patients [465]. The main molecules that target MTs or different pathways in their metabolic processes are summarized in the Table1.Table 1 Key agents targeting MTs and MR in neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs)Full size tableTargeting MTs and MR for cardiovascular diseasesThe scientific field has explored various approaches to target MTs and induce MR for cardiovascular diseases. The approaches include the development of small molecules, biomolecules, and nanomaterials that specifically target mitochondria [449]. We can design compounds to directly deliver therapeutic agents to the mitochondria, such as cytotoxic drugs, antioxidants, and imaging molecules. In brief, compounds targeting MTs and MR offer promising avenues for developing new therapeutic strategies for cardiovascular diseases. These compounds may help restore proper cellular energy balance and improve cardiovascular health by modulating mitochondrial function and metabolism [14].Small molecules and peptides enhancing mitochondrial functionScientists have discovered that humanin and other mitochondrial-derived peptides (MDPs) can protect cells from heart diseases by increasing mitochondrial function and decreasing oxidative stress [468]. Metformin, a widely used type 2 diabetes drug, has demonstrated potential cardioprotective effects through MR. It turns on adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK), which changes the metabolism of mitochondria, making the heart work better and lowering the risk of ischemic injury [469]. In addition, resveratrol is a natural compound found in grapes and certain plants that has been shown to activate sirtuin 1 (Sirt1), a protein involved in mitochondrial biogenesis and function. Researchers have linked the activation of Sirt1 by resveratrol to cardiovascular benefits, including improved mitochondrial function and reduced oxidative stress [470]. Furthermore, researchers have studied dexrazoxane for its cardioprotective effects by targeting mitochondrial function. Studies have shown that it can improve the function of mitochondria and lower oxidative stress in the heart, especially when anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity is present [471,472].Emerging compounds and nutraceutical interventionsOther promising molecules exist, as we discussed in the following paragraph. Nicotinamide riboside (NR) is a precursor of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+), a coenzyme involved in cellular metabolism. Preclinical studies have demonstrated that supplementing with NR can increase NAD+levels, improve mitochondrial function, and potentially have cardioprotective effects [464] MTP-131 is another mitochondria-targeting peptide that has demonstrated potential in preclinical studies for cardiovascular diseases. Studies have shown that it can improve mitochondrial function, lower oxidative stress, and protect against ischemia–reperfusion injury in the heart. This means that it may be useful for treating heart problems like myocardial infarction and heart failure [473]. Dietary supplements have used Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10), an essential component of the electron transport chain, to support cardiovascular health. It may improve heart function by enhancing mitochondrial ATP production and reducing oxidative stress [474]. As aforementioned, MitoQ is a mitochondrial-targeted antioxidant that has shown promise in preclinical studies for reducing oxidative stress and improving mitochondrial function in cardiovascular diseases. MitoQ's direct targeting of mitochondria may offer protective effects against endothelial dysfunction and atherosclerosis [475,476].Mitochondrial transporter dysfunction in cardiovascular disease modelsPrevious studies have begun to link mitochondrial transporter dysfunction with concrete cardiovascular disease models. For example, genetic mutations in SLC25A4 (ANT1), responsible for ADP/ATP exchange, are associated with dilated cardiomyopathy and exercise intolerance due to mitochondrial energy failure [418,477]. SLC25A3, a phosphate carrier essential for ATP synthesis, has been implicated in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in both mouse models and human patients [191]. Additionally, SLC25A20 deficiency impairs carnitine–acylcarnitine transport, leading to fatty acid oxidation defects and sudden cardiac death in infants [478]. These models demonstrate how mitochondrial transport failure contributes directly to cardiomyopathies.Targeting MTs for cardioprotectionBeyond inherited diseases, experimental models of pressure overload and ischemia–reperfusion injury show dysregulation of SLC25A5 (ANT2) and UCP2 expression, which alters mitochondrial membrane potential and energy efficiency. Targeting these transporters with modulators of ANT isoforms or UCP2 inhibitors has shown promise in restoring myocardial energy metabolism and limiting infarct size [479]. Similarly, inhibition of SLC25A1, the citrate transporter, reduced pathological remodeling in heart failure models by limiting lipid accumulation and ROS production [165,480].Conclusion and future directionsThe following table summarizes the different molecules with cardioprotective potential under preclinical studies or early clinical trials (Table2). Therefore, further research is necessary to fully understand their efficacy, safety, and optimal dosing for improving cardiovascular health through MTs and MR.Table 2 Key agents with cardioprotective effects through MTs and MRFull size tableTargeting MTs and MR for metabolic diseasesVarious metabolic diseases have implicated mitochondrial dysfunction in their crucial role in cellular metabolism. To address these diseases, scientists have been exploring specific compounds that can target MTs and induce MR [14]. Recent research has focused on designing mitochondrial-targeting molecules that can interact with specific transporters and modulate mitochondrial activity. Researchers can use these compounds to study and treat mitochondrial dysfunction in metabolic diseases such as type 2 diabetes, obesity, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). The goal is to develop compounds that can restore normal mitochondrial function and alleviate the underlying metabolic abnormalities [185,487].One approach involves the use of mitochondria-targeting vectors, such as sorbitol-based molecular transporters. Researchers designed these vectors to efficiently deliver bioactive cargos into mitochondria. By synthesizing and testing these transporters, researchers can assess their targeting efficiency and effectiveness in restoring mitochondrial function [488]. Furthermore, there is growing interest in developing organelle-specific compounds that can selectively target mitochondria. We can design these compounds to interact with specific metabolic pathways within mitochondria, thereby promoting MR and restoring normal cellular metabolism [17]. By targeting specific metabolic pathways, these compounds aim to correct the metabolic abnormalities associated with metabolic diseases.Targeting MTs and MR for type 2 diabetes (T2D)Researchers have investigated the potential of specific compounds targeting MTs and MR in the management of type 2 diabetes (T2D). These compounds aim to restore metabolic homeostasis, improve insulin sensitivity, and address the underlying metabolic dysregulation associated with T2D [489]. On the one hand, metformin, an oral antidiabetic drug, primarily inhibits mitochondrial complex I of the electron transport chain. This inhibition leads to a decrease in ATP production and an increase in adenosine monophosphate (AMP)/ADP levels, which activate AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). AMPK activation promotes glucose uptake, inhibits hepatic gluconeogenesis, and enhances fatty acid oxidation, leading to improved insulin sensitivity and reduced blood glucose levels [490,491]. Thiazolidinediones (TZDs), such as rosiglitazone and pioglitazone, are peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) agonists that are used to treat type 2 diabetes. By activating PPARγ, TZDs promote adipocyte differentiation and enhance insulin sensitivity. Furthermore, studies have revealed that they improve mitochondrial function and stimulate fatty acid oxidation in adipose tissue, which contributes to their therapeutic effects [492,493].Also, drugs that block sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2), such as empagliflozin and dapagliflozin, reduce the amount of glucose reabsorbed by the kidneys by blocking SGLT2 in their proximal tubules. This leads to increased urinary glucose excretion and subsequent improvement in glycemic control [494]. SGLT2 inhibitors also promote mild diuresis and modest weight loss [495]. Also, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP1) receptor agonists, like exenatide and liraglutide, work like GLP-1, a hormone that makes insulin flow, stops glucagon release, slows stomach emptying, and makes you feel full. These effects contribute to improved glycemic control, reduced postprandial glucose levels, and potential weight loss [496]. Another molecule, called dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors, stops the breakdown of incretin hormones like GLP-1. Examples of these are sitagliptin and saxagliptin. By inhibiting DPP-4, these compounds increase the half-life and activity of endogenous incretin hormones. This results in enhanced glucose-dependent insulin secretion, reduced glucagon release, and improved glycemic control [497].These compounds target specific aspects of MTs and metabolic pathways involved in glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity. By altering mitochondrial function, glucose absorption, insulin release, and other metabolic processes, these chemicals aim to restore metabolic homeostasis, improve glycemic control, and lessen insulin resistance in people with T2D. According to medical guidelines, healthcare professionals should supervise the use of these compounds.Targeting MTs and MR for obesityResearchers have investigated specific compounds targeting MTs and MR to see if they can help manage obesity. These compounds aim to modulate mitochondrial function and metabolic pathways to address the underlying metabolic dysregulation associated with obesity [498].Metformin is an oral antidiabetic drug that targets mitochondrial complex I, reducing ATP production and activating adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK). AMPK activation leads to increased fatty acid oxidation, decreased lipogenesis, and improved insulin sensitivity [499]. Metformin also affects MR by inhibiting glycolysis and promoting oxidative phosphorylation, potentially leading to weight loss and improved metabolic parameters in individuals with obesity [500]. Thiazolidinediones (TZDs), such as rosiglitazone and pioglitazone, are peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) agonists. Activation of PPARγ enhances adipocyte differentiation, improves insulin sensitivity, and alters gene expression related to glucose and lipid metabolism. These effects can lead to reduced adipose tissue inflammation, an improved lipid profile, and reduced insulin resistance in obese people [501,502]. Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists, which include liraglutide and exenatide, also work like the hormone GLP-1. They bind to and activate GLP-1 receptors, leading to increased insulin secretion, decreased glucagon release, slowed gastric emptying, and increased satiety. GLP-1 receptor agonists can contribute to weight loss by reducing food intake and improving glycemic control [503].Some medicines, like canagliflozin and dapagliflozin, stop the kidneys from reabsorbing glucose. We refer to these as sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors. Blocking SGLT2, these chemicals increase the amount of glucose that leaves the body through urine. This lowers blood sugar levels and has a mild diuretic effect. SGLT2 inhibitors can contribute to weight loss and improved glycemic control [504,505]. Bile acid sequestrants, such as colesevelam and cholestyramine, bind to bile acids in the intestines, preventing their reabsorption. This leads to increased cholesterol and bile acid synthesis, resulting in increased energy expenditure and reduced hepatic lipid accumulation. Bile acid sequestrants can help improve metabolic parameters and contribute to weight management [506,507]. These compounds target MTs, metabolic pathways, and appetite regulation to address metabolic dysregulation and promote weight loss in individuals with obesity. According to medical guidelines, healthcare professionals should supervise the use of these compounds.Targeting MTs and MR for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)Researchers have investigated certain compounds that target MTs and MR to see if they could help treat non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). These compounds aim to improve mitochondrial function, metabolic pathways, and liver fat accumulation [508].MitoQ is a mitochondria-targeted antioxidant that accumulates within mitochondria. By reducing mitochondrial oxidative stress, MitoQ improves mitochondrial function, decreases lipid peroxidation, and mitigates liver inflammation [509]. These effects help to ameliorate NAFLD by protecting against mitochondrial dysfunction and reducing liver fat accumulation [185]. Farnesoid X receptor (FXR) agonists, such as obeticholic acid, activate the farnesoid X receptor (FXR), which is a nuclear receptor that helps maintain bile acid balance. When agonists activate FXR, they improve mitochondrial function by increasing bile acid flow. This helps move lipids around and speeds up β-oxidation in the mitochondria. These effects reduce lipid accumulation in hepatocytes and improve mitochondrial function in NAFLD [510,511].When peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor agonists, such as fenofibrate, are present, they also turn on PPARα and PPARγ. These are nuclear receptors that manage inflammation and fat metabolism. PPAR agonists can reduce liver fat accumulation and inflammation by enhancing fatty acid oxidation, reducing hepatic lipogenesis, and promoting insulin sensitivity [512]. These compounds have shown potential for managing NAFLD by improving liver lipid metabolism and reducing hepatic steatosis. Researchers have also investigated the effects of metformin, an oral antidiabetic drug, on NAFLD. By targeting the mitochondrial complex, metformin reduces ATP production, activates AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), and improves insulin sensitivity. Metformin can lower hepatic lipogenesis, increase fatty acid oxidation, and lower liver fat accumulation in people with NAFLD by changing how mitochondria work and activating AMPK [513].Researchers have studied the potential of omega-3 fatty acids, such as eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid, in managing NAFLD. These fatty acids can reduce liver fat accumulation, inflammation, and oxidative stress. Omega-3 fatty acids modulate lipid metabolism, inhibit hepatic lipogenesis, and enhance fatty acid oxidation, contributing to improved liver health and reduced liver fat in NAFLD [514]. Researchers have developed several other molecules, such as elampretide, oltipraz, betaine, naringenin, and resveratrol, which share similar modes of action to those previously discussed. In conclusion, these compounds target MTs, metabolic pathways, and oxidative stress to improve mitochondrial function and address metabolic dysregulation in NAFLD. However, to fully understand the efficacy, safety, and optimal use of these compounds in NAFLD management, further research and clinical trials are necessary. Table3summarizes different mitochondrial and metabolic disturbance targeted therapies.Table 3 Key agents targeting MTs and MR in metabolic diseasesFull size tableTargeting MTs and MR for cancer cellsSpecific compounds targeting MTs and MR for metabolic cancer cells have been the focus of scientific research in the field of cancer metabolism. Mitochondria play a crucial role in cellular metabolism, and their dysfunction is often associated with cancer development and progression. Recent studies have revealed cancer cells' metabolic vulnerabilities and explored specific compounds that can target mitochondrial metabolism to inhibit cancer growth. These compounds aim to disrupt the altered metabolic processes in cancer cells and restore normal cellular metabolism [521].One approach involves targeting mitochondrial ATP production, as cancer cells heavily rely on mitochondrial ATP production for survival and proliferation. By selectively inhibiting ATP production in cancer cells, these compounds can potentially induce cell death and inhibit tumor growth [522]. Additionally, researchers are investigating the use of mitochondria-targeted molecules that can selectively affect mitochondrial function in cancer cells. By modulating specific metabolic pathways within mitochondria, these compounds aim to reprogram the metabolism of cancer cells and inhibit their growth [523]. The field of cancer metabolism is evolving rapidly, and scientists are continuously searching new insights into the metabolic alterations in cancer cells and developing novel strategies to target mitochondrial metabolism for precision medicine in cancer therapy. However, specific compounds that target MTs and induce MR in metabolic cancer cells can act through various mechanisms.Main mechanisms of molecules targeting MTs and inducing MR in metaboliccancer cellsSome compounds directly target specific enzymes involved in mitochondrial metabolism, leading to their inhibition. These compounds, by inhibiting enzymes involved in ATP production or other metabolic pathways, can disrupt the energy balance and MR in cancer cells [25]. Other molecules may affect the mitochondrial membrane potential, which is crucial for maintaining mitochondrial function. These compounds can impact mitochondrial metabolism and ATP production by altering the membrane potential [524]. Furthermore, certain drugs can promote mitochondrial biogenesis, which is the process of increasing the number and function of mitochondria in cells. These compounds, by enhancing mitochondrial biogenesis, have the potential to improve mitochondrial function and restore normal cellular metabolism [525].In addition, molecules can specifically target and modulate metabolic pathways within mitochondria, such as the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle or fatty acid oxidation [433]. By affecting these pathways, these compounds can induce MR and alter the energy metabolism of cancer cells. The literature has described many other mechanisms of action, including the generation of ROS within mitochondria. Increased ROS levels can disrupt mitochondrial function and lead to oxidative stress, which can selectively target cancer cells that already have high levels of oxidative stress [526]. Many compounds that target MTs and MR, a programmed cell death process, have also used the induction of apoptosis. By disrupting mitochondrial function or metabolic pathways, these compounds can induce apoptosis in cancer cells, leading to their elimination [527]. Nevertheless, it’s important to note that the specific mechanisms of action may vary depending on the compound, cancer type, and cellular context. To fully understand the precise mechanisms by which these compounds target MTs and induce MR in metabolic cancer cells, further research is necessary.Targeting MTs and reprogrammingSeveral MTs are key players in the metabolic rewiring of cancer cells. The mitochondrial pyruvate transporters (MPCs) facilitate the import of pyruvate, a crucial step for oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) in the mitochondria [528]. Studies have shown that compounds like UK5099 that block MPCs can make cancer cells more glycolytic, which could make them more susceptible to treatments that target this pathway [529]. In the same way, the α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex (KGDH) controls how another important metabolite enters the TCA cycle. KGDH inhibitors, such as CPI-613, are currently undergoing clinical trials to see if they can target cancers with mutations in this complex [530].Meanwhile, targeting MTs offers a unique strategy to disrupt the metabolic adaptations of cancer cells. By changing how these transporters move metabolites, researchers might be able to stop transporters that feed into OXPHOS and move cancer cells toward a more glycolytic state, which could make them more vulnerable to drugs that target glycolysis [531]. Furthermore, cancer cells often rely on mitochondrial metabolites for macromolecule synthesis. Disrupting their import through transporters could limit their ability to build essential components, while other cancers exhibit mutations in genes encoding specific transporters [532,533]. Targeting these mutations with specific inhibitors could offer a personalized medicine approach. Despite the promise, targeting MTs for cancer therapy faces challenges. The complex interplay between different metabolic pathways necessitates careful consideration of potential off-target effects [534]. Additionally, developing specific and potent inhibitors that can effectively target transporters within the complex mitochondrial environment remains a hurdle [532].In short, a deeper understanding of the transporter landscape in cancer cells can reveal new targets for therapeutic intervention. For successful clinical translation, it is critical to design more specific and potent inhibitors that can effectively target transporters within mitochondria [535]. Next, combining transporter inhibitors with other targeted therapies or chemotherapeutic agents may offer a synergistic effect for improved treatment outcomes [536]. Briefly, targeting MTs represents a promising new frontier in cancer therapy. This approach has the potential to overcome current therapeutic resistance and develop more effective treatment strategies by manipulating cancer cells' MR. Continued research efforts are needed to address the existing challenges and translate this exciting concept into successful clinical applications.Molecules targeting MTs and inducing MR in metabolic cancer cellsCurrently, several molecules have shown promising results in the field of targeting MTs and inducing MR in metabolic cancer cells. This review develops some of them in an illustrative manner, but the list is not exhaustive.Metformin primarily treats type 2 diabetes and has demonstrated potential in cancer treatment by inhibiting complex I of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. This action can lead to reduced mitochondrial ATP production, potentially starving cancer cells of energy [537]. Certain types of cancer cells have observed that fenofibrate, a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor agonist, induces mitochondrial dysfunction and promotes cancer cell death [538]. Furthermore, dichloroacetate (DCA) can shift cancer cell metabolism from glycolysis to glucose oxidation by inhibiting pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase. By promoting a more normal metabolic state, DCA can potentially reduce cancer cell proliferation and induce apoptosis [539]. IACS-010759, a small molecule inhibitor of oxidative phosphorylation, also targets mitochondrial complex I, which makes cancer cells make less ATP. It has shown promise in various cancer models, including acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and solid tumors [540].Lastly, but not enough, a selective inhibitor of mitochondrial complex II, thenoyltrifluoroacetone (TTFA), disrupts the electron transport chain, leading to decreased ATP production and increased production of reactive oxygen species, promoting cancer cell death [541]. Curiously, a mitochondria-targeted antioxidant, Mito-TEMPO, specifically targets mitochondrial oxidative stress, which is a key factor in cancer cell metabolism and survival. It has the potential to inhibit cancer cell growth and induce apoptosis by reducing oxidative stress [542]. Table4should elongate and summarize the list. However, these examples represent a fraction of the ongoing research into compounds that target mitochondrial function and metabolic pathways in cancer cells. It is important to note that while these compounds show promise in preclinical studies, further research and clinical trials are necessary to fully understand their efficacy and safety in cancer treatment.Table 4 Key agents targeting MTs and inducing MR in metabolic cancer cellsFull size tableLimitations on MR and its interference with disease treatmentDespite substantial progress, our current understanding of disease-associated metabolic reprogramming (MR) remains incomplete [562]. Most studies have focused on well-characterized pathways, such as aerobic glycolysis in cancer, while less attention has been given to alternative or context-specific metabolic rewiring strategies across different tissues and diseases. For instance, while glutamine metabolism has emerged as a central pathway in multiple cancers, the dependence on this substrate varies significantly by tumor type, genetic background, and microenvironmental context [562,563]. This heterogeneity complicates the generalization of metabolic targets and hampers the design of universally effective interventions.Many insights into MR are derived from in vitro models using cancer cell lines or immortalized cell systems, which often fail to replicate the metabolic complexity of living organisms. These models frequently lack stromal, immune, and vascular components that are critical for shaping metabolic interactions in vivo. For example, tumor-stroma metabolic symbiosis, where cancer-associated fibroblasts supply metabolites such as lactate or alanine, cannot be fully captured in monoculture systems [564]. Consequently, drugs targeting MR that show promise in vitro may not achieve the same efficacy in animal models or human patients.Technical limitations in metabolomics and flux analysisAlthough metabolomics and isotope tracing techniques have advanced, significant challenges persist in accurately quantifying dynamic metabolic fluxes in real time and within specific cellular subpopulations. Many current methods provide only snapshots of metabolite abundance without capturing temporal variations or cell-specific contributions within heterogeneous tissues [565]. Moreover, metabolic labeling experiments often require high levels of precision and can be influenced by cell culture artifacts, limiting their translatability. Such variability makes it difficult to interpret how MR truly evolves during disease progression or treatment.Limited integration with epigenetics and immune signalingMetabolic reprogramming is tightly intertwined with epigenetic and immune responses, yet many studies examine these systems in isolation. Metabolites such as α-ketoglutarate, acetyl-CoA, and SAM are known cofactors for epigenetic enzymes, linking MR to chromatin remodeling and gene expression regulation [566]. Similarly, lactate, succinate, and fumarate can modulate immune cell differentiation and function [567]. A fragmented approach to these systems impairs our ability to develop combinatorial therapies that target metabolism, immunity, and epigenetics in an integrated manner.Insufficient biomarkers for patient stratificationClinical application of MR-targeting therapies is hindered by a lack of validated metabolic biomarkers that can guide patient selection and monitor treatment response. For example, while IDH1/2 mutations are associated with 2-hydroxyglutarate production and serve as biomarkers in gliomas and leukemias, few other metabolic markers have reached clinical utility [568]. Without precise metabolic profiling, many therapeutic trials risk failure due to poor patient stratification or misinterpretation of treatment efficacy.Safety, toxicity concerns in targeting core metabolism, and recommendationsTargeting central metabolic pathways presents inherent risks due to their importance in normal tissues. For example, inhibitors of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation or glycolysis may impair cardiac, neuronal, or immune function, particularly under stress conditions [569]. Selective targeting of disease-specific metabolic adaptations without collateral toxicity remains a formidable challenge in drug development. This calls for more nuanced approaches, such as exploiting synthetic lethality or developing prodrugs that are selectively activated in diseased tissues. To overcome these limitations, future MR research must incorporate systems biology approaches, combining metabolomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and epigenomics in disease-relevant in vivo models. Spatial metabolomics and single-cell metabolic profiling could offer critical insights into tissue heterogeneity and cell–cell interactions. Moreover, designing rational clinical trials with better metabolic biomarkers and adaptive dosing strategies will be crucial for translating metabolic insights into effective therapies.General conclusion and perspectivesMitochondria are central to cellular metabolism and play critical roles in energy production, influencing the pathogenesis of diseases such as neurodegenerative disorders, cardiovascular diseases, metabolic disorders, and cancer [15]. MTs are essential for maintaining metabolic flux and energy dynamics, and dysregulation of specific transporters, such as the mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC) and citrate carrier (SLC25A1), contributes to energy deficits, oxidative stress, and metabolic dysregulation in various diseases [165]. The Warburg effect, characterized by a shift towards aerobic glycolysis in cancer cells, underscores the importance of MTs in tumor growth, with upregulated transporters and altered metabolic pathways supporting cancer cell proliferation and survival [213]. In neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s, mitochondrial dysfunction is linked to impaired glucose metabolism and increased oxidative stress, contributing to neuronal death and cognitive decline [339]. MTs also play a crucial role in cardiac function, where their dysfunction can lead to energy deficits and calcium dysregulation, exacerbating conditions such as heart failure and ischemic injury [570]. In metabolic disorders like type 2 diabetes and obesity, mitochondrial dysfunction leads to insulin resistance and impaired glucose utilization, and targeting specific transporters offers potential therapeutic strategies to restore metabolic balance [571]. This comprehensive review emphasizes the therapeutic potential of targeting MTs and metabolic pathways, highlighting compounds such as AMPK activators, antioxidants, and specific transporter inhibitors for their promising preclinical results in restoring metabolic homeostasis and mitigating disease progression [453,572]. In conclusion, targeting MTs and understanding MR presents a novel therapeutic frontier with the potential to significantly improve health outcomes across a range of diseases, necessitating continued research to translate these findings into effective clinical applications.Data availabilityNot applicable.ReferencesRambani V, Hromnikova D, Gasperikova D, Skopkova M.
