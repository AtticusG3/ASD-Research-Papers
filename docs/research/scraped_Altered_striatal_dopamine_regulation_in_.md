## Abstract

Dopaminergic signaling is essential for regulating movement, learning, and reward. Disruptions in this system are linked to neuropsychiatric disorders such as ADHD. ADGRL3, an adhesion G protein-coupled receptor highly expressed in the brain, is genetically associated with increased ADHD risk.

Abstract AbstractDopaminergic signaling is essential for regulating movement, learning, and reward. Disruptions in this system are linked to neuropsychiatric disorders such as ADHD. ADGRL3, an adhesion G protein-coupled receptor highly expressed in the brain, is genetically associated with increased ADHD risk.ADGRL3knockout in animals alters expression of dopaminergic markers and induces dopamine-related behavioral changes. However, its precise role in modulating dopamine signaling remains unclear. We investigated howADGRL3knockout affects striatal dopamine release in mice usingex vivofast-scan cyclic voltammetry andin vivofiber photometry with a dopamine sensor.Ex vivomeasurements showed increased electrically-evoked dopamine release across the striatum. Conversely,in vivorecordings revealed reduced task-induced dopamine signals in the nucleus accumbens during an operant fixed interval task. This reduction was not due to impaired dopamine availability, as amphetamine-evoked release was unchanged. These findings suggest ADGRL3 modulates dopamine release in complex ways via different pre- and postsynaptic mechanisms.
