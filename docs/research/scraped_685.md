## Abstract

Congenital hypothyroidism (CH) requires early diagnosis to prevent irreversible neurodevelopmental impairments. This study aimed to determine cutoff values for initial capillary thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), first venous TSH, and levothyroxine (LT4) dose at 6 months to differentiate between transient and permanent CH.
