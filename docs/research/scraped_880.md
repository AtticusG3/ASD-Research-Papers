## Abstract

Abstract:
Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a developmental disorder characterized by significant social communication impairments and difficulties perceiving and presenting communication cues. Machine learning techniques have been broadly adopted to facilitate autism studies and assessments. However, computational models are primarily concentrated on specific analysis and validated on private datasets in the autism community, which limits comparisons across models due to privacy-preserving data sharing complications. This work presents a novel privacy-preserving open-source dataset, MMASD as a MultiModal ASD benchmark dataset, collected from play therapy interventions of children with Autism. MMASD includes data from 32 children with ASD, and 1,315 data samples segmented from over 100 hours of intervention recordings. To promote public access, each data sample consists of four privacy-preserving modalities of data; some of which are derived from original videos: (1) optical flow, (2) 2D skeleton, (3) 3D skeleton, and (4) clinician ASD evaluation scores of children, e.g., ADOS scores. MMASD aims to assist researchers and therapists in understanding children's cognitive status, monitoring their progress during therapy, and customizing the treatment plan accordingly. It also has inspiration for downstream tasks such as action quality assessment and interpersonal synchrony estimation. MMASD dataset can be easily accessed at
