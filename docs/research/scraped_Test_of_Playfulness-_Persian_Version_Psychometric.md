## Abstract

Given that play is shaped by cultural contexts, a culturally adapted tool is essential for evaluating playfulness-the essence of play. This study aimed to examine the psychometric properties of the Persian version of the Test of Playfulness (ToP).
Participants included 225 children (146 boys, 79 girls; mean age = 57.3 ± 12.76 months) with typical development, autism spectrum disorder, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. The full sample was used for factor analysis, internal consistency, item analysis, and concurrent validity. Subsamples were used for rater reliability, discriminant validity, and developmental construct validity.
Exploratory factor analysis identified one factor for the extent and intensity scales, and two for the skillfulness scale. Rater reliability was excellent (ICC = 0.80-0.99). Internal consistency was good to excellent (α = 0.80-0.93). High correlations with the Children's Movement Motivation Questionnaire supported concurrent validity (
The Persian ToP demonstrated acceptable reliability and validity, supporting its potential utility in clinical and research contexts. Limitations included virtual data collection challenges, sampling bias from snowball recruitment, and the narrow age range.

Abstract AbstractAims:Given that play is shaped by cultural contexts, a culturally adapted tool is essential for evaluating playfulness-the essence of play. This study aimed to examine the psychometric properties of the Persian version of the Test of Playfulness (ToP).Methods:Participants included 225 children (146 boys, 79 girls; mean age = 57.3 ± 12.76 months) with typical development, autism spectrum disorder, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. The full sample was used for factor analysis, internal consistency, item analysis, and concurrent validity. Subsamples were used for rater reliability, discriminant validity, and developmental construct validity.Results:Exploratory factor analysis identified one factor for the extent and intensity scales, and two for the skillfulness scale. Rater reliability was excellent (ICC = 0.80-0.99). Internal consistency was good to excellent (α = 0.80-0.93). High correlations with the Children's Movement Motivation Questionnaire supported concurrent validity (r= 0.72-0.77). All scales significantly differentiated among groups, confirming discriminant validity. Only the skillfulness scale showed significant differences across age groups, supporting developmental validity.Conclusion:The Persian ToP demonstrated acceptable reliability and validity, supporting its potential utility in clinical and research contexts. Limitations included virtual data collection challenges, sampling bias from snowball recruitment, and the narrow age range.Keywords:Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder; autism; playfulness; psychometrics; test of playfulness.
