## Abstract

As a widely used pediatric anesthetic, sevoflurane presents a paradoxical neurodevelopmental risk during vulnerable brain maturation periods. This review synthesizes emerging evidence on sevoflurane-induced developmental neurotoxicity, with a focus on somatostatin (SST)-SSTR4 signaling and its downstream effects on synaptic integrity. Key findings reveal that sevoflurane exposure disrupts excitatory-inhibitory balance by upregulating hippocampal SST expression, suppressing glutamatergic synaptic markers (vesicular glutamate transporter 1 (vGLUT1), PSD95), and impairing cAMP/PKA signaling-a pathway essential for AMPA receptor trafficking and synaptic plasticity. Mechanistically, SSTR4 activation exacerbates synaptic dysfunction through adenylate cyclase (AC) inhibition, reducing cAMP levels and diminishing AMPA receptor phosphorylation. Primate and rodent models corroborate these effects, linking SST-SSTR4 dysregulation to long-term cognitive deficits. Single-nucleus RNA sequencing in macaques further identifies altered synaptic development genes after sevoflurane exposure. While preclinical data suggest SSTR4 modulation as a therapeutic target, causal relationships between sevoflurane, SSTergic signaling, and synaptic pathology remain unconfirmed. This work underscores the urgency of refining pediatric anesthesia protocols and developing neuroprotective strategies targeting the SST-SSTR4-cAMP/PKA axis. Future research should prioritize spatiotemporal profiling of SST dynamics, validation of SSTR4-specific interventions, and translational studies using non-human primate models to bridge mechanistic insights with clinical outcomes.

rapid onset, smooth induction, and rapid recovery characteristics, making it the anesthetic of choice in pediatric, geriatric, and outpatient procedures [ 1 ]. this volatile anesthetic is used extensively for both general anesthesia and maintenance, with a broad patient demographic that ranges from neonates to elderly patients [ 2 ]. despite its clinical utility, recent studies have raised concerns about the potential neurotoxic effects of sevoflurane, especially when administered during critical windows of brain development [ 3 ]. the developing central nervous system (cns) is particularly vulnerable to external factors such as general anesthetic, as neuronal growth, synaptogenesis, and network formation are highly sensitive to chemical disruptions [ 4 ]. one of the primary areas of concern is the impact of general anesthetics like sevoflurane on neurodevelopment in neonates and young children. clinical and preclinical studies have demonstrated that exposure to these general anesthetics during critical periods of cns development may lead to long-term cognitive deficits, behavioral impairments, and neurodegenerative changes [ 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 ]. these neurotoxic effects are thought to arise from anesthetic-induced disruptions in synaptic plasticity, neuronal apoptosis, and network stability within developing neural circuits [ 6 , 10 ]. however, the underlying molecular mechanisms of sevoflurane-induced neurotoxicity remain barely understood. further investigation is needed to elucidate these pathways. the neurons can be divided into excitatory and inhibitory neurons, with sevoflurane exerting its anesthetic effect by inhibiting excitatory neurons and activating inhibitory ones [ 2 ]. the delicate balance between excitation and inhibition is crucial for normal brain function [ 13 ]. any disturbance to this balance, such as that potentially caused by sevoflurane exposure, might contribute to the cognitive and affective dysfunction seen with anesthesia [ 14 ]. somatostatin (sst) neurons are a key component of the cns, playing a vital role in the regulation of neural activity and synaptic plasticity [ 15 ]. sst, a neuropeptide, is widely distributed across the brain, including areas such as the hippocampus, cortex, and basal ganglia, where it functions to modulate neuronal excitability and synaptic transmission [ 2 ]. sst receptors (sstr1-5), belonging to the g protein-coupled receptor family, exhibit distinct distribution patterns in hippocampal regions [ 16 ]. notably, accumulating evidence demonstrates that sstr4 serves as the predominant receptor subtype within the ca1 and ca3 subfields of the hippocampus [ 17 ]. among these, sstr4 has been identified as a crucial player in the regulation of synaptic plasticity, neurogenesis, and dendritic morphology [ 18 ]. our review aims to explore the involvement of sst neurons and sstrs, particularly sstr4, in the sevoflurane-induced neurotoxicity, with a focus on the underlying mechanisms that may contribute to the long-term cognitive impairments observed in animal models and human patients after exposure to general anesthetics. sevoflurane-induced developmental neurotoxicity overview of sevoflurane-induced neurotoxicity sevoflurane is the most commonly used general anesthetic in pediatric surgery [ 4 ]. with increasing clinical applications, its potential neurotoxicity risks have become a recognized and urgent public health concern. in january 2025, a secondary analysis of the gas study published in anesthesiology suggested that repeated general anesthesia exposures before the age of 5 might be associated with decreased intelligence scores [ 19 ]. numerous studies have confirmed that prolonged or repeated sevoflurane anesthesia in young animals can lead to damage in the developing central nervous system, resulting in long-term impairments in learning and memory [ 4 , 6 , 9 , 20 , 21 ]. our previous study has found that sevoflurane anesthesia may cause abnormal neurobehavioral development in young animals, though the specific mechanisms remain unclear [ 6 ]. to investigate the mechanisms underlying sevoflurane-induced long-term cognitive dysfunction, we conducted related preclinical studies. recent studies indicate that sevoflurane anesthesia may induce neurodevelopmental toxicity and subsequent cognitive impairment by upregulating sst expression and altering synaptic development-related genes [ 4 ]. early childhood represents a critical period for cognitive development, during which any factors affecting cns maturation may exert long term negative impacts on future cognitive performance [ 21 ]. therefore, investigating sevoflurane anesthesia’s effects on cognitive function and its underlying mechanisms holds significant scientific importance and clinical value for understanding how general anesthetics interfere with brain development and for developing effective clinical intervention strategies. cellular basis of sevoflurane anesthesia-induced developmental neurotoxicity in studies investigating the mechanisms of sevoflurane-induced immature brain injury, we found that sevoflurane anesthesia may upregulate hippocampal sst expression in macaques, accompanied by alterations in synaptic development-related genes, leading to neurodevelopmental toxicity and long-term cognitive dysfunction [ 4 ]. this finding prompted us to further explore the intrinsic link between sevoflurane neurotoxicity and synaptic development. through immunofluorescence staining experiments, we further observed significant downregulation of hippocampal psd95 and vglut1 following sevoflurane anesthesia, suggesting a reduction in glutamatergic synaptic density [ 22 ]. glutamatergic synapses, the primary synapses of excitatory neurons, serve as fundamental information-processing units in the cns, play critical roles in learning, memory, and emotional regulation, with precise control over their quantity and specificity of connections being essential for maintaining normal cns function [ 23 , 24 ]. previous studies have demonstrated that reduced glutamatergic synaptic density in the hippocampus may contribute to cognitive impairment, while enhancing glutamatergic synapse formation in the mouse hippocampus can mitigate sevoflurane-induced cognitive dysfunction [ 23 , 24 ]. animal studies demonstrate that sevoflurane exposure might upregulate sst expression, potentiating its inhibitory effects on glutamatergic pathways and consequently impairing synaptic plasticity [ 4 , 22 ]. dysregulation of this sst-glutamatergic crosstalk may represent a critical mechanism underlying anesthesia-induced cognitive deficits. these findings suggest that glutamatergic synaptic abnormalities may represent a key mechanism underlying sevoflurane-induced neurotoxicity in the immature nervous system. however, the specific mechanisms by which sevoflurane disrupts glutamatergic synaptic development remain an unresolved question that requires further investigation. moreover, sevoflurane might induce neurotoxicity through various mechanisms. previous study implicates microglial/astrocytic proliferation, elevated proinflammatory cytokine levels, and caspase activation as key contributors to sevoflurane-mediated neurodevelopmental toxicity via inflammatory cascades [ 11 ]. furthermore, sevoflurane potentially elevates systemic estradiol levels, enhancing region-dependent effects on gabaa receptors—increasing excitability in cortical areas while potentiating inhibition in caudal brain regions, synergizing with corticosterone to mediate neurotoxicity [ 12 ]. camp/pka signaling as a potential pathway in sevoflurane-induced synaptic dysfunction the precise structure and function of synapses depend on the coordinated action of multiple molecules and signaling pathways. among these, the cyclic adenosine monophosphate (camp)/protein kinase a (pka) pathway is recognized as a critical factor in maintaining the normal structure and function of excitatory glutamatergic synapses [ 25 ]. camp, a key signaling molecule, activates pka to regulate cellular functions through phosphorylation of target proteins [37]. in the central nervous system, the camp/pka pathway enhances synaptic excitability and plasticity by phosphorylating subunits of ampa receptors, thereby promoting their insertion into the postsynaptic membrane [ 26 ]. previous studies have shown that sevoflurane may impair cognitive function by inhibiting the camp/pka pathway [ 27 ]. during anesthesia, sevoflurane likely reduces intracellular camp levels and suppresses pka activity, leading to decreased phosphorylation of ampa receptors. this directly affects the number and functionality of ampa receptors on the postsynaptic membrane, ultimately resulting in diminished synaptic excitability. our preliminary experiments using western blot analysis found that juvenile mice exposed to sevoflurane represented no significant changes in total glua1 subunit protein levels in the hippocampus, but phosphorylation levels of the glua1 subunit were markedly reduced. these findings suggest that sevoflurane may impair neurodevelopment by disrupting excitatory synaptic function through the camp-pka pathway. to further elucidate this mechanism, we will investigate how sevoflurane modulates the camp-pka pathway and its specific impact on synaptic functional development. sst and its receptors involvement in sevoflurane-induced neurotoxicity sst involvement in sevoflurane-induced synaptic and cognitive deficits current studies on the mechanisms of anesthetic-induced brain developmental effects predominantly rely on rodent models. compared to rodents, non-human primates share up to 98% genetic similarity with humans, offering more accurate modeling of human pathophysiological conditions [ 4 ]. however, due to the high costs and limited availability of non-human primate (nhp) models, their use in investigating anesthetic-induced neurodevelopmental toxicity remains rare internationally [ 4 , 20 , 21 ]. to address this gap, we employed a primate anesthesia model and performed single-nucleus rna sequencing (snrna-seq) on macaque hippocampal tissues. based on snrna-seq results, we observed increased hippocampal sst gene expression following sevoflurane anesthesia [ 4 ]. gene ontology (go) and kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (kegg) analyses revealed that differentially expressed genes in neurons were strongly associated with synaptic transmission, calcium ion transmembrane transport, neurogenesis, and neuronal development [ 4 ]. our preliminary experimental data revealed that young mice exposed to sevoflurane showed a significant increase in hippocampal sst mrna and protein levels ( p &lt; 0.05), accompanied by a marked reduction in vglut1 mrna and protein expression ( p &lt; 0.01), as validated by real-time pcr and western blot analysis. these findings suggest that sevoflurane anesthesia may trigger neurodevelopmental toxicity and long-term cognitive impairment by upregulating sst expression and altering synaptic development-related genes. nevertheless, whether a causal relationship exists between sevoflurane-induced synaptic abnormalities and sst dysregulation, as well as the precise mechanisms involved, requires further exploration. sst, an inhibitory neuropeptide encoded by the sst gene, is widely expressed during embryonic development [ 28 ]. during neural development, sst regulates neuronal migration, differentiation, and synaptic formation/maturation [ 29 ]. functionally, sst serves as a marker for inhibitory interneurons, which synthesize and release this neuropeptide to modulate synaptic density in downstream pyramidal neurons [ 15 ]. excessive sst release from these interneurons can reduce synaptic density and impair cognitive function [ 23 ]. sst and its receptors in the hippocampus, sst primarily acts through five g protein-coupled receptors sstr1–5 [ 28 ]. sstrs are negatively coupled to ac, and sevoflurane-induced activation of sstrs (particularly sstr4) may suppress ac activity, thereby reducing intracellular camp levels [ 30 ]. in the hippocampus, sst has been identified within inhibitory interneurons primarily distributed across specific subregions - the stratum oriens layer of both ca1 and ca3 sectors, as well as the hilar zone of the dentate gyrus [ 18 ]. notably, this neuropeptide demonstrates spatial overlap with gabaergic signaling components [ 31 ]. molecular characterization reveals that four subtypes (sstr1-4) from the sst receptor family show significant expression patterns within hippocampal architecture, with particular abundance observed in principal neuronal populations including pyramidal cells and granule cell layer [ 15 ]. notably, studies have shown that sst and sstr4 agonists impair spatial memory formation in a dose-dependent manner, whereas agonists of sstr1, sstr2, or sstr3 elicit no significant behavioral effects [ 18 ]. this highlights the critical role of sstr4 in synaptic plasticity and cognitive regulation. although sstr4 has been implicated in neurodevelopment, synaptic plasticity, and cognition, its specific role in anesthesia-induced cognitive deficits remains underexplored [ 18 ]. building on the findings above and our earlier hypotheses, we propose the following questions: does sevoflurane impair glutamatergic synaptic function and cognition by modulating sst neurons and downstream sstr4 signaling? is sstr4 a key mediator of sevoflurane-induced neurotoxicity? could targeting sstr4 serve as a therapeutic strategy to mitigate cognitive deficits? addressing these questions will provide critical insights into the mechanisms of anesthetic neurotoxicity and guide the development of targeted interventions. conclusions this comprehensive review synthesizes emerging evidence on sevoflurane-induced developmental neurotoxicity, emphasizing its potential to disrupt critical neurodevelopmental processes and long-term cognitive function. as a widely used pediatric anesthetic, sevoflurane poses paradoxical risks during vulnerable periods of brain maturation, where its neurotoxic effects may manifest through dysregulation of synaptic development, glutamatergic signaling, and inhibitory neuromodulation [ 1 ]. key findings highlight the role of sst and sstr4 in mediating anesthesia-related synaptic dysfunction. experimental data from primate and rodent models demonstrate that sevoflurane exposure upregulates hippocampal sst expression, reduces glutamatergic synaptic markers vglut1 and psd95, and impairs camp/pka signaling—a pathway critical for synaptic plasticity and ampa receptor trafficking [ 4 , 22 ]. these alterations correlate with behavioral deficits in learning and memory, suggesting a mechanistic link between sst-sstr4 signaling dysregulation and anesthesia-induced cognitive decline. however, current evidence is predominantly derived from animal models, and correlating these findings with human brain pathophysiology poses significant constraints due to fundamental interspecies differences, notably in blood-brain barrier properties and distinct neurodevelopmental timelines. future studies should prioritize validating preclinical conclusions through clinical data acquisition, including longitudinal pediatric cohort follow-ups and investigations leveraging neuroimaging and fluid biomarkers. future investigations should prioritize establishing causal relationships between somatostatin signaling and sevoflurane neurotoxicity through sstr knockout models to dissect receptor-specific contributions across developmental stages, coupled with behavioral phenotyping and molecular profiling of apoptosis/neuroinflammation. pharmacological interventions using sstr agonists/antagonists must be systematically evaluated for dose-dependent neuroprotection in preclinical models, assessing histopathological (neuronal loss, synaptic integrity) and functional outcomes. critical mechanistic insights will require deciphering sst-glutamate crosstalk in vulnerable circuits via optogenetics and multi-electrode recordings to map anesthesia-induced excitatory-inhibitory imbalance. preclinical data suggest that targeting sstergic pathways may represent a potential strategy. however, its clinical translatability requires further validation based on current evidence. by integrating molecular, cellular, and behavioral insights, this review advances our understanding of sevoflurane neurotoxicity and provides a framework for mitigating its long-term consequences on cognitive health. further research is needed to elucidate the precise molecular mechanisms by which sstr4 and other sst receptors influence neuronal function and synaptic plasticity in the context of anesthetic exposure. future studies could explore the potential of sstr4 antagonists or agonists as therapeutic interventions for preventing or mitigating the neurotoxic effects of sevoflurane, particularly in vulnerable populations such as neonates and young children. data availability no datasets were generated or analysed during the current study. abbreviations cns: central nervous system sst: somatostatin camp: cyclic

used general anesthetic known for its rapid onset, smooth induction, and rapid recovery characteristics, making it the anesthetic of choice in pediatric, geriatric, and outpatient procedures [ 1 ]. this volatile anesthetic is used extensively for both general anesthesia and maintenance, with a broad patient demographic that ranges from neonates to elderly patients [ 2 ]. despite its clinical utility, recent studies have raised concerns about the potential neurotoxic effects of sevoflurane, especially when administered during critical windows of brain development [ 3 ]. the developing central nervous system (cns) is particularly vulnerable to external factors such as general anesthetic, as neuronal growth, synaptogenesis, and network formation are highly sensitive to chemical disruptions [ 4 ]. one of the primary areas of concern is the impact of general anesthetics like sevoflurane on neurodevelopment in neonates and young children. clinical and preclinical studies have demonstrated that exposure to these general anesthetics during critical periods of cns development may lead to long-term cognitive deficits, behavioral impairments, and neurodegenerative changes [ 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 ]. these neurotoxic effects are thought to arise from anesthetic-induced disruptions in synaptic plasticity, neuronal apoptosis, and network stability within developing neural circuits [ 6 , 10 ]. however, the underlying molecular mechanisms of sevoflurane-induced neurotoxicity remain barely understood. further investigation is needed to elucidate these pathways. the neurons can be divided into excitatory and inhibitory neurons, with sevoflurane exerting its anesthetic effect by inhibiting excitatory neurons and activating inhibitory ones [ 2 ]. the delicate balance between excitation and inhibition is crucial for normal brain function [ 13 ]. any disturbance to this balance, such as that potentially caused by sevoflurane exposure, might contribute to the cognitive and affective dysfunction seen with anesthesia [ 14 ]. somatostatin (sst) neurons are a key component of the cns, playing a vital role in the regulation of neural activity and synaptic plasticity [ 15 ]. sst, a neuropeptide, is widely distributed across the brain, including areas such as the hippocampus, cortex, and basal ganglia, where it functions to modulate neuronal excitability and synaptic transmission [ 2 ]. sst receptors (sstr1-5), belonging to the g protein-coupled receptor family, exhibit distinct distribution patterns in hippocampal regions [ 16 ]. notably, accumulating evidence demonstrates that sstr4 serves as the predominant receptor subtype within the ca1 and ca3 subfields of the hippocampus [ 17 ]. among these, sstr4 has been identified as a crucial player in the regulation of synaptic plasticity, neurogenesis, and dendritic morphology [ 18 ]. our review aims to explore the involvement of sst neurons and sstrs, particularly sstr4, in the sevoflurane-induced neurotoxicity, with a focus on the underlying mechanisms that may contribute to the long-term cognitive impairments observed in animal models and human patients after exposure to general anesthetics. sevoflurane-induced developmental neurotoxicity overview of sevoflurane-induced neurotoxicity sevoflurane is the most commonly used general anesthetic in pediatric surgery [ 4 ]. with increasing clinical applications, its potential neurotoxicity risks have become a recognized and urgent public health concern. in january 2025, a secondary analysis of the gas study published in anesthesiology suggested that repeated general anesthesia exposures before the age of 5 might be associated with decreased intelligence scores [ 19 ]. numerous studies have confirmed that prolonged or repeated sevoflurane anesthesia in young animals can lead to damage in the developing central nervous system, resulting in long-term impairments in learning and memory [ 4 , 6 , 9 , 20 , 21 ]. our previous study has found that sevoflurane anesthesia may cause abnormal neurobehavioral development in young animals, though the specific mechanisms remain unclear [ 6 ]. to investigate the mechanisms underlying sevoflurane-induced long-term cognitive dysfunction, we conducted related preclinical studies. recent studies indicate that sevoflurane anesthesia may induce neurodevelopmental toxicity and subsequent cognitive impairment by upregulating sst expression and altering synaptic development-related genes [ 4 ]. early childhood represents a critical period for cognitive development, during which any factors affecting cns maturation may exert long term negative impacts on future cognitive performance [ 21 ]. therefore, investigating sevoflurane anesthesia’s effects on cognitive function and its underlying mechanisms holds significant scientific importance and clinical value for understanding how general anesthetics interfere with brain development and for developing effective clinical intervention strategies. cellular basis of sevoflurane anesthesia-induced developmental neurotoxicity in studies investigating the mechanisms of sevoflurane-induced immature brain injury, we found that sevoflurane anesthesia may upregulate hippocampal sst expression in macaques, accompanied by alterations in synaptic development-related genes, leading to neurodevelopmental toxicity and long-term cognitive dysfunction [ 4 ]. this finding prompted us to further explore the intrinsic link between sevoflurane neurotoxicity and synaptic development. through immunofluorescence staining experiments, we further observed significant downregulation of hippocampal psd95 and vglut1 following sevoflurane anesthesia, suggesting a reduction in glutamatergic synaptic density [ 22 ]. glutamatergic synapses, the primary synapses of excitatory neurons, serve as fundamental information-processing units in the cns, play critical roles in learning, memory, and emotional regulation, with precise control over their quantity and specificity of connections being essential for maintaining normal cns function [ 23 , 24 ]. previous studies have demonstrated that reduced glutamatergic synaptic density in the hippocampus may contribute to cognitive impairment, while enhancing glutamatergic synapse formation in the mouse hippocampus can mitigate sevoflurane-induced cognitive dysfunction [ 23 , 24 ]. animal studies demonstrate that sevoflurane exposure might upregulate sst expression, potentiating its inhibitory effects on glutamatergic pathways and consequently impairing synaptic plasticity [ 4 , 22 ]. dysregulation of this sst-glutamatergic crosstalk may represent a critical mechanism underlying anesthesia-induced cognitive deficits. these findings suggest that glutamatergic synaptic abnormalities may represent a key mechanism underlying sevoflurane-induced neurotoxicity in the immature nervous system. however, the specific mechanisms by which sevoflurane disrupts glutamatergic synaptic development remain an unresolved question that requires further investigation. moreover, sevoflurane might induce neurotoxicity through various mechanisms. previous study implicates microglial/astrocytic proliferation, elevated proinflammatory cytokine levels, and caspase activation as key contributors to sevoflurane-mediated neurodevelopmental toxicity via inflammatory cascades [ 11 ]. furthermore, sevoflurane potentially elevates systemic estradiol levels, enhancing region-dependent effects on gabaa receptors—increasing excitability in cortical areas while potentiating inhibition in caudal brain regions, synergizing with corticosterone to mediate neurotoxicity [ 12 ]. camp/pka signaling as a potential pathway in sevoflurane-induced synaptic dysfunction the precise structure and function of synapses depend on the coordinated action of multiple molecules and signaling pathways. among these, the cyclic adenosine monophosphate (camp)/protein kinase a (pka) pathway is recognized as a critical factor in maintaining the normal structure and function of excitatory glutamatergic synapses [ 25 ]. camp, a key signaling molecule, activates pka to regulate cellular functions through phosphorylation of target proteins [37]. in the central nervous system, the camp/pka pathway enhances synaptic excitability and plasticity by phosphorylating subunits of ampa receptors, thereby promoting their insertion into the postsynaptic membrane [ 26 ]. previous studies have shown that sevoflurane may impair cognitive function by inhibiting the camp/pka pathway [ 27 ]. during anesthesia, sevoflurane likely reduces intracellular camp levels and suppresses pka activity, leading to decreased phosphorylation of ampa receptors. this directly affects the number and functionality of ampa receptors on the postsynaptic membrane, ultimately resulting in diminished synaptic excitability. our preliminary experiments using western blot analysis found that juvenile mice exposed to sevoflurane represented no significant changes in total glua1 subunit protein levels in the hippocampus, but phosphorylation levels of the glua1 subunit were markedly reduced. these findings suggest that sevoflurane may impair neurodevelopment by disrupting excitatory synaptic function through the camp-pka pathway. to further elucidate this mechanism, we will investigate how sevoflurane modulates the camp-pka pathway and its specific impact on synaptic functional development. sst and its receptors involvement in sevoflurane-induced neurotoxicity sst involvement in sevoflurane-induced synaptic and cognitive deficits current studies on the mechanisms of anesthetic-induced brain developmental effects predominantly rely on rodent models. compared to rodents, non-human primates share up to 98% genetic similarity with humans, offering more accurate modeling of human pathophysiological conditions [ 4 ]. however, due to the high costs and limited availability of non-human primate (nhp) models, their use in investigating anesthetic-induced neurodevelopmental toxicity remains rare internationally [ 4 , 20 , 21 ]. to address this gap, we employed a primate anesthesia model and performed single-nucleus rna sequencing (snrna-seq) on macaque hippocampal tissues. based on snrna-seq results, we observed increased hippocampal sst gene expression following sevoflurane anesthesia [ 4 ]. gene ontology (go) and kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (kegg) analyses revealed that differentially expressed genes in neurons were strongly associated with synaptic transmission, calcium ion transmembrane transport, neurogenesis, and neuronal development [ 4 ]. our preliminary experimental data revealed that young mice exposed to sevoflurane showed a significant increase in hippocampal sst mrna and protein levels ( p &lt; 0.05), accompanied by a marked reduction in vglut1 mrna and protein expression ( p &lt; 0.01), as validated by real-time pcr and western blot analysis. these findings suggest that sevoflurane anesthesia may trigger neurodevelopmental toxicity and long-term cognitive impairment by upregulating sst expression and altering synaptic development-related genes. nevertheless, whether a causal relationship exists between sevoflurane-induced synaptic abnormalities and sst dysregulation, as well as the precise mechanisms involved, requires further exploration. sst, an inhibitory neuropeptide encoded by the sst gene, is widely expressed during embryonic development [ 28 ]. during neural development, sst regulates neuronal migration, differentiation, and synaptic formation/maturation [ 29 ]. functionally, sst serves as a marker for inhibitory interneurons, which synthesize and release this neuropeptide to modulate synaptic density in downstream pyramidal neurons [ 15 ]. excessive sst release from these interneurons can reduce synaptic density and impair cognitive function [ 23 ]. sst and its receptors in the hippocampus, sst primarily acts through five g protein-coupled receptors sstr1–5 [ 28 ]. sstrs are negatively coupled to ac, and sevoflurane-induced activation of sstrs (particularly sstr4) may suppress ac activity, thereby reducing intracellular camp levels [ 30 ]. in the hippocampus, sst has been identified within inhibitory interneurons primarily distributed across specific subregions - the stratum oriens layer of both ca1 and ca3 sectors, as well as the hilar zone of the dentate gyrus [ 18 ]. notably, this neuropeptide demonstrates spatial overlap with gabaergic signaling components [ 31 ]. molecular characterization reveals that four subtypes (sstr1-4) from the sst receptor family show significant expression patterns within hippocampal architecture, with particular abundance observed in principal neuronal populations including pyramidal cells and granule cell layer [ 15 ]. notably, studies have shown that sst and sstr4 agonists impair spatial memory formation in a dose-dependent manner, whereas agonists of sstr1, sstr2, or sstr3 elicit no significant behavioral effects [ 18 ]. this highlights the critical role of sstr4 in synaptic plasticity and cognitive regulation. although sstr4 has been implicated in neurodevelopment, synaptic plasticity, and cognition, its specific role in anesthesia-induced cognitive deficits remains underexplored [ 18 ]. building on the findings above and our earlier hypotheses, we propose the following questions: does sevoflurane impair glutamatergic synaptic function and cognition by modulating sst neurons and downstream sstr4 signaling? is sstr4 a key mediator of sevoflurane-induced neurotoxicity? could targeting sstr4 serve as a therapeutic strategy to mitigate cognitive deficits? addressing these questions will provide critical insights into the mechanisms of anesthetic neurotoxicity and guide the development of targeted interventions. conclusions this comprehensive review synthesizes emerging evidence on sevoflurane-induced developmental neurotoxicity, emphasizing its potential to disrupt critical neurodevelopmental processes and long-term cognitive function. as a widely used pediatric anesthetic, sevoflurane poses paradoxical risks during vulnerable periods of brain maturation, where its neurotoxic effects may manifest through dysregulation of synaptic development, glutamatergic signaling, and inhibitory neuromodulation [ 1 ]. key findings highlight the role of sst and sstr4 in mediating anesthesia-related synaptic dysfunction. experimental data from primate and rodent models demonstrate that sevoflurane exposure upregulates hippocampal sst expression, reduces glutamatergic synaptic markers vglut1 and psd95, and impairs camp/pka signaling—a pathway critical for synaptic plasticity and ampa receptor trafficking [ 4 , 22 ]. these alterations correlate with behavioral deficits in learning and memory, suggesting a mechanistic link between sst-sstr4 signaling dysregulation and anesthesia-induced cognitive decline. however, current evidence is predominantly derived from animal models, and correlating these findings with human brain pathophysiology poses significant constraints due to fundamental interspecies differences, notably in blood-brain barrier properties and distinct neurodevelopmental timelines. future studies should prioritize validating preclinical conclusions through clinical data acquisition, including longitudinal pediatric cohort follow-ups and investigations leveraging neuroimaging and fluid biomarkers. future investigations should prioritize establishing causal relationships between somatostatin signaling and sevoflurane neurotoxicity through sstr knockout models to dissect receptor-specific contributions across developmental stages, coupled with behavioral phenotyping and molecular profiling of apoptosis/neuroinflammation. pharmacological interventions using sstr agonists/antagonists must be systematically evaluated for dose-dependent neuroprotection in preclinical models, assessing histopathological (neuronal loss, synaptic integrity) and functional outcomes. critical mechanistic insights will require deciphering sst-glutamate crosstalk in vulnerable circuits via optogenetics and multi-electrode recordings to map anesthesia-induced excitatory-inhibitory imbalance. preclinical data suggest that targeting sstergic pathways may represent a potential strategy. however, its clinical translatability requires further validation based on current evidence. by integrating molecular, cellular, and behavioral insights, this review advances our understanding of sevoflurane neurotoxicity and provides a framework for mitigating its long-term consequences on cognitive health. further research is needed to elucidate the precise molecular mechanisms by which sstr4 and other sst receptors influence neuronal function and synaptic plasticity in the context of anesthetic exposure. future studies could explore the potential of sstr4 antagonists or agonists as therapeutic interventions for preventing or mitigating the neurotoxic effects of sevoflurane, particularly in vulnerable populations such as neonates and young children. data availability no datasets were generated or analysed during the current study. abbreviations cns: central nervous system sst: somatostatin camp: cyclic

## Results
reveal that sevoflurane exposure disrupts excitatory-inhibitory balance by upregulating hippocampal sst expression, suppressing glutamatergic synaptic markers (vesicular glutamate transporter 1 (vglut1), psd95), and impairing camp/pka signaling—a pathway essential for ampa receptor trafficking and synaptic plasticity. mechanistically, sstr4 activation exacerbates synaptic dysfunction through adenylate cyclase (ac) inhibition, reducing camp levels and diminishing ampa receptor phosphorylation. primate and rodent models corroborate these effects, linking sst-sstr4 dysregulation to long-term cognitive deficits. single-nucleus rna sequencing in macaques further identifies altered synaptic development genes after sevoflurane exposure. while preclinical data suggest sstr4 modulation as a therapeutic target, causal relationships between sevoflurane, sstergic signaling, and synaptic pathology remain unconfirmed. this work underscores the urgency of refining pediatric anesthesia protocols and developing neuroprotective strategies targeting the sst-sstr4-camp/pka axis. future research should prioritize spatiotemporal profiling of sst dynamics, validation of sstr4-specific interventions, and translational studies using non-human primate models to bridge mechanistic insights with clinical outcomes.","datepublished":"2025-08-09t00:00:00z","datemodified":"2025-08-09t00:00:00z","pagestart":"1","pageend":"6","license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","sameas":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12871-025-03242-4","keywords":["sevoflurane","developmental

used general anesthetic known for its rapid onset, smooth induction, and rapid recovery characteristics, making it the anesthetic of choice in pediatric, geriatric, and outpatient procedures [ 1 ]. this volatile anesthetic is used extensively for both general anesthesia and maintenance, with a broad patient demographic that ranges from neonates to elderly patients [ 2 ]. despite its clinical utility, recent studies have raised concerns about the potential neurotoxic effects of sevoflurane, especially when administered during critical windows of brain development [ 3 ]. the developing central nervous system (cns) is particularly vulnerable to external factors such as general anesthetic, as neuronal growth, synaptogenesis, and network formation are highly sensitive to chemical disruptions [ 4 ]. one of the primary areas of concern is the impact of general anesthetics like sevoflurane on neurodevelopment in neonates and young children. clinical and preclinical studies have demonstrated that exposure to these general anesthetics during critical periods of cns development may lead to long-term cognitive deficits, behavioral impairments, and neurodegenerative changes [ 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 ]. these neurotoxic effects are thought to arise from anesthetic-induced disruptions in synaptic plasticity, neuronal apoptosis, and network stability within developing neural circuits [ 6 , 10 ]. however, the underlying molecular mechanisms of sevoflurane-induced neurotoxicity remain barely understood. further investigation is needed to elucidate these pathways. the neurons can be divided into excitatory and inhibitory neurons, with sevoflurane exerting its anesthetic effect by inhibiting excitatory neurons and activating inhibitory ones [ 2 ]. the delicate balance between excitation and inhibition is crucial for normal brain function [ 13 ]. any disturbance to this balance, such as that potentially caused by sevoflurane exposure, might contribute to the cognitive and affective dysfunction seen with anesthesia [ 14 ]. somatostatin (sst) neurons are a key component of the cns, playing a vital role in the regulation of neural activity and synaptic plasticity [ 15 ]. sst, a neuropeptide, is widely distributed across the brain, including areas such as the hippocampus, cortex, and basal ganglia, where it functions to modulate neuronal excitability and synaptic transmission [ 2 ]. sst receptors (sstr1-5), belonging to the g protein-coupled receptor family, exhibit distinct distribution patterns in hippocampal regions [ 16 ]. notably, accumulating evidence demonstrates that sstr4 serves as the predominant receptor subtype within the ca1 and ca3 subfields of the hippocampus [ 17 ]. among these, sstr4 has been identified as a crucial player in the regulation of synaptic plasticity, neurogenesis, and dendritic morphology [ 18 ]. our review aims to explore the involvement of sst neurons and sstrs, particularly sstr4, in the sevoflurane-induced neurotoxicity, with a focus on the underlying mechanisms that may contribute to the long-term cognitive impairments observed in animal models and human patients after exposure to general anesthetics. sevoflurane-induced developmental neurotoxicity overview of sevoflurane-induced neurotoxicity sevoflurane is the most commonly used general anesthetic in pediatric surgery [ 4 ]. with increasing clinical applications, its potential neurotoxicity risks have become a recognized and urgent public health concern. in january 2025, a secondary analysis of the gas study published in anesthesiology suggested that repeated general anesthesia exposures before the age of 5 might be associated with decreased intelligence scores [ 19 ]. numerous studies have confirmed that prolonged or repeated sevoflurane anesthesia in young animals can lead to damage in the developing central nervous system, resulting in long-term impairments in learning and memory [ 4 , 6 , 9 , 20 , 21 ]. our previous study has found that sevoflurane anesthesia may cause abnormal neurobehavioral development in young animals, though the specific mechanisms remain unclear [ 6 ]. to investigate the mechanisms underlying sevoflurane-induced long-term cognitive dysfunction, we conducted related preclinical studies. recent studies indicate that sevoflurane anesthesia may induce neurodevelopmental toxicity and subsequent cognitive impairment by upregulating sst expression and altering synaptic development-related genes [ 4 ]. early childhood represents a critical period for cognitive development, during which any factors affecting cns maturation may exert long term negative impacts on future cognitive performance [ 21 ]. therefore, investigating sevoflurane anesthesia’s effects on cognitive function and its underlying mechanisms holds significant scientific importance and clinical value for understanding how general anesthetics interfere with brain development and for developing effective clinical intervention strategies. cellular basis of sevoflurane anesthesia-induced developmental neurotoxicity in studies investigating the mechanisms of sevoflurane-induced immature brain injury, we found that sevoflurane anesthesia may upregulate hippocampal sst expression in macaques, accompanied by alterations in synaptic development-related genes, leading to neurodevelopmental toxicity and long-term cognitive dysfunction [ 4 ]. this finding prompted us to further explore the intrinsic link between sevoflurane neurotoxicity and synaptic development. through immunofluorescence staining experiments, we further observed significant downregulation of hippocampal psd95 and vglut1 following sevoflurane anesthesia, suggesting a reduction in glutamatergic synaptic density [ 22 ]. glutamatergic synapses, the primary synapses of excitatory neurons, serve as fundamental information-processing units in the cns, play critical roles in learning, memory, and emotional regulation, with precise control over their quantity and specificity of connections being essential for maintaining normal cns function [ 23 , 24 ]. previous studies have demonstrated that reduced glutamatergic synaptic density in the hippocampus may contribute to cognitive impairment, while enhancing glutamatergic synapse formation in the mouse hippocampus can mitigate sevoflurane-induced cognitive dysfunction [ 23 , 24 ]. animal studies demonstrate that sevoflurane exposure might upregulate sst expression, potentiating its inhibitory effects on glutamatergic pathways and consequently impairing synaptic plasticity [ 4 , 22 ]. dysregulation of this sst-glutamatergic crosstalk may represent a critical mechanism underlying anesthesia-induced cognitive deficits. these findings suggest that glutamatergic synaptic abnormalities may represent a key mechanism underlying sevoflurane-induced neurotoxicity in the immature nervous system. however, the specific mechanisms by which sevoflurane disrupts glutamatergic synaptic development remain an unresolved question that requires further investigation. moreover, sevoflurane might induce neurotoxicity through various mechanisms. previous study implicates microglial/astrocytic proliferation, elevated proinflammatory cytokine levels, and caspase activation as key contributors to sevoflurane-mediated neurodevelopmental toxicity via inflammatory cascades [ 11 ]. furthermore, sevoflurane potentially elevates systemic estradiol levels, enhancing region-dependent effects on gabaa receptors—increasing excitability in cortical areas while potentiating inhibition in caudal brain regions, synergizing with corticosterone to mediate neurotoxicity [ 12 ]. camp/pka signaling as a potential pathway in sevoflurane-induced synaptic dysfunction the precise structure and function of synapses depend on the coordinated action of multiple molecules and signaling pathways. among these, the cyclic adenosine monophosphate (camp)/protein kinase a (pka) pathway is recognized as a critical factor in maintaining the normal structure and function of excitatory glutamatergic synapses [ 25 ]. camp, a key signaling molecule, activates pka to regulate cellular functions through phosphorylation of target proteins [37]. in the central nervous system, the camp/pka pathway enhances synaptic excitability and plasticity by phosphorylating subunits of ampa receptors, thereby promoting their insertion into the postsynaptic membrane [ 26 ]. previous studies have shown that sevoflurane may impair cognitive function by inhibiting the camp/pka pathway [ 27 ]. during anesthesia, sevoflurane likely reduces intracellular camp levels and suppresses pka activity, leading to decreased phosphorylation of ampa receptors. this directly affects the number and functionality of ampa receptors on the postsynaptic membrane, ultimately resulting in diminished synaptic excitability. our preliminary experiments using western blot analysis found that juvenile mice exposed to sevoflurane represented no significant changes in total glua1 subunit protein levels in the hippocampus, but phosphorylation levels of the glua1 subunit were markedly reduced. these findings suggest that sevoflurane may impair neurodevelopment by disrupting excitatory synaptic function through the camp-pka pathway. to further elucidate this mechanism, we will investigate how sevoflurane modulates the camp-pka pathway and its specific impact on synaptic functional development. sst and its receptors involvement in sevoflurane-induced neurotoxicity sst involvement in sevoflurane-induced synaptic and cognitive deficits current studies on the mechanisms of anesthetic-induced brain developmental effects predominantly rely on rodent models. compared to rodents, non-human primates share up to 98% genetic similarity with humans, offering more accurate modeling of human pathophysiological conditions [ 4 ]. however, due to the high costs and limited availability of non-human primate (nhp) models, their use in investigating anesthetic-induced neurodevelopmental toxicity remains rare internationally [ 4 , 20 , 21 ]. to address this gap, we employed a primate anesthesia model and performed single-nucleus rna sequencing (snrna-seq) on macaque hippocampal tissues. based on snrna-seq results, we observed increased hippocampal sst gene expression following sevoflurane anesthesia [ 4 ]. gene ontology (go) and kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (kegg) analyses revealed that differentially expressed genes in neurons were strongly associated with synaptic transmission, calcium ion transmembrane transport, neurogenesis, and neuronal development [ 4 ]. our preliminary experimental data revealed that young mice exposed to sevoflurane showed a significant increase in hippocampal sst mrna and protein levels ( p &lt; 0.05), accompanied by a marked reduction in vglut1 mrna and protein expression ( p &lt; 0.01), as validated by real-time pcr and western blot analysis. these findings suggest that sevoflurane anesthesia may trigger neurodevelopmental toxicity and long-term cognitive impairment by upregulating sst expression and altering synaptic development-related genes. nevertheless, whether a causal relationship exists between sevoflurane-induced synaptic abnormalities and sst dysregulation, as well as the precise mechanisms involved, requires further exploration. sst, an inhibitory neuropeptide encoded by the sst gene, is widely expressed during embryonic development [ 28 ]. during neural development, sst regulates neuronal migration, differentiation, and synaptic formation/maturation [ 29 ]. functionally, sst serves as a marker for inhibitory interneurons, which synthesize and release this neuropeptide to modulate synaptic density in downstream pyramidal neurons [ 15 ]. excessive sst release from these interneurons can reduce synaptic density and impair cognitive function [ 23 ]. sst and its receptors in the hippocampus, sst primarily acts through five g protein-coupled receptors sstr1–5 [ 28 ]. sstrs are negatively coupled to ac, and sevoflurane-induced activation of sstrs (particularly sstr4) may suppress ac activity, thereby reducing intracellular camp levels [ 30 ]. in the hippocampus, sst has been identified within inhibitory interneurons primarily distributed across specific subregions - the stratum oriens layer of both ca1 and ca3 sectors, as well as the hilar zone of the dentate gyrus [ 18 ]. notably, this neuropeptide demonstrates spatial overlap with gabaergic signaling components [ 31 ]. molecular characterization reveals that four subtypes (sstr1-4) from the sst receptor family show significant expression patterns within hippocampal architecture, with particular abundance observed in principal neuronal populations including pyramidal cells and granule cell layer [ 15 ]. notably, studies have shown that sst and sstr4 agonists impair spatial memory formation in a dose-dependent manner, whereas agonists of sstr1, sstr2, or sstr3 elicit no significant behavioral effects [ 18 ]. this highlights the critical role of sstr4 in synaptic plasticity and cognitive regulation. although sstr4 has been implicated in neurodevelopment, synaptic plasticity, and cognition, its specific role in anesthesia-induced cognitive deficits remains underexplored [ 18 ]. building on the findings above and our earlier hypotheses, we propose the following questions: does sevoflurane impair glutamatergic synaptic function and cognition by modulating sst neurons and downstream sstr4 signaling? is sstr4 a key mediator of sevoflurane-induced neurotoxicity? could targeting sstr4 serve as a therapeutic strategy to mitigate cognitive deficits? addressing these questions will provide critical insights into the mechanisms of anesthetic neurotoxicity and guide the development of targeted interventions. conclusions this comprehensive review synthesizes emerging evidence on sevoflurane-induced developmental neurotoxicity, emphasizing its potential to disrupt critical neurodevelopmental processes and long-term cognitive function. as a widely used pediatric anesthetic, sevoflurane poses paradoxical risks during vulnerable periods of brain maturation, where its neurotoxic effects may manifest through dysregulation of synaptic development, glutamatergic signaling, and inhibitory neuromodulation [ 1 ]. key findings highlight the role of sst and sstr4 in mediating anesthesia-related synaptic dysfunction. experimental data from primate and rodent models demonstrate that sevoflurane exposure upregulates hippocampal sst expression, reduces glutamatergic synaptic markers vglut1 and psd95, and impairs camp/pka signaling—a pathway critical for synaptic plasticity and ampa receptor trafficking [ 4 , 22 ]. these alterations correlate with behavioral deficits in learning and memory, suggesting a mechanistic link between sst-sstr4 signaling dysregulation and anesthesia-induced cognitive decline. however, current evidence is predominantly derived from animal models, and correlating these findings with human brain pathophysiology poses significant constraints due to fundamental interspecies differences, notably in blood-brain barrier properties and distinct neurodevelopmental timelines. future studies should prioritize validating preclinical conclusions through clinical data acquisition, including longitudinal pediatric cohort follow-ups and investigations leveraging neuroimaging and fluid biomarkers. future investigations should prioritize establishing causal relationships between somatostatin signaling and sevoflurane neurotoxicity through sstr knockout models to dissect receptor-specific contributions across developmental stages, coupled with behavioral phenotyping and molecular profiling of apoptosis/neuroinflammation. pharmacological interventions using sstr agonists/antagonists must be systematically evaluated for dose-dependent neuroprotection in preclinical models, assessing histopathological (neuronal loss, synaptic integrity) and functional outcomes. critical mechanistic insights will require deciphering sst-glutamate crosstalk in vulnerable circuits via optogenetics and multi-electrode recordings to map anesthesia-induced excitatory-inhibitory imbalance. preclinical data suggest that targeting sstergic pathways may represent a potential strategy. however, its clinical translatability requires further validation based on current evidence. by integrating molecular, cellular, and behavioral insights, this review advances our understanding of sevoflurane neurotoxicity and provides a framework for mitigating its long-term consequences on cognitive health. further research is needed to elucidate the precise molecular mechanisms by which sstr4 and other sst receptors influence neuronal function and synaptic plasticity in the context of anesthetic exposure. future studies could explore the potential of sstr4 antagonists or agonists as therapeutic interventions for preventing or mitigating the neurotoxic effects of sevoflurane, particularly in vulnerable populations such as neonates and young children. data availability no datasets were generated or analysed during the current study. abbreviations cns: central nervous system sst: somatostatin camp: cyclic
