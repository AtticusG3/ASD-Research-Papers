## Abstract

Selaginellae Herba, known as "Juan Bai" in traditional Chinese medicine, has been used for centuries to alleviate bleeding disorders and promote blood circulation. Its carbonized form, Selaginellae Herba Carbonisata, is specifically employed to enhance hemostatic effects. The fire-based processing (carbonization) is believed to modify its chemical composition and efficacy, yet the transformations and their impact on sensory and bioactive properties remain poorly understood.
This study aimed to comprehensively analyze the chemical changes in Selaginellae Herba during carbonization and correlate them with measurable sensory traits, thereby evaluating whether carbonization preserves or optimizes the herbal properties.
Untargeted metabolomics using UPLC-QE-Orbitrap-MS/MS and Global Natural Products Social Molecular Networking (GNPS) was applied to compare crude (SH-Cr), properly processed (SH-Ca), Insufficiently processed (ISH-Ca), and Excessively processed (ESH-Ca) samples. Multimodal sensory profiling was conducted using electronic eye (color parameters L*/a*/b*), electronic nose (volatiles), and electronic tongue (taste). Multivariate statistical analyses, including OPLS-DA, were used to identify heat-sensitive markers, and Pearson correlation analysis was employed to link compositional changes with sensory attributes.
A total of 83 compounds were unequivocally identified (77 by UPLC-QE-Orbitrap-MS/MS & 6 via GNPS), primarily flavonoids and phenolic acids. Key biflavones such as amentoflavone decreased significantly, while aglycones like apigenin increased, indicating glycoside hydrolysis and biflavone cleavage. OPLS-DA identified 31 potential markers (e.g., glutamic acid, VIP = 1.43). Color parameter b* (yellowness) showed a strong negative correlation with biflavones (e.g., robustaflavone, r = -0.932) and a positive correlation with aglycones (e.g., kaempferol, r = 0.866). Volatile profiles and bitterness were also significantly associated with flavonoid transformations (P < 0.05).
SH-Ca achieved an optimal balance between flavonoid transformation and desirable sensory outcomes, supporting the traditional use of carbonization to enhance the properties of Selaginellae Herba. These findings provide a scientific basis for optimizing processing parameters to ensure quality and efficacy.
