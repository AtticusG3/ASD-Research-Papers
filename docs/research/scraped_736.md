## Abstract

Bisphenol A (BPA), a prevalent environmental pollutant found in plastics and food packaging, has been associated with neurotoxicity and epigenetic dysregulation throughout successive generations. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), a crucial controller of gene expression, are especially susceptible to alterations caused by BPA, which may change transcriptional and post-transcriptional processes. However, the exact mechanism by which lncRNAs interact with BPA remains unclear. Using Drosophila melanogaster and mice as model organisms, this review focuses on BPA driving the dysregulation of lncRNAs and their role in mediating changes in gene expression. This comprehensive review elucidates the potential of natural compounds in mitigating BPA-induced health risks, particularly focusing on neurological development. It also underscores the critical importance of minimizing BPA exposure through the promotion of BPA-free alternatives and reduced plastic consumption as imperative public health strategies.
