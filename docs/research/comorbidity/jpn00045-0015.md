Tourette's Syndrome and Neonatal Anoxia:
Further Evidence of an Organic Etiology

Studies of Tourette's syndrome have indicated that the etiology may be either primary or
secondary. Secondary Tourette's syndrome has been reported in association with numerous neuro-
logical conditions, but there have been no previous reports of Tourette's syndrome and its relation-
ship to neonatal anoxia. This report presents the case ofa 15-year-old boy with a history ofTourette's
syndrome and neonatal anoxia and examines whether or not there is a connection between the two.
To test the hypothesis that this is the first documented case of cerebral anoxia at birth followed by
Tourette's, a review of the pertinent literature on secondary Tourette's syndrome is presented.
Evidence of perinatal anoxia, subsequent Tourette's syndrome, a negative family history, as well as
an examination of the statistical chances of anoxia and Tourette's syndrome co-existing and of all
previous reports ofacquired Tourette's syndrome tend to favor an organic perinatal insult as having
caused the later development of Tourette's syndrome in the case of this adolescent.
Key Words: Tourette's syndrome
In 1885 Georges Gilles de la Tourette first described the
syndrome which bears his name (Gilles de la Tourette 1885).
Since then, studies have indicated that the etiology of
Tourette's syndrome may be either primary or secondary
(Friedhof and Chase 1982). Studies suggest that in over 50%
of children with Tourette's syndrome, the first sign of a
developmental disorder is an attention deficit syndrome,
characterized by difficulties in focusing attention, impulsive-
ness and poor regulation of motor activity (Sacks 1980).
Many patients with Tourette's syndrome are also handi-
capped by specific learning disabilities, in spite of their
generally normal mental capacity (Lucas et al 1967).
Approximately ten percent of patients with Tourette's
syndrome have a family history of the condition. It has been
reported to occur frequently among Ashkenazic Jews, Men-
nonites, and certain Mediterranean groups, but rarely among
blacks (McKusik 1990). Comings (1987) suggested that
Tourette's syndrome is one of the most common genetic
disorders affecting humans, with a frequency of one in 100,
and that the range ofbehavior problems is much broader than
merely motor and verbal tics. His studies implicate a dopa-
mine pathway imbalance resulting in the disinhibition of the
limbic system. Comings' methods and conclusions have been
criticized by others who feel that the incidence is far smaller
(Pauls and Leckman 1986).
Fahn (1982) described a case of "post-traumatic tic
syndrome" and suggested that secondary tic syndromes (i.e.,
tics resulting from structural pathology of the nervous
system) may someday provide pathologic correlations. Such
pathological correlations have yet to be clearly delineated,
even though there have been at least two neuropathological
descriptions of cases of Tourette's syndrome (Dewulf and
vanBogaert 1941).
To our knowledge, this is the first case of documented
cerebral anoxia at birth followed by Tourette's syndrome. To
verify this, a literature search for scientific articles published
between January 1970 and November 1990 was performed
using the Library of Medicine's Elhill System connected to
the Medline files. The search looked for the intersection set
of Tourette's syndrome, perinatal anoxia and childhood
anoxia. It turned up no citations linking these conditions.
In the case presented here, Tourette's syndrome was
preceded by an attention deficit syndrome and learning
disabilities, as is frequently the case. In addition, the
Tourette's syndrome manifested itself with the full range of

complex motor and vocal tics, coprolalia and compulsive
behavior.
Case Report
The patient (F.K.) was the result of a normal, full-term
pregnancy with no noted complications until birth, when
difficulties, including anoxia and icterus, developed. The
pregnancy history revealed that F.K.'s 20-year-old mother
received a pain killer and sleeping medication just prior to
delivery. The onset of labor was spontaneous. The biological
parents had previously had two normal deliveries. Presenta-
tion was cephalic ROA. Labor was five hours and ten minutes
long and was complicated by partial placenta previa. The first
stage of labor was three hours in length, the second stage was
two hours and five minutes, and the third stage, 15 minutes.
F.K. was listless at birth and required resuscitation with
oxygen. His apgar scores were 3/10 at one minute and 5/10
at five minutes, and his birth weight was seven pounds, five
ounces. After delivery, he was kept in the neonatal intensive
care unit for three and one-half weeks, where he was treated
forjaundice but received no transfusions. His mother reports
that he had a collapsed lung and was on a respirator much of
this time.
F.K.'s motor development was delayed. He was able to sit
alone by age one, stand alone by age two and walk at age two
and one-half. He had a single-word vocabulary by age one
but was not able to produce sentences until age three.
The family history revealed that F.K. was the product of
a non-consanguineous union. He has two siblings who are
reportedly in good health. A maternal aunt has a history of
seizures and is receiving phenytoin. No other family history
of tics, learning disabilities, attention deficit disorder (ADD)
or medical disorder was present. F.K.'s parents are white
Protestants, born in the United States.
F.K. has a long history of symptoms compatible with the
DSM-III-R diagnosis of undifferentiated ADD without
hyperactivity. These symptoms include severe distractabil-
ity, short attention span and low frustration tolerance which
pre-dated and did not respond to a therapeutic trial of meth-
ylphenidate. Multiple motor and phonic tics were also present
before the institution of methylphenidate, which did not
exacerbate them. A significant improvement in the ADD
symptoms using the Conner Rating Scales was noted after a
trial of imipramine.
The results of psychological tests conducted when F.K.
was age seven indicated a "pattern consistent with ADD with
impairments in visual-motor skills and visual memory." At
age 11, F.K.'s verbal IQ was 85, his performance IQ was 84
and full-scale IQ was 83 on the Wechsler Intelligence Scale
for Children-Revised with "a great deal of scatter noted in
the test profile, suggesting very uneven functioning and
serious learning problems." Serious deficits were also indi-
cated in the areas of sequential processing, short-term mem-
ory; he had a high degree of distractability and visual-motor
disturbance. F.K. scored below the 5th percentile on all areas
of the Wide Range Achievement Test.
Around age 11, F.K. began exhibiting abnormal vocal
noises such as snorting, throat clearing and sniffling sounds,
nose blowing and grunting. Conversations continued to be
marked with long pauses during which the above noises
and/or coprolalia were produced. In addition to the vocal
sounds, there was also a history of intermittent motor tics,
which included mouthing movements and shoulder shrug-
ging.
At age 11, F.K. began rubbing the back of his head on the
floor, while in an arched supine position, until he achieved
what he described as "a release ofenergy." The head-rubbing
occurred only in the absence offamily members and never in
public. He arched on the ground and used his head and
buttocks as points of contact and then rubbed the back of his
scalp until, if he was uninterrupted, bleeding started. When
F.K. was asked about the head-rubbing, he stated that he got
tremendous energy in his body which needed to be relieved.
He stated that, ifnot relieved, it would get "damned up inside
me until my brain gets jammed."
At age 15, F.K. had a verbal IQ score of 84, performance
IQ score of 78 and a full-scale score IQ of 80. On the
Bender-Gestalt, there were indicators of obvious visual-
motor problems with five Koppitz errors. During this period,
school reports indicated an "unusual tendency to verbalize
taboo words and phrases within the matrix of conversational
speech," indicative of coprolalia.
F.K.'s medical records indicated that on physical exami-
nation at the age of six years and ten months, he measured
423/4 inches (below the 2nd percentile), weighed 42 pounds
(below the 2nd percentile) and had a cranial circumference of
20 inches (24th percentile). The examination showed F.K. to
be right dominant. Deep tendon reflexes were reduced in the
upper extremeties and somewhat increased in the lower ex-
tremeties. He showed an equivical Babinski on the right and
a variable Babinski on the left. He had a remarkably positive
Romberg (eyes closed), falling forward or to the left. Coor-
dination of the upper and lower extremeties were grossly
impaired. The patient's gait was dystaxic, and he walked with
a wide base. He could walk on his toes and on his heels. His
lip and tongue movements were slightly impaired, and his
finger movements were grossly impaired and slow. He had
generalized hypotonia and poor muscular development, but
no diminution of muscle strength. His speech intelligibility
was reduced as a result of dysfluency (motoric).
Routine blood and urine tests were within normal limits.
Further laboratory investigations conducted consisted of a
negative qualitative urine amino acid screen, which ruled out
some types of inborn errors of metabolism. Chromosomal
studies indicated a normal male karyotype, 46, XY, with no
structural abnormalities.
EEG studies at three years of age were within normal
limits. A CT scan performed at age 12 revealed a small
non-displaced fourth ventricle and a prominent cisterna

magna. There was also a mild asymmetrical enlargement of
the lateral ventricles. Overall, the CT scan was read as mildly
abnormal with the possibility of an anatomic abnormality. A
repeat EEG at age 15 was normal.


## Discussion


Any evidence connecting neuropathologic structural
changes and Tourette's syndrome would be helpful in clari-
fying the etiology of this disorder, which is increasingly felt
to be biological in nature.
A great number of adverse events may influence brain
structure, function and development. Anoxia is viewed as the
major factor complicating the effects of trauma at the time of
birth and subsequent cerebral damage is often the result of
the effects ofanoxia rather than the initial trauma (Reitan and
Wolfson 1986).
Placenta previa, respiratory distress and hyperbilirubine-
mia are items on the High-Risk Pregnancy Screening System,
the
highest possible score on which is 10, based on their
value in predicting morbidity and mortality. This lends fur-
ther evidence that there is a strong correlation between these
factors and abnormal development during infancy and child-
hood.
Computed tomography has been hailed as having an un-
paralleled impact on the diagnosis and treatment of patients
who have suffered a head injury. However, CT scanning is
within normal limits in a considerable number ofpersons who
have sustained a significant head injury, and in many cases
the CT scan does not identify extensive small lesions
throughout the brain tissue which are commonly present
(Reitan and Wolfson 1986).
The case presented is that ofa patient with both early brain
damage and Tourette's syndrome. The etiology ofTourette's
syndrome in this case is hypothesized to be secondary to the
anoxia at birth, causing specific neuropathology in CNS areas
responsible for the array of symptoms present. Since all CNS
functions are mediated by neurotransmitters, one might spec-
ulate that damage to specific CNS areas central to certain
neurochemical systems implicated in Tourette's syndrome
would be affected. Although several neurochemical systems
have been implicated in the pathogenesis of Tourette's syn-
drome, the most convincing evidence supports the role of
CNS dopaminergic systems (Riddle et al 1988). Since the
patient's CT scans and EEGs were not grossly abnormal, it
is difficult to speculate on specific anatomic or neurohumoral
changes in this case. We are therefore left with a documented
case of diffuse cerebral damage from birth coinciding with
full-blown Tourette's syndrome.
Tourette's syndrome has been reported in conjunction
with numerous other neurological conditions, some of which
have caused definite structural changes in the CNS. These
include senile (Sutula et al 1981), post-encephalitic (Sacks et
al 1970), tardive (Klawans et al 1978) and post-stroke Touret-
tism (Sacks 1980), as well as tumors, demyelinating disease,
neuro-syphylis and carbon monoxide poisoning (Walse and
Romero 1981). In each of the documented cases, the symp-
toms of Tourette's syndrome appear to be secondary to a
diagnosable neurological disorder which was preceded by
normal neurological functioning; this could not be verified in
F.K.'s case.
We have described the case of an adolescent male with
evidence ofTourette's syndrome. From a review of all avail-
able medical records and historical data, it was found that this
patient also has a documented history of perinatal anoxia.
After a detailed search of the literature, we submit this case
as the first case of cerebral anoxia at birth followed by the
development of Tourette's syndrome.
Although it is statistically feasible that Tourette's syn-
drome and perinatal anoxia can occur at random in the same
individual, we have presented evidence suggesting a causal
rather than a coincidental relationship in this case. This
evidence includes:
1. a negative family history of tics,
Tourette's syndrome, attention deficit disorder, learning dis-
abilities or a behavior disorder; 2. a genetic background not
noted for an unusually high incidence or clustering of
Tourette's symptoms; and 3. clear evidence of CNS damage
occurring at birth manifesting in developmental delays, an
abnormal neurological examination and CT scan abnormali-
ties.
Further neuropathological studies of acquired forms of
Tourette's syndrome will hopefully help establish specific
areas of the central nervous system related to the complex set
of symptoms manifest in this disorder.
