# Delocalised states in a 1D diagonally disordered system

**Authors:** G. G. Kozlov

**Publication Date:** 2003-10-07

**DOI:** 10.48550/arXiv.0310137

## Abstract

1D diagonally disordered chain with Frenkel exciton and long range exponential intersite interaction is considered. It is shown that some states of this disordered system are delocalised contrary to the popular statement that all states in 1D disordered system are localised.
