## Abstract

The physiological functions of micronutrients in neurodevelopment are well documented, but their protective effects on neurodevelopmental disorders remain controversial. We assessed the associations between micronutrients and three main neurodevelopmental disorders, that is, autism spectrum disorder (18,381 cases), attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (38,691 cases), and Tourette's syndrome (4,819 cases), using two-sample Mendelian randomization analyses. In addition, we estimated the mediation role of brain imaging-derived phenotypes (
