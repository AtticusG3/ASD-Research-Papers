## Abstract

Tourette syndrome (TS) and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) often co-occur and are linked to emotional and behavioral difficulties. However, their shared and distinct neural underpinnings, particularly in terms of functional connectivity, remain unclear. Here, we assessed how functional connectivity differs across TS and ADHD as well as its association with emotional and behavioral difficulties. Resting-state electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded from 137 children with TS (n = 51), ADHD (n = 24), or TS + ADHD (n = 29) or from typically developing control subjects (n = 33). Functional connectivity was computed from source-reconstructed EEG data in five frequency bands (delta, theta, alpha, beta, and gamma). Behavioral and emotional problems were assessed with the Child Behavior Checklist. Both TS and ADHD were independently associated with reduced functional connectivity across different brain regions, with no interaction effect. However, externalizing problems showed a TS by ADHD interaction across three frequency bands, such that distinct patterns of functional connectivity were associated with externalizing problems in children with TS + ADHD, relative to those with either TS or ADHD. Although TS and ADHD are associated with decreased functional connectivity in different networks, their effects appear additive rather than interactive at the neural level. However, interactions emerged when examining behavioral problems, suggesting that although TS and ADHD contribute independently to brain connectivity disruptions, their combined impact may uniquely influence emotional and behavioral functioning. This fact highlights the need to consider both shared and disorder-specific mechanisms when studying TS and ADHD.
