## Abstract

Repetitive and restrictive behaviors (RRB) include simple motor stereotypes, tics and complex ritualized and rigid behaviors that are core symptoms in neurodevelopmental disorders such as obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), Tourette syndrome (TS) or autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Sensory phenomena (SP) are uncomfortable feelings, including bodily sensations, sense of inner tension, "just-right" perceptions, feelings of incompleteness, or "urge-only" phenomena, which have been described to precede, trigger, or accompany RRB. In such clinical contexts RRB and SP may be considered common variables that affect multiple aspects of daily functioning and are treatment targets. This study aims to further understand RRB and SP phenomenology in children and adolescents diagnosed with OCD, TS or ASD and identify whether specific RRB or SP can distinguish these groups. We assessed RRB and SP in participants aged between 6 and 17 with a main diagnosis of OCD (n = 23), TS (n = 19), or ASD (n = 21) with the Repetitive Behavior Scale-Revised (RBS-R) and The University of Sao Paulo-Sensory Phenomena Scale (USP-SPS). The RBS-R mean was 17.3 ± 14.9 with no group differences for total RBS-R symptom severity, except for the routine subscale (OCD > ASD, p = 0.03). Ninety percent of participants showed at least one type of SP on the USP-SPS with a mean total severity of 5.3 ± 3.8, with no statistical differences between groups. The most frequent SP subtype was physical sensations (68.4%). RRB and SP are transdiagnostic features in neurodevelopmental disorders and the RBS-R and the USP-SPS might be useful in their assessment and treatment plan.
