# Extracting a Discriminative Structural Sub-Network for ASD Screening using the Evolutionary Algorithm

## Abstract

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is one of the most significant neurological
disorders that disrupt a person's social communication skills. The progression
and development of neuroimaging technologies has made structural network
construction of brain regions possible. In this paper, after finding the
discriminative sub-network using the evolutionary algorithm, the simple
features of the sub-network lead us to diagnose autism in various subjects with
plausible accuracy (76% on average). This method yields substantially better
results compared to previous researches. Thus, this method may be used as an
accurate assistance in autism screening
