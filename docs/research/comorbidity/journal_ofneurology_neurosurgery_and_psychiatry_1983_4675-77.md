SUMMARY
Concordance is reported of Gilles de la Tourette syndrome in a male twin pair in whom
phenotyping revealed a >98-7% probability that they were monozygotic. The development and
extent of the illness differed markedly in the two subjects. Our findings are compatible with the view
that there is a genetic form of Gilles de la Tourette syndrome.
Gilles de la bTourette's syndrome is a condition of
unknown aetiology which is characterised by motor
and vocal tics developing in childhood.1 Coprolalia is
the
most
distinctive
feature
and
occurs
in
approximately
50%
of
subjects.2
Both
environmentally linked and hereditary forms
are
believed
to
occur'
though
some
authors
have
questioned the significance of genetic factors.3 Few
reports
are
available
on

We
report
on
the
concordance of the syndrome in a monozygotic twin
pair in whom the development and progress of the
disorder differed markedly in the two subjects.
Clinical data and methods
The patients were male, of non-Jewish background, who
were reared together. Collateral information was obtained
from
the
parents.
Obstetric
records
were
personally
examined. The mother was
a
full term primagravida.
Pregnancy was unremarkable. The placenta was single and
monochorionic. The twins were identical for the following
blood group antigens:

(table 1). He then developed head-tossing, and, over the
next two years, the tics spread to involve the shoulders
(shrugging), face (grimacing), trunk and limbs (jerking).
At age 9, vocal tics appeared (throat-clearing, grunting,
squealing,
screaming). At
age
12,
coprolalia
("shit",
"fuck", and "bitch") developed. Later, phrases such as
"goddam whore" were verbalised. At school he was a
"straight A" student. His condition progressively worse-
ned and at age 17 a diagnosis of Gilles de la Tourette
syndrome was made. At this time he had coprolalia and
occasional echolalia. Clinically, he displayed most of the
tics on the Initial Symptom List of Shapiro et al,2 as well as
stretching, kicking the ground, tapping the back of his head
and teeth grinding. He had never received psychotropic
medication.
DV was "bluish"
at birth. He was given respiratory
assistance and placed in an incubator for one week. At age 4
years he had a short attention span, high activity level, and
inability to sit still. When 5, he tossed his head. Over the
next year, he made hooting and barking noises and skipped
in
steps
while
walking.
At
age
6
a
diagnosis
of
"hyperactivity" was made and methylphenidate started. At
low doses (1 tablet twice daily, exact dose unknown), his
activity level and concentration improved. Within weeks,
the tics worsened. By age 7, his movements and vocalisa-
tions became even more marked, with severe head tossing,
shoulder shrugging, hooting and barking. Methylphenidate
was gradually increased. At age 8, his head tossing and body
contortions were described as "violent", at which time the
patient was taking methylphenidate in amounts four to five
times greater than the initial dose. At age 12-13, while still
on methylphenidate he appeared to have "outgrown his
condition". Accordingly, methylphenidate was phased out.
The tics continued to abate, so that by age 16 they manifested
only when he was exceptionally stressed or tired. Under
these conditions he would nod and tug his hair. This situa-
tion persisted to the present time. When examined by us, no
tics were observed. DV never showed coprolalia. Aside
from
methylphenidate,
he
received
no
psychotropic
medication.
Apart from tics (CV), clinical examination was normal in

## Discussion


Genetic factors are believed to play a role in Gilles de
la Tourette syndrome.1Evidenceforthisview, derived
from familial aggregation studies has, however, been
questioned.3 Few reports are available on Gilles de la
Tourette syndrome in twins (table 2). Unfortunately,
establishment of zygosity by rigorous criteria in these
twin studies is wanting. In our patients there was
76
Wasertnan, Lal, Gauthier
Gilles de la Tourette's syndrome in monozygotic twins
>98 7% probability that they were monozygotic.
In CV the age of onset, the presence of vocal tics,
motor tics, and coprolalia together with the absence
of other physical symptoms, laboratory abnormalities
or history of drug exposure make the diagnosis of
Gilles de la Tourette syndrome fairly certain. DV was
initially diagnosed as "hyperactive". Further, treat-
ment of hyperactive
behavioural
disorders with
methylphenidate may induce Gilles de la Tourette
syndrome.8-'0 Hence the concordance of diagnosis in
our twin pair may be questioned. However, signs and
symptoms of the hyperactive syndrome (minimal
brain dysfunction) are not uncommonly found in
Gilles de la Tourette syndrome patients.2
I
Also,
vocal tics which are characteristic of Gilles de la
Tourette syndrome are not a feature of minimal brain
dysfunction. Though DV has never exhibited copro-
lalia, this symptom only occurs in 50% of Gilles de la
Tourette syndrome patients.' The motor and vocal
tics antedated drug therapy so that DV's condition
cannot
be
considered
a
consequence
of
methylphenidate therapy. Our diagnosis of DV is
Gilles de la Tourette syndrome.
Our observations support the view of Eldridge et
all that there is a genetic form of Gilles de la Tourette
syndrome. Even though our twin pair was concordant
for
the
syndrome,
the
onset and development
differed significantly in the two subjects. Similar
variation in outcome in a monozygotic twin pair who
were
identical
serologically
(but
dissimilar
in
appearance) has been noted by Shapiro et al.2 In our
twin pair the twins were similar in appearance but the
older twin, the one with the active Gilles de la
Tourette syndrome, was 11/2 inches taller.
An enhancement of central catecholaminergic
mechanisms
is
believed
to
underlie
the
patho-
physiology of Gilles de
la Tourette syndrome."'
Methylphenidate increases the availability of neuro-
transmitter
at
postsynaptic
catecholaminergic
receptor sites and in this manner is believed to account
for the precipitation'0 or worsening of established
Gilles de la Tourette syndrome.8
2 In keeping with
the foregoing observations, methylphenidate also
worsened the tic behaviour in DV, at least for the first
several years. The subsequent abatement of Gilles de
la Tourette syndrome
in DV despite continued
administration of methylphenidate may have been an
idiosyncratic and independent event unrelated to
methylphenidate.
On
the
other
hand
we
can
speculate that the improvement that ensued with con-
77
tinuous
methylphenidate
therapy
resulted
from
progressive desensitisation of catecholamine receptor
sites in the presence of chronic neurotransmitter
excess.'3
