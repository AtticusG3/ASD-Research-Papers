# Bayesian estimation of clustered dependence structures in functional neuroconnectivity

## Abstract

Motivated by the need to model the dependence between regions of interest in functional neuroconnectivity for efficient inference, we propose a new sampling-based Bayesian clustering approach for covariance structures of high-dimensional Gaussian outcomes. The key technique is based on a Dirichlet process that clusters covariance sub-matrices into independent groups of outcomes, thereby naturally inducing sparsity in the whole brain connectivity matrix. A new split-merge algorithm is employed to achieve convergence of the Markov chain that is shown empirically to recover both uniform and Dirichlet partitions with high accuracy. We investigate the empirical performance of the proposed method through extensive simulations. Finally, the proposed approach is used to group regions of interest into functionally independent groups in the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange participants with autism spectrum disorder and and co-occurring attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.
