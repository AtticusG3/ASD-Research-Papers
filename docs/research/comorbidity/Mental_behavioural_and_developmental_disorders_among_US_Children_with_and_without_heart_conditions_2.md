## Abstract

Children with heart conditions, particularly CHDs, may experience adverse neurodevelopmental and psychosocial outcomes. Our study aimed to: (1) compare national prevalence of mental, behavioural, and developmental disorders among children by heart condition status and (2) identify associated characteristics among children with heart conditions. Nationally representative data from the National Survey of Children's Health (2016-2021) on U.S. children aged 6-17 years without Down syndrome were analysed. Caregivers reported whether a healthcare provider told them their child has ever had a heart condition or currently has depression, anxiety, ADHD, behavioural, or conduct problems, Tourette syndrome, autism spectrum disorder, developmental delay, intellectual disability, learning disability, or a speech or other language disorder. Logistic regression analysis compared disorder prevalence by heart condition status and, among children with heart conditions, assessed whether disorders were associated with demographic and contextual characteristics. Among 3,440 children with heart conditions, 42% had an examined disorder, compared to 23% of 133,280 children without heart conditions (adjusted prevalence ratio = 1.8; 95% confidence interval: 1.7, 2.0). Each disorder was more prevalent among children with versus without heart conditions (adjusted prevalence ratio range: 1.9 to 5.1), with anxiety (22.1%), ADHD (20.4%), and learning disabilities (19.6%) most common. Among children with heart conditions, disorders were consistently associated with an increased number of adverse childhood experiences. These findings support clinical guidelines recommending neurodevelopmental and mental health screening and interventions for children with heart conditions and can be used as a national baseline to gauge progress of guideline implementation.
