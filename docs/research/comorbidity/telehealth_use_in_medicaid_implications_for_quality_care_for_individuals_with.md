## Abstract

The expansion of telehealth during the COVID-19 pandemic transformed behavioral health care delivery, including for individuals with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and Tourette syndrome (TS), conditions that require ongoing treatment and monitoring. We explored the implications of telehealth on the quality of care for Medicaid beneficiaries with ADHD and TS, highlighting the benefits, challenges, and policy considerations. Telehealth has increased access to behavioral health services, including for ADHD and TS, by reducing geographic and financial barriers to care. The expanded use of telehealth has allowed patients to more easily interact with health care providers, and it particularly benefits those with limited access to specialized care. However, challenges remain, such as concerns about stimulant misuse in online ADHD treatments and the limited privacy offered in home telehealth settings. Furthermore, disparities in broadband access may exacerbate existing inequalities in care. Despite telehealth's potential to increase access to specialized care, the quality of telehealth provided is not guaranteed. Current quality measures for Medicaid telehealth services, especially for ADHD and TS, are insufficient. While some Medicaid programs have integrated telehealth into quality reporting, a need exists for more tailored measures that assess the unique needs of people with ADHD and TS. We recommend the development of quality measures for ADHD and TS, performance improvement projects for these conditions, better alignment of Medicaid managed care oversight, and research into the long-term outcomes of telehealth for care of people with ADHD and TS. Such efforts would support continued Medicaid telehealth expansion while ensuring high-quality care.
