## Abstract

Children with congenital heart disease (CHD) remain at risk for neurodevelopmental impairment despite improved peri- and intraoperative care. Our prospective cohort study aimed to determine the relationship between perioperative brain volumes and neurodevelopmental outcome in neonates with severe CHD. Pre- and postoperative cerebral MRI was acquired in term born neonates with CHD undergoing neonatal cardiopulmonary bypass surgery. Brain volumes were measured using an atlas prior based automated method. One-year outcome was assessed with the Bayley-III. CHD infants (n=77) had lower pre- and postoper-ative total and regional brain volumes compared to controls (n=44, all p<0.01). CHD infants had poorer cognitive and motor outcome (p<=0.0001) and a trend towards lower language composite score compared to controls (p=0.06). The total and selected regional postoperative brain volumes predicted cognitive and language outcome (all p<0.04). This association was independent of length of intensive care unit stay for total, cortical, temporal, frontal and cerebellar volumes. In CHD neonates undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass surgery, pre- and postoperative brain volumes are reduced, and postoperative brain volumes predict cognitive and language outcome at one year. Reduced cerebral volumes in CHD patients could serve as a biomarker for im-paired outcome.
