## Abstract

The PHTS Consensus Guidelines Working Group was established, comprising a core group of seven experts in the diagnosis and management of PHTS, including genetics, neurology, neuropsychology, and neurodevelopment (including psychiatry and psychology). The Working Group held joint meetings with a Patient Advisory Group (PTEN Foundation), comprising patients with PHTS and their advocates. Informed by a comprehensive literature review, the Working Group met regularly between 2022 and 2024 to produce guideline statements, refined through iterative feedback. A modified Delphi approach was used with an independent extended panel of neurologists, neuropsychologists, and psychiatrists, to establish final consensus guidelines. The first iteration of the clinical consensus recommendations for the management of ND and neurologic features in patients with PHTS was formed. Guidelines encompass ND challenges, mood disorders, ND screening, neuroimaging abnormalities, neurologic comorbidities, and tumors affecting the CNS. While multiple efforts are ongoing to better characterize the natural history of PHTS, the clinical management of individuals with PHTS is complex and remains challenging because of variable expressivity and age-related specificities. As part of a comprehensive effort to develop consensus management guidelines, which cover all manifestations of PHTS, we present the first iteration of guidelines for the ND and neurologic manifestations of PHTS, aimed at improving care for affected individuals and families.
