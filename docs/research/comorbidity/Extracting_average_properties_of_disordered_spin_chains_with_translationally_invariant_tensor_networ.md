# Extracting average properties of disordered spin chains with translationally invariant tensor networks

## Abstract

We develop a tensor network-based method for calculating disorder-averaged expectation values in random spin chains without having to explicitly sample over disorder configurations. The algorithm exploits statistical translation invariance and works directly in the thermodynamic limit. We benchmark our method on the infinite-randomness critical point of the random transverse field Ising model.
