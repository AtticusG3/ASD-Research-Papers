## Abstract

To evaluate the performance of quantum computing systems relative to classical counterparts and explore the potential for quantum advantage, we propose a game-solving benchmark based on Elo ratings in the game of tic-tac-toe. We compare classical convolutional neural networks (CNNs), quantum convolutional neural networks (QCNNs), and hybrid classical-quantum models by assessing their performance against a random-move agent in automated matches. Additionally, we implement a QCNN integrated with quantum communication and evaluate its performance to quantify the overhead introduced by noisy quantum channels. Our results show that the classical-quantum hybrid model achieves Elo ratings comparable to those of classical CNNs, while the standalone QCNN underperforms under current hardware constraints. The communication overhead was found to be modest. These findings demonstrate the viability of using game-based benchmarks for evaluating quantum computing systems and suggest that quantum communication can be incorporated with limited impact on performance, providing a foundation for future hybrid quantum applications.
