## Abstract

We present a machine learning approach that allows to characterize the disorder potential of a two-dimensional electronic system from its quantum transport properties. Numerically simulated transport data for a large number of disorder configurations is used for the training of artificial neural networks. We show that the trained networks are able to recognize details of the disorder potential of an unknown sample from its transport properties, and that they can even reconstruct the complete potential landscape seen by the electrons.
