# Fetal neurology: evolving roles for pediatricians and neurologists in prenatal and postnatal care.

## Abstract

Fetal neurology is a distinct subspecialty within pediatric neurology, and a core element of neonatal neurocritical care. Increased fidelity and availability of fetal imaging and increasing yields of advanced genetic testing help the fetal neurologist provide an assessment of potential neurodevelopmental outcomes when a suspected or confirmed fetal brain malformation is present. The postnatal care of infants with a previously diagnosed brain abnormality may include pediatricians in a general primary care setting. It is imperative that pediatricians have a basic understanding of common fetal neurologic conditions and comorbidities to provide the best care to new families facing these challenges. Growing literature of fetal brain abnormalities has allowed for increasing prenatal neurologic diagnoses. The recent recognition of neonatal neurocritical care as a distinct subspecialty seeks to optimize the management and care of this patient population. This review provides a broad overview of the evolution of fetal neurology as a distinct field within neurology and neonatal neurocritical care. This article highlights nuances of fetal consultations and reviews some of the more common fetal neurologic diagnoses and comorbidities. Finally, it provides a call to action for collaborative management in pediatric care.
