## Abstract

Several studies have reported associations between attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and substance use disorders (SUD). However, sex-differences in ADHD and SUD, especially when associated with other psychiatric comorbidities, are less studied. To compare the prevalence of SUD among individuals with and without ADHD to describe groups, defined by sex and psychiatric comorbidity, who may benefit from targeted follow-up. Data from the Medical Birth Registry of Norway, the Norwegian Prescription Database and the Norwegian Patient Registry were linked. Individuals born 1988-2001 were identified and followed until 2019 (ages 18-31 years in 2019). Log binomial regression was used to calculate age-adjusted prevalence differences (PD) of SUD with 95% confidence intervals in males (N = 31,146) and females (N = 18,669) with ADHD, overall and with/without other psychiatric comorbidities, relative to those without ADHD (males N = 381,568; females N = 368,804). ADHD was associated with SUD across all substances among both males and females ("Any SUD": PD The high prevalence of SUD associated with ADHD, with higher PDs in males than females for most specific SUDs, indicates a need for targeted prevention. The substantially higher prevalence of SUD in individuals with ADHD and comorbid psychiatric disorders emphasizes the need for close follow-up of individuals with ADHD both regarding SUD and other psychiatric disorders. Further studies are needed to evaluate potential causal relations between ADHD, other psychiatric comorbidities, and SUD, and to understand the sex-differences in SUD prevalence across psychiatric comorbidities in ADHD.
