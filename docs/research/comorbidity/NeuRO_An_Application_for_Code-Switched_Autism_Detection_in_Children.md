# NeuRO: An Application for Code-Switched Autism Detection in Children

**Authors:** Mohd Mujtaba Akhtar, Girish, Orchid Chetia Phukan, Muskaan Singh

## Abstract

Code-switching is a common communication phenomenon where individuals alternate between two or more languages or linguistic styles within a single conversation. Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a developmental disorder posing challenges in social interaction, communication, and repetitive behaviors. Detecting ASD in individuals with code-switch scenario presents unique challenges. In this paper, we address this problem by building an application NeuRO which aims to detect potential signs of autism in code-switched conversations, facilitating early intervention and support for individuals with ASD.
