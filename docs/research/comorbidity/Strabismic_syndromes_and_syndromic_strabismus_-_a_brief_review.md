# Strabismic syndromes and syndromic strabismus - a brief review

**Authors:** Aditya Tri Hernowo, R. Haryo Yudono

## Abstract

Strabismus can be found in association with congenital heart diseases, for examples, in velocardiofacial (DiGeorge) syndrome, Down syndrome, mild dysmorphic features, in CHARGE association, Turner syndrome, Ullrich-Turner syndrome, cardiofaciocutaneous syndrome.1-4 Some types of strabismus is heritable (e.g. infantile esotropia syndrome), particularly the ones associated with multisystem disorders, e.g. Moebius syndrome, Prader-Willi syndrome, craniofacial dysostoses, and mitochondrial myopathies.5 Due to the complexities that a case of strabismus may pertain to, it is worthwhile to get to know more about the strabismic syndromes and syndromic strabismus. This brief review -as its name implied- does not attempt to cover every angle of the syndromic conditions, but offers a refreshment on our knowledge about more prevalent strabismus-related syndromes.
