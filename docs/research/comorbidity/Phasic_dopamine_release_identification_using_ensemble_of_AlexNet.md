# Phasic dopamine release identification using ensemble of AlexNet

## Abstract

Dopamine (DA) is an organic chemical that influences several parts of behaviour and physical functions. Fast-scan cyclic voltammetry (FSCV) is a technique used for in vivo phasic dopamine release measurements. The analysis of such measurements, though, requires notable effort. In this paper, we present the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for the identification of phasic dopamine releases.
