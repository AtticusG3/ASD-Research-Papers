# Ternary Syndrome Decoding with Large Weight

**Authors:** Rémi Bricout, André Chailloux, Thomas Debris-Alazard, Matthieu Lequesne

**Publication Date:** 2019-03-18

**DOI:** 10.48550/arXiv.1903.07464

## Abstract

The Syndrome Decoding problem is at the core of many code-based cryptosystems. In this paper, we study ternary Syndrome Decoding in large weight. This problem has been introduced in the Wave signature scheme but has never been thoroughly studied. We perform an algorithmic study of this problem which results in an update of the Wave parameters. On a more fundamental level, we show that ternary Syndrome Decoding with large weight is a really harder problem than the binary Syndrome Decoding problem, which could have several applications for the design of code-based cryptosystems.
