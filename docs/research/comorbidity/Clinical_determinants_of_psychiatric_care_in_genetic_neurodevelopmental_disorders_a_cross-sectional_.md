## Abstract

This study aims to identify clinical and developmental factors associated with psychotropic medication exposure and subspecialty psychiatric service utilization among patients with genetic neurodevelopmental disorders (GNDDs). We conducted a retrospective analysis of 316 patients from the Care and Research in Neurogenetics (CARING) Clinic at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). We assessed the association between neurodevelopmental and psychiatric diagnoses, behavioral histories, family history, and service utilization with two outcomes: (1) the number of psychotropic medication classes trialed before clinic intake and (2) whether the patient was evaluated by a CARING psychiatrist. Poisson and logistic regression models were used to evaluate associations while adjusting for demographic and clinical covariates. Individuals with more severe behavioral disturbances had higher psychiatric service needs, while intellectual disability was associated with greater psychotropic medication exposure but not increased psychiatric consultation, possibly due to prior community-based care. The presence of a pathogenic/likely pathogenic genetic variant was not associated with either outcome, suggesting that genetic diagnosis alone does not predict psychiatric needs. Instead, behavioral comorbidities, not genetic status, were the primary drivers of psychotropic use and psychiatric referrals. A history of developmental delay was negatively associated with psychiatric consultation, and mediation analyses indicated that early intervention services partly explained this relationship. Additionally, patients receiving behavioral therapies had higher psychotropic exposure, reflecting greater clinical complexity and frequent use of multimodal treatment strategies. Our findings suggest that psychiatric needs in GNDDs are more closely tied to behavioral comorbidities than to genetic diagnosis status, reinforcing the importance of symptom-driven psychiatric evaluation. The observed relationship between early developmental interventions and psychiatric service utilization warrants further longitudinal investigation. These results highlight opportunities to optimize psychiatric care pathways through early screening, integrated behavioral and pharmacologic interventions, and targeted resource allocation for individuals with neurodevelopmental disorders.
