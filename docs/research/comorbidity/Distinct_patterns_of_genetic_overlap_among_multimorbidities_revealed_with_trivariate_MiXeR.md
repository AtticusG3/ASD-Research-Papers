## Abstract

Multimorbidities are a global health challenge. Accumulating evidence indicates that overlapping genetic architectures underlie comorbid complex human traits and disorders. This can be quantified for a pair of phenotypes using various techniques. Still, the pattern of genetic overlap between three distinct complex phenotypes, which is important for understanding multimorbidities, has not been possible to quantify. Here, we present and validate the novel trivariate MiXeR tool, which disentangles the pattern of genetic overlap between three complex phenotypes using summary statistics from genome-wide association studies. Our simulations show that trivariate MiXeR can reliably reconstruct different patterns of genetic overlap and estimate the proportions of genetic overlap between three phenotypes. We found substantial genetic overlap between gastro-intestinal and brain diseases supporting a genetic basis of the gut-brain axis-the pattern consistent with pairwise analysis. However, the pattern of genetic overlap between three diverse cardiometabolic and renal health indicators and three immune-linked disorders revealed a much larger genomic component shared between all phenotypes than expected from separate pairwise analyses. This suggests the existence of core pathways underlying distinct but related chronic conditions. Overall, trivariate MiXeR offers a novel and efficient tool for investigating patterns of genetic overlap among three complex phenotypes. This contributes to a better understanding of genetic relationships between complex traits and disorders, potentially providing new insights into the mechanisms underlying common multimorbidities.
