Short report
A case of Gilles de la Tourette's syndrome with
midbrain involvement
JPWF LAKKE, JT WILMINK
From the Department ofNeurology, University Hospital, Groningen, The Netherlands
SUMMARY
In a 27-year-old patient with Gilles de la Tourette's syndrome a pineal tumour had
been found 10 years previously and was apparently a coincidental finding. Minute calcifications
were later detected around the third ventricle and the mesencephalic periaqueductal gray matter
by high resolution computed tomography.
It is argued that this observation may support
Devinsky's speculations that midbrain involvement has pathological significance for the Gilles de
la Tourette syndrome.
For many years tic conditions, including Gilles de la
Tourette syndrome were attributed to psychogenic
factors. The first successful treatment of a patient
with Gilles de la Tourette syndrome with haldol' in
the 1960s shifted attention to a neurobiochemical
basis. The ability of haldol and other dopamine
blocking
medication
to
suppress
tic
symptoms
implied abnormalities in the dopaminergic synaptic
transmission system, possibly at the site of the basal
ganglia. Only a few necropsy reports have appeared
in the literature2 and no evidence has been found as
yet for a pathological-anatomical correlate of Gilles
de la Tourette syndrome. Recently Devinsky3 specu-
lated that damage to the penaqueductal gray matter
and midbrain tegmentum may be involved in Gilles
de la Tourette syndrome. His reasoning was based
on three observations: (1) pharmacological manipu-
lation of the biogenic metabolism, (2) a review of
symptoms and localisation of lesion in encephalitis
lethargica and (3) animal studies on the anatomy of
vocalisation. We present a patient with Gilles de la
Tourette syndrome in whom radiological evidence
was found of midbrain involvement, which may sup-
port Devinsky s hypothesis.

Case report
A 20-year-old man first attended at the age of sixteen. For
the preceding three years he had been considered a hyper-
kinetic child, but his condition had worsened. He suffered
frequent unexpected sudden contractions of his truncal
musculature causing hyperextension of his body, back-
wards throwing of the head and a forward jerk of his pelvis.
This was followed by a rapid displacement of the left leg
and an outward flinging of the left arm. The short periods
of instability did not cause him to fall. This complex motor
tic could occur at irregulal intervals, unpredictably during
activity such as walking, as well as while sitting or in the
supine position. In addition explosive utterances were
noted, both during the motor tic as well in the interval
period. Originally an
inarticulate noise,
the vocal
tic
changed early in the course of the disease to a stereotype
obscenity. Both motor and vocal tics increased during
stress situations and disappeared during sleep. Previous
history and family history were unremarkable. There were
no indications of premature sexual maturation.
Neurological examination was normal with the excep-
tion of the tics. Routine laboratory studies, EEG, skull
radiographs and echography demonstrated
no abnor-
malities.
Routine CSF
examination
was
normal,
no
abnormal cells were found. HVA and 5-HIAA concentra-
tions in CSF with probenecid were elevated; HVA 140
mg/ml and 5 HIAA 49 mg/ml (probenecid 9 0 ,ug/ml)
respectively. Treatment with haldol decreased the motor
and vocal tics in the beginning of therapy but two years
later the truncal jerking movements became more and
more violent and a stereotactic intervention was decided
upon. However, the pre-operative pneumencephalogram
(fig A) showed obliteration of the pineal recess by an
expanding mass with an anteroposterior diameter of some
2 cm (with no correction for radiological enlargement),
1293

which protruded into the quadrigeminal plate cistern and
appeared to displace the suprapineal recess upward, while
leaving the aqueduct patent. The mass contained fine
granular calcification in two separate locations and was
diagnosed as most probably a pinealoma.
Stereotactic therapy was not carried out and the tumour
was treated with radiation (4 x 725 Rad). Haldol medica-
tion was increased to 20 mg daily with useful effect. By the
end of 1974 the patient started to complain of diplopia and
some months later the right m. rectus externus became
paretic and the left rectus internus muscle showed some
weakness. Upon downwards gaze nystagmus was seen and
retraction
of
the
right
sided
eyelid
(Collier's
sign).
Pneumencephalographic examination was repeated, and
showed that the size of the pineal mass had not increased.
The abnormalities of ocular motility have not increased
since. In the course of therapy remissions and exacerba-
tions occurred in the severity of the tics, but in general the
motor and vocal abnormalities declined. For control pur-
poses CT was recently performed (fig B). This showed the
partially calcified mass in the pineal region. Minute areas
of calcification were also seen bilaterally in the adjoining
posterior portion of the third ventricular wall, extending
forward and laterally into the thalamus. At a lower level
similar discrete calcium deposits could be seen in the brain
stem at the mesencephalic level, probably located in and
between the periaqueductal gray matter and the nucleus
ruber.


## Discussion


Devinsky proposed that the periaqueductal gray
matter and midbrain tegmentum may be involved in
Gilles de la Tourette syndrome, but recognised that
the role of the midbrain in the pathophysiological
mechanism
of
Gilles
de
la
Tourette
syndrome
remains speculative. His eloquent reasoning is based
upon (a) the correspondence of Gilles de la Tourette
syndrome symptomatology with motor and vocal
tics
and
obsessive-compulsive
behaviour
in
encephalitis lethargica.
In the
latter disease the
periaquaductal gray matter and midbrain tegmen-
tum are the main sites of involvement as well as
substantia migra and structures around the third
ventricle. Biochemically DA, NA and 5-HT trans-
mission are affected. (b) Midbrain stimulation in
monkey, cat and birds produced a wide range of
affective species-specific vocalisations, comparable
with the vocal tics of Gilles de la Tourette syndrome,
the latter having emotional characteristics, (c) hal-
dol and, recently, clonidine, reducing dopaminergic
and noradrenergic activity, are therapeutically effec-
tive in Gilles de la Tourette syndrome. Nuclei with
these
monoaminergic
cells
are
located
in
the
mesencephalic area.
Our findings
of scattered
calcification
at the
mesencephalic level seem to confirm Devinsky' s
hypothesis. However, the nature of this calcification
is obscure and may be related to the pineal tumour.

Though originally diagnosed as a pinealoma, with
hindsight differential diagnostic considerations may
further delineate the nature of tumour. Neoplastic
metastases are unlikely in view of the elapsed time.
The presence of calcification within the mass is com-
patible with the diagnosis of teratoma, although
these
tumours
calcify
less
frequently
than
pinealomas. Gliomas of the posterior third ventricle
rarely exhibit calcification.4 Pineal growths are his-
tologically divided in non-parenchymal (that is germ
cell tumours) and parenchymal tumours (that is true

pinealomas).5 In the former group most cases of
sexual
precocity
occur.
In
the
latter group
of
pinealoma,
pineoblastomas
are
malignant,
pineocytomas much
less.
In contradistinction
to
germinomas, the pinealoma in particular has promi-
nent calcification within the pineal mass, as has
become particularly evident since computed tomog-
raphy.6 These pineocytomas can be treated effec-
tively with radiation without much chance of recurr-
ence. We assume that our patient has a pineocytoma
and radiation therapy apparently has halted tumour
growth. The calcification is not the result of radia-
tion therapy, because it was present before com-
mencement of therapy. However, the presence of
the tumour sets our case apart from classical cases of
Gilles de la Tourette syndrome, although a coinci-
dent observation is not excluded. If there is any rela-
tion between tumour, calcification and Gilles de la
Tourette syndrome, then one may assume this to be
a case of symptomatic Gilles de la Tourette syn-
drome and as such confirms the hypothesis of
Devinsky. On the other hand, if a tumour in the
1296
pineal region is an accidental finding and our patient
suffers from pure Gilles de la Tourette syndrome,
the discrete calcium deposits around the posterior
portion of the third ventricular wall and the brain
stem at the mesencephalic level may be of aetiologi-
cal significance. The likelihood of the latter assump-
tion seems to be further confirmed by the fact that in
larger series of pineal growth,56 with the exception
of one case of dystonia, no abnormal movement dis-
orders were reported. Further CT investigations in
other cases of Gilles de la Tourette syndrome may
clarify this intriguing problem.
