## Abstract

Progress in real-time, simultaneous in vivo detection of multiple
neurotransmitters will help accelerate advances in neuroscience research. The
need for development of probes capable of stable electrochemical detection of
rapid neurotransmitter fluctuations with high sensitivity and selectivity and
sub-second temporal resolution has, therefore, become compelling. Additionally,
a higher spatial resolution multi-channel capability is required to capture the
complex neurotransmission dynamics across different brain regions. These
research needs have inspired the introduction of glassy carbon (GC)
microelectrode arrays on flexible polymer substrates through carbon MEMS
(C-MEMS) microfabrication process followed by a novel pattern transfer
technique. These implantable GC microelectrodes offer unique advantages in
electrochemical detection of electroactive neurotransmitters through the
presence of active carboxyl, carbonyl, and hydroxyl functional groups. In
addition, they offer fast electron transfer kinetics, capacitive
electrochemical behavior, and wide electrochemical window. Here, we combine the
use of these GC microelectrodes with the fast scan cyclic voltammetry (FSCV)
technique to optimize the co-detection of dopamine and serotonin in vitro and
in vivo. We demonstrate that using optimized FSCV triangular waveform at scan
rates lower than 700 V/s and holding and switching at potentials of 0.4 and 1V
respectively, it is possible to discriminate voltage reduction and oxidation
peaks of serotonin and dopamine, with serotonin contributing distinct multiple
oxidation peaks. Taken together, our results present a compelling case for a
carbon-based MEA platform rich with active functional groups that allows for
repeatable and stable detection of electroactive multiple neurotransmitters at
concentrations as low as 10 nM
