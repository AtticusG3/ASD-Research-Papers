## Abstract

Stressful events during pregnancy impact on the progeny neurodevelopment. However, little is known about preconceptional stress effects. The rat social isolation represents an animal model of chronic stress inducing a variety of dysfunctions. Moreover, social deprivation during adolescence interferes with key neurodevelopmental processes. Here, we investigated the development of behavioural, neurochemical and redox alterations in the male offspring of socially isolated female rats before pregnancy, reared in group (GRP) or in social isolation (ISO) from weaning until young-adulthood. To this aim, females were reared in GRP or in ISO conditions, from PND21 to PND70, when they were mated. Their male offspring was housed in GRP or ISO conditions through adolescence and until PND70, when passive avoidance-PA, novel object recognition-NOR and open field-OF tests were performed. Levels of noradrenaline (NA), serotonin (5-HT), 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA), glutamate (GLU) and GABA were assessed in the prefrontal cortex (PFC). Moreover, cortical ROS levels were quantified, as well as NF-kB and the NADPH oxidase NOX2 expression, redox status (expressed as GSH:GSSG ratio) and SOD1 amount. A significant decrease of the latency time in the PA was observed in the offspring of ISO females. In the NOR test, while a significant increase in the exploratory activity towards the novel object was observed in the offspring of GRP females, no significant differences were found in the offspring of ISO females. No significant differences were found in the OF test among experimental groups. Theoffspring of ISO females showed increased NA and 5-HIAA levels, whereas in the offspring persistently housed in isolation condition from weaninguntil adulthood, we detected reduced 5-HT levels and ehnanced 5-HIAA amount. No significant changes in GLU concentrations were detected, while decreased GABA content was observed in the offspring of ISO females exposed to social isolation. Increased ROS levels as well as reduced NF-κB, NOX2 expression were detected in the offspring of ISO females. This was accompanied by reduced redox status and enhanced SOD1 levels. In conclusion, our results suggest that female exposure to chronic social stress before pregnancy might have a profound influence on the offspring neurodevelopment in terms of cognitive, neurochemical and redox-related alterations, identifying this specific time window for possible preventive and therapeutic strategies.
