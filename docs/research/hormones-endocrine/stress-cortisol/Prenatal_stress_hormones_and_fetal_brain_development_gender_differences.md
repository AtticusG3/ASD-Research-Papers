## Abstract

Prenatal stress is increasingly recognized as a critical factor influencing fetal brain development, with potential long-term risks for neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders. This review explores the effects of prenatal stress on the fetal brain, with particular emphasis on sex differences and the interplay between genetic, epigenetic, and environmental factors. The activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis in response to maternal stress leads to increased levels of glucocorticoids, which can cross the placenta and alter fetal brain structure and function. Key regions affected include the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, and amygdala, which are crucial for emotional regulation, memory, and cognitive function. Sex differences play a significant role in fetal stress responses, with males exhibiting greater vulnerability to adverse prenatal conditions. Studies suggest that male fetuses exposed to high maternal cortisol levels exhibit alterations in brain connectivity, increased amygdala volume, and heightened stress reactivity, whereas female fetuses may show adaptive mechanisms that confer resilience. Additionally, maternal nutritional status influences fetal neurodevelopment, with both undernutrition and obesity contributing to structural and functional changes in the fetal brain. Advances in neuroimaging techniques, including high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and placental diffusion imaging have provided valuable insights into how prenatal stress affects fetal brain connectivity. Epigenetic modifications, such as DNA methylation and histone modification, are implicated in the long-term programming of stress responses. Furthermore, early-life interventions, including maternal social support and mindfulness-based therapies, may mitigate the adverse effects of prenatal stress on offspring neurodevelopment. Given the profound impact of prenatal stress on fetal brain development, early identification of at-risk populations and the implementation of targeted interventions are crucial. Future research should integrate findings from neuroscience, genetics, and endocrinology to develop preventive strategies that improve neurodevelopmental outcomes and reduce the burden of stress-related disorders in later life.
