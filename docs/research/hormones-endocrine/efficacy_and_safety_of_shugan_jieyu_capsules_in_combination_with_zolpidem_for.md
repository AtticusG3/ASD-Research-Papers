## Abstract

Insomnia disorder with depressive symptoms (IDDS) represents a significant clinical phenotype, with a bidirectional relationship where insomnia both contributes to and results from depression. This study aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of combining zolpidem with Shugan Jieyu in treating IDDS.
In a double-blind, randomized trial, 60 IDDS patients were assigned to zolpidem plus Shugan Jieyu (ZS) or zolpidem plus placebo (ZP) for 8 weeks, with 59 completing the study. Assessments included the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7 (GAD-7), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), polysomnography (PSG), and sleep diary. Mixed-model repeated-measures (MMRM) analysis was performed to assess the least squares means difference (LSMD) among the groups after 4 and 8 weeks of treatment. Subgroup analysis was performed on patients with sleep fragmentation (WASO ≥ 30 min).
Both groups showed significant improvements in ISI, PSQI, ESS, GAD-7, and PHQ-9, with no between-group differences. For the primary outcome (ISI), the between-group difference at week 8 was - 1.68 points (95% CI: -4.49 to 1.14; p = 0.238), corresponding to a small effect size (Cohen's d = 0.42). ZS significantly reduced WASO and increased TST at 8 weeks, whereas ZP showed no significant changes in these measures within the group. ZS reduced subjective sleep latency (sSL) significantly more than ZP at weeks 4 (LSMD - 12.21 min, 95% CI -22.54 to -1.87; p = 0.021; d = 0.23) and 8 (LSMD - 12.17 min, 95% CI -21.99 to -2.35; p = 0.016; d = 0.25). In the sleep fragmentation subgroup, ZS improved sSL and subjective sleep efficiency (sSE). Both treatments were well-tolerated.
Compared with taking zolpidem alone, the combination of zolpidem with Shugan Jieyu did not significantly improve insomnia, but showed preliminary non-objective signals in improving patients' perception of falling asleep, particularly in patients with sleep fragmentation.
The study is registered in the ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT05764798). Date registered: 30 November 2022.

objective insomnia disorder with depressive symptoms (idds) represents a significant clinical phenotype, with a bidirectional relationship where insomnia both contributes to and results from depression. this study aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of combining zolpidem with shugan jieyu in treating idds. methods in a double-blind, randomized trial, 60 idds patients were assigned to zolpidem plus shugan jieyu (zs) or zolpidem plus placebo (zp) for 8 weeks, with 59 completing the study. assessments included the insomnia severity index (isi), patient health questionnaire-9 (phq-9), generalized anxiety disorder 7 (gad-7), pittsburgh sleep quality index (psqi), epworth sleepiness scale (ess), polysomnography (psg), and sleep diary. mixed-model repeated-measures (mmrm) analysis was performed to assess the least squares means difference (lsmd) among the groups after 4 and 8 weeks of treatment. subgroup analysis was performed on patients with sleep fragmentation (waso ≥ 30 min). results both groups showed significant improvements in isi, psqi, ess, gad-7, and phq-9, with no between-group differences. for the primary outcome (isi), the between-group difference at week 8 was − 1.68 points (95% ci: -4.49 to 1.14; p = 0.238), corresponding to a small effect size (cohen’s d = 0.42). zs significantly reduced waso and increased tst at 8 weeks, whereas zp showed no significant changes in these measures within the group. zs reduced subjective sleep latency (ssl) significantly more than zp at weeks 4 (lsmd − 12.21 min, 95% ci -22.54 to -1.87; p = 0.021; d = 0.23) and 8 (lsmd − 12.17 min, 95% ci -21.99 to -2.35; p = 0.016; d = 0.25). in the sleep fragmentation subgroup, zs improved ssl and subjective sleep efficiency (sse). both treatments were well-tolerated. conclusion compared with taking zolpidem alone, the combination of zolpidem with shugan jieyu did not significantly improve insomnia, but showed preliminary non-objective signals in improving patients’ perception of falling asleep, particularly in patients with sleep fragmentation. trial registration the study is registered in the clinicaltrials.gov (nct05764798). date registered: 30 november 2022. peer review reports introduction insomnia is a prevalent sleep disorder characterized by difficulties in falling asleep or maintaining sleep, or premature or intermittent waking [ 1 ]. a significant clinical challenge is the frequent co-occurrence of insomnia with depressive symptoms, insomnia disorder with depressive symptoms (idds). the prevalence of insomnia is estimated at 10%–60% of the population [ 2 ]. insomnia is often accompanied by depressive symptoms. previous studies have revealed a bidirectional relationship between insomnia and depression, suggesting that insomnia is not just a consequence but also a predictor of depression [ 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 ]. current evidence demonstrates that approximately 66% of depressed patients experience comorbid insomnia [ 7 ], while 25% of insomnia patients develop depressive symptoms [ 4 , 8 ]. a 2024 large-scale chinese study ( n = 51,774) further quantified this overlap, showing insomnia patients had 11.3-fold higher odds of depression (95% ci: 9.58–13.29) compared to non-insomnia controls [ 9 ]. insomnia symptoms may persist even after remission in depression, which increases the risk of depression recurrence [ 6 ]. idds is a common condition in the clinical population and interventions for idds need to consider both insomnia and depressive symptoms that lead to improvement in insomnia and prevention of full-blown depression [ 10 , 11 ]. medications are increasingly used in clinical practice for the treatment of insomnia. zolpidem is a commonly used new generation of non-benzodiazepine sedatives for the treatment of insomnia [ 12 , 13 ]. however, clinical studies indicate that many patients with insomnia disorder and comorbid depressive symptoms (idds) continue to experience persistent depressive symptoms despite zolpidem treatment [ 6 ]. this is partly due to zolpidem’s limited efficacy in addressing the mood-related aspects of idds and its potential for tolerance and dependence with long-term use. additionally, the sedative effects of zolpidem can sometimes exacerbate the cognitive and emotional symptoms of depression [ 6 ]. antidepressants are widely prescribed for idds, with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (ssris)/serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (snris) (e.g., escitalopram) accounting for ~ 45% of prescriptions and sedating antidepressants (e.g., trazodone) for ~ 30%, despite limited food and drug administration (fda) approval for insomnia indications, reflecting real-world reliance on their dual mood-sleep effects [ 14 , 15 , 16 ]. according to everitt, some antidepressants improve sleep latency (sl) and may improve patients’ sleep fragmentation [ 17 ]. however, since depressive symptoms are not equivalent to depression, antidepressants are a bit extravagant when used to improve depressive symptoms. furthermore, antidepressants can cause undesirable side effects such as weight gain, sexual dysfunction, and sedation, and may lead to withdrawal symptoms upon discontinuation, which can deter long-term adherence [ 18 , 19 ]. this underscores the need for alternative therapies that can address both sleep and mood disturbances without such side effects. in addition, the use of antidepressants might have side effects and withdrawal reactions after discontinuation [ 20 , 21 ]. therefore, it is necessary to use a drug with high safety and effectiveness to improve depressive symptoms in insomnia. chinese medicine prescriptions have a long history in the treatment of depression, with significant curative effects and few adverse reactions [ 22 , 23 ]. shugan jieyu capsules, a chinese herbal medicine mainly composed of hypericum perforatum and acanthopanax senticosus , is a commonly used medication approved by the national medical products administration (nmpa) of the people’s republic of china to treat mild to moderate depression [ 24 ]. previous research provides a mechanistic rationale for the use of shugan jieyu capsules in treating insomnia, depression, and anxiety symptoms. animal studies have demonstrated that shugan jieyu reverses depression-like behaviors by enhancing phosphorylation levels in the medial prefrontal cortex and hippocampal ca3 region, as well as upregulating cyclic adenosine monophosphate response element-binding protein (creb) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (bdnf) expression [ 25 ]. clinical evidence supports these findings, with randomized controlled trials (rcts) showing that shugan jieyu capsules significantly improved insomnia, depression, and anxiety in various populations, including post-covid-19 convalescence patients [ 26 ]. additionally, zhang et al. (2014) conducted a systematic review confirming shugan jieyu capsules’ efficacy in major depressive disorder (mdd) which used data from 7 rcts highlighting its superior therapeutic effects and safety compared to placebo [ 27 ]. furthermore, combination therapy with venlafaxine has been shown to enhance depression remission rates compared to venlafaxine alone [ 27 ]. recent studies also indicate that shugan jieyu capsules can alleviate post-stroke depression-related cognitive impairment and emotional disturbances [ 28 ]. in addition, it has higher safety profiles for use in a combination regimen. therefore, shugan jieyu capsules can be considered in combination therapy to improve idds. in the current study, we conducted a double-blind, parallel-group randomized controlled trial to examine the efficacy of the combination of shugan jieyu capsules and zolpidem in idds. materials and methods participants and eligibility criteria patients with a diagnosis of idds were identified from the outpatient department. the participants were recruited in march 2023, and the last assessment was completed by october 2023. all of the subjects provided written informed consent, and the study was approved by nanfang hospital, southern medical university, china. the inclusion criteria for this study were as follows: 1. insomnia disorder, diagnosed using the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders, fifth edition (dsm-5) criteria; 2. depressive symptoms, defined as patient health questionnaire-9 (phq-9) score ≥ 10 points, but not fulfilling the dsm-5 criteria for major depressive disorder (mdd); 3. age 18–60 years; 4. no previous medication for insomnia or depression was used within the last month. the exclusion criteria were as follows: 5. allergy to specified substances, prior unsuccessful use of certain medications, recent use of specific medications affecting liver metabolism, substance or alcohol dependence, recent drug abuse, and medical conditions impacting drug metabolism; 6. recent participation in other drug studies; 7. chronic physical illness or mental disorders; 8. sleep apnea (apnea-hypopnea index [ahi] ≥ 15 events/hour) or periodic limb movement disorder (periodic limb movement index [plmi] > 15 events/hour) during baseline polysomnography; 9. night and shift workers; 10. pregnancy or lactation; 11. individuals with serious suicidal behavior or plans; 12. any other conditions deemed unsuitable for inclusion in the study. polysomnographic study nocturnal polysomnography (psg) assessments were conducted at baseline, 4 weeks, and 8 weeks. standard psg recordings included eeg (f4-m1, f3-m2, c4-m1, c3-m2, o2-m1, o1-m2), electrooculography (eog: le-a2, re-a1), submental electromyography (emg), bilateral anterior tibialis emg, electrocardiography (ecg), nasal airflow pressure, thoracic and abdominal respiratory effort sensors, pulse oximetry for oxygen saturation, breathing sound recording, and body position monitoring. all sleep parameters were determined through visual scoring of recordings according to established criteria. an experienced psg technologist, who remained blinded to the study protocol, performed quality control of all computerized sleep data. sleep staging, respiratory events, and periodic limb movements were analyzed in 30-second epochs following current aasm guidelines [ 29 ]. during baseline screening, participants exhibiting significant periodic limb movement disorder (plmi ≥ 15 events/hour) or obstructive sleep apnea (ahi ≥ 15 events/hour) were excluded from study participation. randomization and blinding in this study, block randomization was used. statisticians independent of the study used sas 9.4 to generate four-block randomization sequences. then, blinding managers, independent of the study, prepared boxes containing either shugan jieyu capsules or a placebo for 60 participants. the boxes were labeled with random numbers so that the researchers and the participants were blinded to the treatments. the researchers then distributed the capsules based on those numbers. study design the design entailed randomized (1:1), parallel-group, double-blind assignment of patients to shugan jieyu capsules in combination with zolpidem (the experimental group, zs group) or zolpidem in combination with placebo (the control group, zp group) for 8 weeks. the study design and reporting adheres to the consort guidelines. intervention in the zs group, the participants received shugan jieyu capsules (batch number: 220106, oral 0.72 g twice daily) in combination with zolpidem (batch number: 220201, oral 10 mg once daily) for 8 weeks. in the zp group, the participants received a placebo in combination with zolpidem (oral 10 mg once daily) for 8 weeks. shugan jieyu capsules and placebo (the main ingredient was inert starch) were completely consistent in sensory properties such as color, shape, smell, and taste. during the intervention period, other psychotropic drugs or any other related treatment within 8 weeks were not allowed. sample size calculation this study was a clinical trial with an 8-week duration, employing a 1:1 random allocation to the zs group and the zp group. since no prior data existed for the combination therapy, we conservatively estimated the effect size using published monotherapy results: shugan jieyu capsules can reduce insomnia severity index (isi) scores by − 11.2 [ 30 ], and zolpidem can reduce isi scores by − 6.8 [ 31 ]. assuming no synergistic effects, we projected an intergroup difference of 4.4 (11.2–6.8) with a standard deviation of 4.5. with a two-sided α of 0.05 and 85% power, each group required 23 subjects. considering a dropout rate of 20%, each group would need 30 subjects, resulting in a total estimated requirement of 60 subjects. outcome measures and measurements the primary outcome measure for the study was the change in isi score at week 8, which was determined as the reduction in isi score from baseline, providing a patient-reported outcome measure of insomnia severity [ 32 ]. the secondary outcome measures were as follows: 13. phq-9 to assess depressive symptoms [ 33 ], 14. generalized anxiety disorder 7 (gad-7) to assess anxiety symptoms [ 34 ], 15. epworth sleepiness scale (ess) to assess excessive daytime sleepiness [ 35 ], 16. the pittsburgh sleep quality index (psqi) to assess sleep quality [ 36 ], 17. quality of life enjoyment and satisfaction questionnaire-short form (q-les-q-sf) to assess the quality of life [ 37 ], 18. polysomnography (psg) parameters, including total sleep time (tst), sl, wake after sleep onset (waso), and sleep efficiency (se), for objective sleep evaluation [ 38 ], 19. sleep diary–extracted parameters, including subjective sl (ssl), subjective waso (swaso), subjective se (sse), and subjective tst (stst), for subjective sleep evaluation. all outcomes were evaluated from baseline to weeks 4 and 8. all adverse events that occurred or worsened between dosing day 1 and week 8 were recorded. statistical analysis descriptive statistics, including means and standard deviations for continuous variables and frequencies with percentages for categorical variables, were reported. results were reported in line with the consort guidelines [ 39 ]. primary efficacy analyses were conducted on a per-protocol evaluable population consisting of all randomized participants who: (1) received ≥ 1 dose of study medication, (2) completed baseline assessments, and (3) provided ≥ 1 post-baseline efficacy evaluation ( n = 59/60). one participant withdrew before any post-baseline assessments and was excluded from all analyses. two-tailed tests were used in all statistical analyses in sas (version 9.4), with p < 0.05 indicating statistical significance. mixed-model repeated-measures (mmrm) analysis on the final value of each measure (at baseline, week 4, and week 8), with group, baseline total score, time, and time × group interaction, was performed to assess the least squares means difference (lsmd) among the groups after 4 and 8 weeks of treatment. effect sizes (cohen’s d) were calculated for between-group comparisons (lsmd divided by pooled baseline standard deviation (sd)) and within-group changes (mean change divided by baseline sd), with interpretation thresholds of 0.2 (small), 0.5 (medium), and 0.8 (large). the analysis was applied to determine whether the overall course of change over the 8 weeks was different between the two groups. the mixed model is similar to ordinary least squares regression but has the advantage of using all the data. furthermore, a t- test was carried out to evaluate the difference between the groups at 4 weeks and 8 weeks. given that sleep fragmentation is a key feature of insomnia, a subgroup analysis was carried out in idds with sleep fragmentation. the analysis was an exploratory, non-prespecified analysis using the same analytical methods to investigate potential differential treatment effects in this clinically relevant subgroup. results participants a total of 60 patients were initially enrolled and randomly assigned to treatment. of these, one patient dropped out before receiving the minimum 4 weeks of treatment to qualify for the evaluable sample. the reason for dropping out was a change in medication requested by the patient. a total of 59 patients completed the requirements of the protocol. there were no significant differences in subject retention at the trial endpoint (week 8: zs, 30/30; zp, 29/30; χ 2 = 1.017, df = 1, p = 0.313). the study flow diagram is shown in fig. 1 . fig. 1 consolidated consort study flow diagram full size image table 1 provides descriptive statistics for baseline

(week 4: +5.9%, d = 0.57; week 8: +5.4%, d = 0.52). between-group differences were non-significant for all parameters (all p > 0.05), with effect sizes ranging from negligible to small (d = −0.12 to

table 5 . in both groups, a comparable proportion of patients reported adverse events throughout the trial, namely a total of 25 (86.2%) in the zp group and 23 (76.7%) in the zs group. all intervention-related aes were categorized as “possibly related” after investigator assessment and all reported aes were grade 1 (mild) in severity. drowsiness, dizziness, nausea and vomiting were the common side effects reported. there was no increase in side effects after combining shugan jieyu capsules with zolpidem. table 5 incidence of adverse events in the zs and zp groups full size table discussion the main finding of this study was that the combination of shugan jieyu capsules and zolpidem significantly decreased ssl in idds. for patients with sleep fragmentation, the combination regimen improved sse in addition to ssl. in psg, the combination regimen showed within-group improvement in tst and waso at 8 weeks. this study’s primary outcome, that is change in isi, showed no significant difference between zolpidem monotherapy and combination therapy with shugan jieyu. both groups showed significant improvements in insomnia severity (isi), sleep quality (psqi), excessive daytime sleepiness (ess), anxiety symptoms (gad-7), depressive symptoms (phq-9), and quality of life (q-les-q-sf). in this study, both subjective and objective sleep parameters were improved. however, the patients from the zs group reported a significant decrease in ssl, while objective sleep parameters did not reflect this change. this is in line with the well-documented phenomenon of subjective-objective sleep discrepancy in insomnia, where patient-reported sleep improvements often occur independently of changes in objective polysomnographic measures [ 40 , 41 ]. objective and subjective sleep measures often diverge in insomnia patients. previous research has shown that patients with insomnia often report their sleep characteristics as being more severe than indicated by objective measurements. as sleep improves, the patient’s perception of sleep also improves, significantly shortening the ssl. however, the first-night effect (fne) may influence objective results [ 42 , 43 ]. the quantitative criteria for insomnia define insomnia as occurring at least three nights per week. hence, one night of psg is likely to be insufficient to fully capture insomnia symptoms [ 44 , 45 ]. in addition, when our bodies try to enter a resting state in an unfamiliar environment, one hemisphere of the brain will be more alert than usual in psg. this is a balancing mechanism generated during sleep to guard against potential dangers [ 46 ]. previous studies have shown that zolpidem improves subjective and objective sleep [ 47 ], and current combination therapy significantly reduced ssl compared with zolpidem monotherapy. moreover, the zs group showed statistically significant within-group improvement in tst and waso at 8 weeks, which was not observed in the zp group. this indicates that the combination of shugan jieyu capsules and zolpidem may have the potential to improve subjective sleep quality and sleep continuity. the ssl finding, while potentially clinically relevant, requires cautious interpretation due to multiple comparisons and lack of objective corroboration. in addition, our study showed that in idds with sleep fragmentation, the combination of shugan jieyu capsules and zolpidem significantly reduced ssl and enhanced sse. these results suggest that individuals with more pronounced sleep fragmentation may benefit from a combination with shugan jieyu capsules, possibly due to the inhibitory effects of acanthopanax senticosus on serotonin synthesis and antioxidative stress damage, contributing to sedation and calming of nerves. this is consistent with a recent meta-analysis confirming that shugan jieyu capsule combination therapy significantly improves sleep quality in patients with insomnia [ 26 , 48 ]. futhermore, the combination of shugan jieyu capsules and non-benzodiazepine drugs improved the overall clinical effectiveness in patients with insomnia [ 48 ]. sleep fragmentation, characterized by frequent awakenings, is a hallmark of insomnia disorder and has been linked to heightened emotional dysregulation and depressive symptoms [ 6 , 49 ]. better se is associated with better subjectively perceived sleep quality [ 50 , 51 , 52 ]. this effect may be attributed to the complementary mechanisms of the two interventions: while zolpidem (a short-acting gabaergic hypnotic) primarily facilitates sleep initiation, shugan jieyu—through bioactive compounds (e.g., acanthopanax senticosus , hypericum perforatum ) —modulates monoaminergic neurotransmission (e.g., serotonin, bdnf) function [ 12 , 13 , 25 , 53 ], thereby enhancing sleep continuity and reducing fragmentation. in this study, we found that both groups showed significant improvements in isi, psqi, ess, gad-7, phq-9, and q-les-q-sf, without between-group differences. our findings highlight the efficacy of both treatments in reducing insomnia, excessive daytime sleepiness, anxiety symptoms, and depressive symptoms, while also enhancing sleep quality and overall quality of life (all p < 0.05 in each group), consistent with prior research. zolpidem improves subjective and objective insomnia symptoms by acting selectively on the central nervous system ω 1 receptor, producing strong sedative and hypnotic effects, with a mild reduction in anxiety and depressive symptoms [ 53 , 54 , 55 , 56 ]. in addition, a significant reduction in sl and waso may lead to a reduction in anxiety and worry at the beginning of sleep and waking up at midnight, thereby further improving anxiety and depressive symptoms [ 57 ]. moreover, due to the improvement in sleep, there might be a reduction in sleep-related anxiety and depressive symptoms by changing their perception of sleep [ 58 , 59 ]. however, some depressive symptoms may be secondary to poor sleep and, if sleep problems are addressed, depressive symptoms may improve [ 6 , 60 ]. those might be the reasons for the improvement of depressive and anxiety symptoms in both groups without between-group differences. zolpidem is a non-benzodiazepine hypnotic widely used in the treatment of insomnia. it functions by binding to the alpha-1 subunit of the γ-aminobutyric acid type a (gaba-a) receptor, exerting hypnotic effects through neuronal inhibition similar to benzodiazepines. clinical trial have demonstrated that zolpidem effectively reduces sleep latency by an average of 20 min and sustains these results in the long term [ 12 , 61 , 62 ]. it is available in various formulations, with immediate-release zolpidem being particularly effective at reducing sl and increasing tst. however, zolpidem has been associated with several adverse effects, including complex sleep-related behaviors like sleepwalking, hallucinations, increased suicidality, and even rare cases of committing homicide [ 12 , 63 ]. the shugan jieyu capsules are a herbal remedy primarily composed of extracts from hypericum perforatum (st. john’s wort) and acanthopanax senticosus . hypericum perforatum has been used for centuries as an antidepressant, functioning through mechanisms such as serotonin receptor modulation, monoamine oxidase inhibition, and neuroendocrine and ion channel modulation [ 53 ]. clinical studies have shown that it is significantly more effective than placebo and comparable to standard antidepressants such as fluoxetine and sertraline in treating depressive disorder [ 64 ]. the addition of acanthopanax senticosus may enhance the capsules’ effectiveness in improving sl and reducing oxidative stress, providing neuroprotection, and calming nerves [ 53 ]. zolpidem and shugan jieyu both offer unique benefits in treating insomnia, though through different mechanisms. zolpidem primarily focuses on improving sl and tst through its hypnotic effects, but carries risks of significant neuropsychiatric side effects [ 12 , 63 ]. in contrast, shugan jieyu , with its combination of hypericum perforatum and acanthopanax senticosus , provides both antidepressant and sedative effects with a more favorable side effect profile for those with depressive symptoms [ 53 ]. combining zolpidem with shugan jieyu may offer a superior treatment strategy for patients suffering from both insomnia and depressive symptoms. the rationale for this combination lies in the complementary effects of the two treatments: zolpidem provides immediate relief for sleep initiation [ 12 ], while shugan jieyu addresses the underlying mood dysregulation and improves sleep continuity [ 53 ], potentially leading to more sustained improvements. furthermore, our study’s safety results support this strategy, demonstrating that the combination was well-tolerated with no significant increase in adverse events compared to zolpidem monotherapy (table 5 ). this dual approach may not only improve sleep quality, but also address the underlying depression, which is often intertwined with insomnia [ 65 ]. while no significant between-group differences were observed in psg measures, the clinically meaningful improvements in ssl and sse with shugan jieyu supplementation are noteworthy. subjective sleep perception often diverges from objective metrics in insomnia, and patient-reported outcomes are critical determinants of treatment success [ 66 , 67 ]. the reduction in ssl and enhanced sse suggest that shugan jieyu may ameliorate the hyperarousal and cognitive distortions characteristic of insomnia disorder [ 68 ], particularly in patients with sleep fragmentation. however, the clinical relevance of this reduction remains uncertain, as the between-group effect sizes were small (cohen’s d = 0.23–0.25) and were not supported by objective psg measures. while patient-reported outcomes are valuable, a statistically significant but small improvement in ssl may not translate into a meaningful clinical benefit. these subjective improvements align with evidence that perceived sleep quality strongly influences daytime functioning and mood. thus, even in the absence of psg-detected changes [ 58 , 68 ], the alleviation of patient-reported distress may translate to better adherence, reduced depressive symptoms, and improved quality of life in managing insomnia with comorbid depressive features. furthermore, there is evidence suggesting that treating insomnia can lead to significant reductions in depressive severity, and these improvements are often maintained during follow-up [ 65 ]. therefore, the combination of zolpidem and shugan jieyu benefits from the antidepressant and sleep-enhancing properties of shugan jieyu . this multifaceted approach aligns well with the need for a multidisciplinary strategy in treating insomnia, particularly when comorbid with depressive symptoms [ 12 , 65 ]. limitations although our research has advantages, there are still some limitations that need to be considered. first, the relatively small sample sizes for each group may have reduced the statistical power to detect more significant group differences. second, the study was done in a single center. third, the intervention and follow-up periods in this study were relatively short. fourth, lack objective biomarker (e.g., serum bdnf) to correlate with clinical outcomes. short-term follow-up (8 weeks) precluded assessment of relapse rates. fifth, while we observed improvements in subjective sleep measures, the lack of objective psg concordance and multiple secondary analyses increase the risk of type i error. these findings should therefore be considered exploratory. future directions future studies should address the limitations of this study. specifically, longer intervention and follow-up periods are needed to assess the durability of the effects of zolpidem and shugan jieyu capsules in insomnia with comorbid depression. multi-center trials with larger, more diverse samples will improve the generalizability of the findings. additionally, research into the mechanisms of their synergistic effects, particularly through markers like bdnf and eeg sleep patterns, is warranted to better understand their molecular interactions. conclusions compared with taking zolpidem alone, the combination of zolpidem with shugan jieyu did not significantly improve insomnia, but showed preliminary non-objective signals in improving patients’ perception of falling asleep, particularly in patients with sleep fragmentation. data availability the data will be available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request. abbreviations aasm:

insomnia is a prevalent sleep disorder characterized by difficulties in falling asleep or maintaining sleep, or premature or intermittent waking [ 1 ]. a significant clinical challenge is the frequent co-occurrence of insomnia with depressive symptoms, insomnia disorder with depressive symptoms (idds). the prevalence of insomnia is estimated at 10%–60% of the population [ 2 ]. insomnia is often accompanied by depressive symptoms. previous studies have revealed a bidirectional relationship between insomnia and depression, suggesting that insomnia is not just a consequence but also a predictor of depression [ 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 ]. current evidence demonstrates that approximately 66% of depressed patients experience comorbid insomnia [ 7 ], while 25% of insomnia patients develop depressive symptoms [ 4 , 8 ]. a 2024 large-scale chinese study ( n = 51,774) further quantified this overlap, showing insomnia patients had 11.3-fold higher odds of depression (95% ci: 9.58–13.29) compared to non-insomnia controls [ 9 ]. insomnia symptoms may persist even after remission in depression, which increases the risk of depression recurrence [ 6 ]. idds is a common condition in the clinical population and interventions for idds need to consider both insomnia and depressive symptoms that lead to improvement in insomnia and prevention of full-blown depression [ 10 , 11 ]. medications are increasingly used in clinical practice for the treatment of insomnia. zolpidem is a commonly used new generation of non-benzodiazepine sedatives for the treatment of insomnia [ 12 , 13 ]. however, clinical studies indicate that many patients with insomnia disorder and comorbid depressive symptoms (idds) continue to experience persistent depressive symptoms despite zolpidem treatment [ 6 ]. this is partly due to zolpidem’s limited efficacy in addressing the mood-related aspects of idds and its potential for tolerance and dependence with long-term use. additionally, the sedative effects of zolpidem can sometimes exacerbate the cognitive and emotional symptoms of depression [ 6 ]. antidepressants are widely prescribed for idds, with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (ssris)/serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (snris) (e.g., escitalopram) accounting for ~ 45% of prescriptions and sedating antidepressants (e.g., trazodone) for ~ 30%, despite limited food and drug administration (fda) approval for insomnia indications, reflecting real-world reliance on their dual mood-sleep effects [ 14 , 15 , 16 ]. according to everitt, some antidepressants improve sleep latency (sl) and may improve patients’ sleep fragmentation [ 17 ]. however, since depressive symptoms are not equivalent to depression, antidepressants are a bit extravagant when used to improve depressive symptoms. furthermore, antidepressants can cause undesirable side effects such as weight gain, sexual dysfunction, and sedation, and may lead to withdrawal symptoms upon discontinuation, which can deter long-term adherence [ 18 , 19 ]. this underscores the need for alternative therapies that can address both sleep and mood disturbances without such side effects. in addition, the use of antidepressants might have side effects and withdrawal reactions after discontinuation [ 20 , 21 ]. therefore, it is necessary to use a drug with high safety and effectiveness to improve depressive symptoms in insomnia. chinese medicine prescriptions have a long history in the treatment of depression, with significant curative effects and few adverse reactions [ 22 , 23 ]. shugan jieyu capsules, a chinese herbal medicine mainly composed of hypericum perforatum and acanthopanax senticosus , is a commonly used medication approved by the national medical products administration (nmpa) of the people’s republic of china to treat mild to moderate depression [ 24 ]. previous research provides a mechanistic rationale for the use of shugan jieyu capsules in treating insomnia, depression, and anxiety symptoms. animal studies have demonstrated that shugan jieyu reverses depression-like behaviors by enhancing phosphorylation levels in the medial prefrontal cortex and hippocampal ca3 region, as well as upregulating cyclic adenosine monophosphate response element-binding protein (creb) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (bdnf) expression [ 25 ]. clinical evidence supports these findings, with randomized controlled trials (rcts) showing that shugan jieyu capsules significantly improved insomnia, depression, and anxiety in various populations, including post-covid-19 convalescence patients [ 26 ]. additionally, zhang et al. (2014) conducted a systematic review confirming shugan jieyu capsules’ efficacy in major depressive disorder (mdd) which used data from 7 rcts highlighting its superior therapeutic effects and safety compared to placebo [ 27 ]. furthermore, combination therapy with venlafaxine has been shown to enhance depression remission rates compared to venlafaxine alone [ 27 ]. recent studies also indicate that shugan jieyu capsules can alleviate post-stroke depression-related cognitive impairment and emotional disturbances [ 28 ]. in addition, it has higher safety profiles for use in a combination regimen. therefore, shugan jieyu capsules can be considered in combination therapy to improve idds. in the current study, we conducted a double-blind, parallel-group randomized controlled trial to examine the efficacy of the combination of shugan jieyu capsules and zolpidem in idds. materials and methods participants and eligibility criteria patients with a diagnosis of idds were identified from the outpatient department. the participants were recruited in march 2023, and the last assessment was completed by october 2023. all of the subjects provided written informed consent, and the study was approved by nanfang hospital, southern medical university, china. the inclusion criteria for this study were as follows: 1. insomnia disorder, diagnosed using the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders, fifth edition (dsm-5) criteria; 2. depressive symptoms, defined as patient health questionnaire-9 (phq-9) score ≥ 10 points, but not fulfilling the dsm-5 criteria for major depressive disorder (mdd); 3. age 18–60 years; 4. no previous medication for insomnia or depression was used within the last month. the exclusion criteria were as follows: 5. allergy to specified substances, prior unsuccessful use of certain medications, recent use of specific medications affecting liver metabolism, substance or alcohol dependence, recent drug abuse, and medical conditions impacting drug metabolism; 6. recent participation in other drug studies; 7. chronic physical illness or mental disorders; 8. sleep apnea (apnea-hypopnea index [ahi] ≥ 15 events/hour) or periodic limb movement disorder (periodic limb movement index [plmi] > 15 events/hour) during baseline polysomnography; 9. night and shift workers; 10. pregnancy or lactation; 11. individuals with serious suicidal behavior or plans; 12. any other conditions deemed unsuitable for inclusion in the study. polysomnographic study nocturnal polysomnography (psg) assessments were conducted at baseline, 4 weeks, and 8 weeks. standard psg recordings included eeg (f4-m1, f3-m2, c4-m1, c3-m2, o2-m1, o1-m2), electrooculography (eog: le-a2, re-a1), submental electromyography (emg), bilateral anterior tibialis emg, electrocardiography (ecg), nasal airflow pressure, thoracic and abdominal respiratory effort sensors, pulse oximetry for oxygen saturation, breathing sound recording, and body position monitoring. all sleep parameters were determined through visual scoring of recordings according to established criteria. an experienced psg technologist, who remained blinded to the study protocol, performed quality control of all computerized sleep data. sleep staging, respiratory events, and periodic limb movements were analyzed in 30-second epochs following current aasm guidelines [ 29 ]. during baseline screening, participants exhibiting significant periodic limb movement disorder (plmi ≥ 15 events/hour) or obstructive sleep apnea (ahi ≥ 15 events/hour) were excluded from study participation. randomization and blinding in this study, block randomization was used. statisticians independent of the study used sas 9.4 to generate four-block randomization sequences. then, blinding managers, independent of the study, prepared boxes containing either shugan jieyu capsules or a placebo for 60 participants. the boxes were labeled with random numbers so that the researchers and the participants were blinded to the treatments. the researchers then distributed the capsules based on those numbers. study design the design entailed randomized (1:1), parallel-group, double-blind assignment of patients to shugan jieyu capsules in combination with zolpidem (the experimental group, zs group) or zolpidem in combination with placebo (the control group, zp group) for 8 weeks. the study design and reporting adheres to the consort guidelines. intervention in the zs group, the participants received shugan jieyu capsules (batch number: 220106, oral 0.72 g twice daily) in combination with zolpidem (batch number: 220201, oral 10 mg once daily) for 8 weeks. in the zp group, the participants received a placebo in combination with zolpidem (oral 10 mg once daily) for 8 weeks. shugan jieyu capsules and placebo (the main ingredient was inert starch) were completely consistent in sensory properties such as color, shape, smell, and taste. during the intervention period, other psychotropic drugs or any other related treatment within 8 weeks were not allowed. sample size calculation this study was a clinical trial with an 8-week duration, employing a 1:1 random allocation to the zs group and the zp group. since no prior data existed for the combination therapy, we conservatively estimated the effect size using published monotherapy results: shugan jieyu capsules can reduce insomnia severity index (isi) scores by − 11.2 [ 30 ], and zolpidem can reduce isi scores by − 6.8 [ 31 ]. assuming no synergistic effects, we projected an intergroup difference of 4.4 (11.2–6.8) with a standard deviation of 4.5. with a two-sided α of 0.05 and 85% power, each group required 23 subjects. considering a dropout rate of 20%, each group would need 30 subjects, resulting in a total estimated requirement of 60 subjects. outcome measures and measurements the primary outcome measure for the study was the change in isi score at week 8, which was determined as the reduction in isi score from baseline, providing a patient-reported outcome measure of insomnia severity [ 32 ]. the secondary outcome measures were as follows: 13. phq-9 to assess depressive symptoms [ 33 ], 14. generalized anxiety disorder 7 (gad-7) to assess anxiety symptoms [ 34 ], 15. epworth sleepiness scale (ess) to assess excessive daytime sleepiness [ 35 ], 16. the pittsburgh sleep quality index (psqi) to assess sleep quality [ 36 ], 17. quality of life enjoyment and satisfaction questionnaire-short form (q-les-q-sf) to assess the quality of life [ 37 ], 18. polysomnography (psg) parameters, including total sleep time (tst), sl, wake after sleep onset (waso), and sleep efficiency (se), for objective sleep evaluation [ 38 ], 19. sleep diary–extracted parameters, including subjective sl (ssl), subjective waso (swaso), subjective se (sse), and subjective tst (stst), for subjective sleep evaluation. all outcomes were evaluated from baseline to weeks 4 and 8. all adverse events that occurred or worsened between dosing day 1 and week 8 were recorded. statistical analysis descriptive statistics, including means and standard deviations for continuous variables and frequencies with percentages for categorical variables, were reported. results were reported in line with the consort guidelines [ 39 ]. primary efficacy analyses were conducted on a per-protocol evaluable population consisting of all randomized participants who: (1) received ≥ 1 dose of study medication, (2) completed baseline assessments, and (3) provided ≥ 1 post-baseline efficacy evaluation ( n = 59/60). one participant withdrew before any post-baseline assessments and was excluded from all analyses. two-tailed tests were used in all statistical analyses in sas (version 9.4), with p < 0.05 indicating statistical significance. mixed-model repeated-measures (mmrm) analysis on the final value of each measure (at baseline, week 4, and week 8), with group, baseline total score, time, and time × group interaction, was performed to assess the least squares means difference (lsmd) among the groups after 4 and 8 weeks of treatment. effect sizes (cohen’s d) were calculated for between-group comparisons (lsmd divided by pooled baseline standard deviation (sd)) and within-group changes (mean change divided by baseline sd), with interpretation thresholds of 0.2 (small), 0.5 (medium), and 0.8 (large). the analysis was applied to determine whether the overall course of change over the 8 weeks was different between the two groups. the mixed model is similar to ordinary least squares regression but has the advantage of using all the data. furthermore, a t- test was carried out to evaluate the difference between the groups at 4 weeks and 8 weeks. given that sleep fragmentation is a key feature of insomnia, a subgroup analysis was carried out in idds with sleep fragmentation. the analysis was an exploratory, non-prespecified analysis using the same analytical methods to investigate potential differential treatment effects in this clinically relevant subgroup. results participants a total of 60 patients were initially enrolled and randomly assigned to treatment. of these, one patient dropped out before receiving the minimum 4 weeks of treatment to qualify for the evaluable sample. the reason for dropping out was a change in medication requested by the patient. a total of 59 patients completed the requirements of the protocol. there were no significant differences in subject retention at the trial endpoint (week 8: zs, 30/30; zp, 29/30; χ 2 = 1.017, df = 1, p = 0.313). the study flow diagram is shown in fig. 1 . fig. 1 consolidated consort study flow diagram full size image table 1 provides descriptive statistics for baseline characteristics of the zs and zp groups. fifty-nine participants diagnosed with idds completed the trial, with a mean age of 27.5 ± 6.7 years. among them, 39.0% were male. a total of 48 (81.36%) were found to have a waso score of at least 30 min. table 1 baseline demographic and clinical characteristics in the zs and zp groups full size table clinical scales, psg, and sleep diary outcomes between

(week 4: +5.9%, d = 0.57; week 8: +5.4%, d = 0.52). between-group differences were non-significant for all parameters (all p > 0.05), with effect sizes ranging from negligible to small (d = −0.12 to

table 5 . in both groups, a comparable proportion of patients reported adverse events throughout the trial, namely a total of 25 (86.2%) in the zp group and 23 (76.7%) in the zs group. all intervention-related aes were categorized as “possibly related” after investigator assessment and all reported aes were grade 1 (mild) in severity. drowsiness, dizziness, nausea and vomiting were the common side effects reported. there was no increase in side effects after combining shugan jieyu capsules with zolpidem. table 5 incidence of adverse events in the zs and zp groups full size table discussion the main finding of this study was that the combination of shugan jieyu capsules and zolpidem significantly decreased ssl in idds. for patients with sleep fragmentation, the combination regimen improved sse in addition to ssl. in psg, the combination regimen showed within-group improvement in tst and waso at 8 weeks. this study’s primary outcome, that is change in isi, showed no significant difference between zolpidem monotherapy and combination therapy with shugan jieyu. both groups showed significant improvements in insomnia severity (isi), sleep quality (psqi), excessive daytime sleepiness (ess), anxiety symptoms (gad-7), depressive symptoms (phq-9), and quality of life (q-les-q-sf). in this study, both subjective and objective sleep parameters were improved. however, the patients from the zs group reported a significant decrease in ssl, while objective sleep parameters did not reflect this change. this is in line with the well-documented phenomenon of subjective-objective sleep discrepancy in insomnia, where patient-reported sleep improvements often occur independently of changes in objective polysomnographic measures [ 40 , 41 ]. objective and subjective sleep measures often diverge in insomnia patients. previous research has shown that patients with insomnia often report their sleep characteristics as being more severe than indicated by objective measurements. as sleep improves, the patient’s perception of sleep also improves, significantly shortening the ssl. however, the first-night effect (fne) may influence objective results [ 42 , 43 ]. the quantitative criteria for insomnia define insomnia as occurring at least three nights per week. hence, one night of psg is likely to be insufficient to fully capture insomnia symptoms [ 44 , 45 ]. in addition, when our bodies try to enter a resting state in an unfamiliar environment, one hemisphere of the brain will be more alert than usual in psg. this is a balancing mechanism generated during sleep to guard against potential dangers [ 46 ]. previous studies have shown that zolpidem improves subjective and objective sleep [ 47 ], and current combination therapy significantly reduced ssl compared with zolpidem monotherapy. moreover, the zs group showed statistically significant within-group improvement in tst and waso at 8 weeks, which was not observed in the zp group. this indicates that the combination of shugan jieyu capsules and zolpidem may have the potential to improve subjective sleep quality and sleep continuity. the ssl finding, while potentially clinically relevant, requires cautious interpretation due to multiple comparisons and lack of objective corroboration. in addition, our study showed that in idds with sleep fragmentation, the combination of shugan jieyu capsules and zolpidem significantly reduced ssl and enhanced sse. these results suggest that individuals with more pronounced sleep fragmentation may benefit from a combination with shugan jieyu capsules, possibly due to the inhibitory effects of acanthopanax senticosus on serotonin synthesis and antioxidative stress damage, contributing to sedation and calming of nerves. this is consistent with a recent meta-analysis confirming that shugan jieyu capsule combination therapy significantly improves sleep quality in patients with insomnia [ 26 , 48 ]. futhermore, the combination of shugan jieyu capsules and non-benzodiazepine drugs improved the overall clinical effectiveness in patients with insomnia [ 48 ]. sleep fragmentation, characterized by frequent awakenings, is a hallmark of insomnia disorder and has been linked to heightened emotional dysregulation and depressive symptoms [ 6 , 49 ]. better se is associated with better subjectively perceived sleep quality [ 50 , 51 , 52 ]. this effect may be attributed to the complementary mechanisms of the two interventions: while zolpidem (a short-acting gabaergic hypnotic) primarily facilitates sleep initiation, shugan jieyu—through bioactive compounds (e.g., acanthopanax senticosus , hypericum perforatum ) —modulates monoaminergic neurotransmission (e.g., serotonin, bdnf) function [ 12 , 13 , 25 , 53 ], thereby enhancing sleep continuity and reducing fragmentation. in this study, we found that both groups showed significant improvements in isi, psqi, ess, gad-7, phq-9, and q-les-q-sf, without between-group differences. our findings highlight the efficacy of both treatments in reducing insomnia, excessive daytime sleepiness, anxiety symptoms, and depressive symptoms, while also enhancing sleep quality and overall quality of life (all p < 0.05 in each group), consistent with prior research. zolpidem improves subjective and objective insomnia symptoms by acting selectively on the central nervous system ω 1 receptor, producing strong sedative and hypnotic effects, with a mild reduction in anxiety and depressive symptoms [ 53 , 54 , 55 , 56 ]. in addition, a significant reduction in sl and waso may lead to a reduction in anxiety and worry at the beginning of sleep and waking up at midnight, thereby further improving anxiety and depressive symptoms [ 57 ]. moreover, due to the improvement in sleep, there might be a reduction in sleep-related anxiety and depressive symptoms by changing their perception of sleep [ 58 , 59 ]. however, some depressive symptoms may be secondary to poor sleep and, if sleep problems are addressed, depressive symptoms may improve [ 6 , 60 ]. those might be the reasons for the improvement of depressive and anxiety symptoms in both groups without between-group differences. zolpidem is a non-benzodiazepine hypnotic widely used in the treatment of insomnia. it functions by binding to the alpha-1 subunit of the γ-aminobutyric acid type a (gaba-a) receptor, exerting hypnotic effects through neuronal inhibition similar to benzodiazepines. clinical trial have demonstrated that zolpidem effectively reduces sleep latency by an average of 20 min and sustains these results in the long term [ 12 , 61 , 62 ]. it is available in various formulations, with immediate-release zolpidem being particularly effective at reducing sl and increasing tst. however, zolpidem has been associated with several adverse effects, including complex sleep-related behaviors like sleepwalking, hallucinations, increased suicidality, and even rare cases of committing homicide [ 12 , 63 ]. the shugan jieyu capsules are a herbal remedy primarily composed of extracts from hypericum perforatum (st. john’s wort) and acanthopanax senticosus . hypericum perforatum has been used for centuries as an antidepressant, functioning through mechanisms such as serotonin receptor modulation, monoamine oxidase inhibition, and neuroendocrine and ion channel modulation [ 53 ]. clinical studies have shown that it is significantly more effective than placebo and comparable to standard antidepressants such as fluoxetine and sertraline in treating depressive disorder [ 64 ]. the addition of acanthopanax senticosus may enhance the capsules’ effectiveness in improving sl and reducing oxidative stress, providing neuroprotection, and calming nerves [ 53 ]. zolpidem and shugan jieyu both offer unique benefits in treating insomnia, though through different mechanisms. zolpidem primarily focuses on improving sl and tst through its hypnotic effects, but carries risks of significant neuropsychiatric side effects [ 12 , 63 ]. in contrast, shugan jieyu , with its combination of hypericum perforatum and acanthopanax senticosus , provides both antidepressant and sedative effects with a more favorable side effect profile for those with depressive symptoms [ 53 ]. combining zolpidem with shugan jieyu may offer a superior treatment strategy for patients suffering from both insomnia and depressive symptoms. the rationale for this combination lies in the complementary effects of the two treatments: zolpidem provides immediate relief for sleep initiation [ 12 ], while shugan jieyu addresses the underlying mood dysregulation and improves sleep continuity [ 53 ], potentially leading to more sustained improvements. furthermore, our study’s safety results support this strategy, demonstrating that the combination was well-tolerated with no significant increase in adverse events compared to zolpidem monotherapy (table 5 ). this dual approach may not only improve sleep quality, but also address the underlying depression, which is often intertwined with insomnia [ 65 ]. while no significant between-group differences were observed in psg measures, the clinically meaningful improvements in ssl and sse with shugan jieyu supplementation are noteworthy. subjective sleep perception often diverges from objective metrics in insomnia, and patient-reported outcomes are critical determinants of treatment success [ 66 , 67 ]. the reduction in ssl and enhanced sse suggest that shugan jieyu may ameliorate the hyperarousal and cognitive distortions characteristic of insomnia disorder [ 68 ], particularly in patients with sleep fragmentation. however, the clinical relevance of this reduction remains uncertain, as the between-group effect sizes were small (cohen’s d = 0.23–0.25) and were not supported by objective psg measures. while patient-reported outcomes are valuable, a statistically significant but small improvement in ssl may not translate into a meaningful clinical benefit. these subjective improvements align with evidence that perceived sleep quality strongly influences daytime functioning and mood. thus, even in the absence of psg-detected changes [ 58 , 68 ], the alleviation of patient-reported distress may translate to better adherence, reduced depressive symptoms, and improved quality of life in managing insomnia with comorbid depressive features. furthermore, there is evidence suggesting that treating insomnia can lead to significant reductions in depressive severity, and these improvements are often maintained during follow-up [ 65 ]. therefore, the combination of zolpidem and shugan jieyu benefits from the antidepressant and sleep-enhancing properties of shugan jieyu . this multifaceted approach aligns well with the need for a multidisciplinary strategy in treating insomnia, particularly when comorbid with depressive symptoms [ 12 , 65 ]. limitations although our research has advantages, there are still some limitations that need to be considered. first, the relatively small sample sizes for each group may have reduced the statistical power to detect more significant group differences. second, the study was done in a single center. third, the intervention and follow-up periods in this study were relatively short. fourth, lack objective biomarker (e.g., serum bdnf) to correlate with clinical outcomes. short-term follow-up (8 weeks) precluded assessment of relapse rates. fifth, while we observed improvements in subjective sleep measures, the lack of objective psg concordance and multiple secondary analyses increase the risk of type i error. these findings should therefore be considered exploratory. future directions future studies should address the limitations of this study. specifically, longer intervention and follow-up periods are needed to assess the durability of the effects of zolpidem and shugan jieyu capsules in insomnia with comorbid depression. multi-center trials with larger, more diverse samples will improve the generalizability of the findings. additionally, research into the mechanisms of their synergistic effects, particularly through markers like bdnf and eeg sleep patterns, is warranted to better understand their molecular interactions. conclusions compared with taking zolpidem alone, the combination of zolpidem with shugan jieyu did not significantly improve insomnia, but showed preliminary non-objective signals in improving patients’ perception of falling asleep, particularly in patients with sleep fragmentation. data availability the data will be available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request. abbreviations aasm:

.## Methods
in a double-blind, randomized trial, 60 idds patients were assigned to zolpidem plus shugan jieyu (zs) or zolpidem plus placebo (zp) for 8 weeks, with 59 completing the study. assessments included the insomnia severity index (isi), patient health questionnaire-9 (phq-9), generalized anxiety disorder 7 (gad-7), pittsburgh sleep quality index (psqi), epworth sleepiness scale (ess), polysomnography (psg), and sleep diary. mixed-model repeated-measures (mmrm) analysis was performed to assess the least squares means difference (lsmd) among the groups after 4 and 8 weeks of treatment. subgroup analysis was performed on patients with sleep fragmentation (waso ≥ 30 min). results both groups showed significant improvements in isi, psqi, ess, gad-7, and phq-9, with no between-group differences. for the primary outcome (isi), the between-group difference at week 8 was − 1.68 points (95% ci: -4.49 to 1.14; p = 0.238), corresponding to a small effect size (cohen’s d = 0.42). zs significantly reduced waso and increased tst at 8 weeks, whereas zp showed no significant changes in these measures within the group. zs reduced subjective sleep latency (ssl) significantly more than zp at weeks 4 (lsmd − 12.21 min, 95% ci -22.54 to -1.87; p = 0.021; d = 0.23) and 8 (lsmd − 12.17 min, 95% ci -21.99 to -2.35; p = 0.016; d = 0.25). in the sleep fragmentation subgroup, zs improved ssl and subjective sleep efficiency (sse). both treatments were well-tolerated. conclusion compared with taking zolpidem alone, the combination of zolpidem with shugan jieyu did not significantly improve insomnia, but showed preliminary non-objective signals in improving patients’ perception of falling asleep, particularly in patients with sleep fragmentation. trial registration the study is registered in the clinicaltrials.gov (nct05764798). date registered: 30 november 2022. peer review reports introduction insomnia is a prevalent sleep disorder characterized by difficulties in falling asleep or maintaining sleep, or premature or intermittent waking [ 1 ]. a significant clinical challenge is the frequent co-occurrence of insomnia with depressive symptoms, insomnia disorder with depressive symptoms (idds). the prevalence of insomnia is estimated at 10%–60% of the population [ 2 ]. insomnia is often accompanied by depressive symptoms. previous studies have revealed a bidirectional relationship between insomnia and depression, suggesting that insomnia is not just a consequence but also a predictor of depression [ 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 ]. current evidence demonstrates that approximately 66% of depressed patients experience comorbid insomnia [ 7 ], while 25% of insomnia patients develop depressive symptoms [ 4 , 8 ]. a 2024 large-scale chinese study ( n = 51,774) further quantified this overlap, showing insomnia patients had 11.3-fold higher odds of depression (95% ci: 9.58–13.29) compared to non-insomnia controls [ 9 ]. insomnia symptoms may persist even after remission in depression, which increases the risk of depression recurrence [ 6 ]. idds is a common condition in the clinical population and interventions for idds need to consider both insomnia and depressive symptoms that lead to improvement in insomnia and prevention of full-blown depression [ 10 , 11 ]. medications are increasingly used in clinical practice for the treatment of insomnia. zolpidem is a commonly used new generation of non-benzodiazepine sedatives for the treatment of insomnia [ 12 , 13 ]. however, clinical studies indicate that many patients with insomnia disorder and comorbid depressive symptoms (idds) continue to experience persistent depressive symptoms despite zolpidem treatment [ 6 ]. this is partly due to zolpidem’s limited efficacy in addressing the mood-related aspects of idds and its potential for tolerance and dependence with long-term use. additionally, the sedative effects of zolpidem can sometimes exacerbate the cognitive and emotional symptoms of depression [ 6 ]. antidepressants are widely prescribed for idds, with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (ssris)/serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (snris) (e.g., escitalopram) accounting for ~ 45% of prescriptions and sedating antidepressants (e.g., trazodone) for ~ 30%, despite limited food and drug administration (fda) approval for insomnia indications, reflecting real-world reliance on their dual mood-sleep effects [ 14 , 15 , 16 ]. according to everitt, some antidepressants improve sleep latency (sl) and may improve patients’ sleep fragmentation [ 17 ]. however, since depressive symptoms are not equivalent to depression, antidepressants are a bit extravagant when used to improve depressive symptoms. furthermore, antidepressants can cause undesirable side effects such as weight gain, sexual dysfunction, and sedation, and may lead to withdrawal symptoms upon discontinuation, which can deter long-term adherence [ 18 , 19 ]. this underscores the need for alternative therapies that can address both sleep and mood disturbances without such side effects. in addition, the use of antidepressants might have side effects and withdrawal reactions after discontinuation [ 20 , 21 ]. therefore, it is necessary to use a drug with high safety and effectiveness to improve depressive symptoms in insomnia. chinese medicine prescriptions have a long history in the treatment of depression, with significant curative effects and few adverse reactions [ 22 , 23 ]. shugan jieyu capsules, a chinese herbal medicine mainly composed of hypericum perforatum and acanthopanax senticosus , is a commonly used medication approved by the national medical products administration (nmpa) of the people’s republic of china to treat mild to moderate depression [ 24 ]. previous research provides a mechanistic rationale for the use of shugan jieyu capsules in treating insomnia, depression, and anxiety symptoms. animal studies have demonstrated that shugan jieyu reverses depression-like behaviors by enhancing phosphorylation levels in the medial prefrontal cortex and hippocampal ca3 region, as well as upregulating cyclic adenosine monophosphate response element-binding protein (creb) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (bdnf) expression [ 25 ]. clinical evidence supports these findings, with randomized controlled trials (rcts) showing that shugan jieyu capsules significantly improved insomnia, depression, and anxiety in various populations, including post-covid-19 convalescence patients [ 26 ]. additionally, zhang et al. (2014) conducted a systematic review confirming shugan jieyu capsules’ efficacy in major depressive disorder (mdd) which used data from 7 rcts highlighting its superior therapeutic effects and safety compared to placebo [ 27 ]. furthermore, combination therapy with venlafaxine has been shown to enhance depression remission rates compared to venlafaxine alone [ 27 ]. recent studies also indicate that shugan jieyu capsules can alleviate post-stroke depression-related cognitive impairment and emotional disturbances [ 28 ]. in addition, it has higher safety profiles for use in a combination regimen. therefore, shugan jieyu capsules can be considered in combination therapy to improve idds. in the current study, we conducted a double-blind, parallel-group randomized controlled trial to examine the efficacy of the combination of shugan jieyu capsules and zolpidem in idds. materials and methods participants and eligibility criteria patients with a diagnosis of idds were identified from the outpatient department. the participants were recruited in march 2023, and the last assessment was completed by october 2023. all of the subjects provided written informed consent, and the study was approved by nanfang hospital, southern medical university, china. the inclusion criteria for this study were as follows: 1. insomnia disorder, diagnosed using the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders, fifth edition (dsm-5) criteria; 2. depressive symptoms, defined as patient health questionnaire-9 (phq-9) score ≥ 10 points, but not fulfilling the dsm-5 criteria for major depressive disorder (mdd); 3. age 18–60 years; 4. no previous medication for insomnia or depression was used within the last month. the exclusion criteria were as follows: 5. allergy to specified substances, prior unsuccessful use of certain medications, recent use of specific medications affecting liver metabolism, substance or alcohol dependence, recent drug abuse, and medical conditions impacting drug metabolism; 6. recent participation in other drug studies; 7. chronic physical illness or mental disorders; 8. sleep apnea (apnea-hypopnea index [ahi] ≥ 15 events/hour) or periodic limb movement disorder (periodic limb movement index [plmi] > 15 events/hour) during baseline polysomnography; 9. night and shift workers; 10. pregnancy or lactation; 11. individuals with serious suicidal behavior or plans; 12. any other conditions deemed unsuitable for inclusion in the study. polysomnographic study nocturnal polysomnography (psg) assessments were conducted at baseline, 4 weeks, and 8 weeks. standard psg recordings included eeg (f4-m1, f3-m2, c4-m1, c3-m2, o2-m1, o1-m2), electrooculography (eog: le-a2, re-a1), submental electromyography (emg), bilateral anterior tibialis emg, electrocardiography (ecg), nasal airflow pressure, thoracic and abdominal respiratory effort sensors, pulse oximetry for oxygen saturation, breathing sound recording, and body position monitoring. all sleep parameters were determined through visual scoring of recordings according to established criteria. an experienced psg technologist, who remained blinded to the study protocol, performed quality control of all computerized sleep data. sleep staging, respiratory events, and periodic limb movements were analyzed in 30-second epochs following current aasm guidelines [ 29 ]. during baseline screening, participants exhibiting significant periodic limb movement disorder (plmi ≥ 15 events/hour) or obstructive sleep apnea (ahi ≥ 15 events/hour) were excluded from study participation. randomization and blinding in this study, block randomization was used. statisticians independent of the study used sas 9.4 to generate four-block randomization sequences. then, blinding managers, independent of the study, prepared boxes containing either shugan jieyu capsules or a placebo for 60 participants. the boxes were labeled with random numbers so that the researchers and the participants were blinded to the treatments. the researchers then distributed the capsules based on those numbers. study design the design entailed randomized (1:1), parallel-group, double-blind assignment of patients to shugan jieyu capsules in combination with zolpidem (the experimental group, zs group) or zolpidem in combination with placebo (the control group, zp group) for 8 weeks. the study design and reporting adheres to the consort guidelines. intervention in the zs group, the participants received shugan jieyu capsules (batch number: 220106, oral 0.72 g twice daily) in combination with zolpidem (batch number: 220201, oral 10 mg once daily) for 8 weeks. in the zp group, the participants received a placebo in combination with zolpidem (oral 10 mg once daily) for 8 weeks. shugan jieyu capsules and placebo (the main ingredient was inert starch) were completely consistent in sensory properties such as color, shape, smell, and taste. during the intervention period, other psychotropic drugs or any other related treatment within 8 weeks were not allowed. sample size calculation this study was a clinical trial with an 8-week duration, employing a 1:1 random allocation to the zs group and the zp group. since no prior data existed for the combination therapy, we conservatively estimated the effect size using published monotherapy results: shugan jieyu capsules can reduce insomnia severity index (isi) scores by − 11.2 [ 30 ], and zolpidem can reduce isi scores by − 6.8 [ 31 ]. assuming no synergistic effects, we projected an intergroup difference of 4.4 (11.2–6.8) with a standard deviation of 4.5. with a two-sided α of 0.05 and 85% power, each group required 23 subjects. considering a dropout rate of 20%, each group would need 30 subjects, resulting in a total estimated requirement of 60 subjects. outcome measures and measurements the primary outcome measure for the study was the change in isi score at week 8, which was determined as the reduction in isi score from baseline, providing a patient-reported outcome measure of insomnia severity [ 32 ]. the secondary outcome measures were as follows: 13. phq-9 to assess depressive symptoms [ 33 ], 14. generalized anxiety disorder 7 (gad-7) to assess anxiety symptoms [ 34 ], 15. epworth sleepiness scale (ess) to assess excessive daytime sleepiness [ 35 ], 16. the pittsburgh sleep quality index (psqi) to assess sleep quality [ 36 ], 17. quality of life enjoyment and satisfaction questionnaire-short form (q-les-q-sf) to assess the quality of life [ 37 ], 18. polysomnography (psg) parameters, including total sleep time (tst), sl, wake after sleep onset (waso), and sleep efficiency (se), for objective sleep evaluation [ 38 ], 19. sleep diary–extracted parameters, including subjective sl (ssl), subjective waso (swaso), subjective se (sse), and subjective tst (stst), for subjective sleep evaluation. all outcomes were evaluated from baseline to weeks 4 and 8. all adverse events that occurred or worsened between dosing day 1 and week 8 were recorded. statistical analysis descriptive statistics, including means and standard deviations for continuous variables and frequencies with percentages for categorical variables, were reported. results were reported in line with the consort guidelines [ 39 ]. primary efficacy analyses were conducted on a per-protocol evaluable population consisting of all randomized participants who: (1) received ≥ 1 dose of study medication, (2) completed baseline assessments, and (3) provided ≥ 1 post-baseline efficacy evaluation ( n = 59/60). one participant withdrew before any post-baseline assessments and was excluded from all analyses. two-tailed tests were used in all statistical analyses in sas (version 9.4), with p < 0.05 indicating statistical significance. mixed-model repeated-measures (mmrm) analysis on the final value of each measure (at baseline, week 4, and week 8), with group, baseline total score, time, and time × group interaction, was performed to assess the least squares means difference (lsmd) among the groups after 4 and 8 weeks of treatment. effect sizes (cohen’s d) were calculated for between-group comparisons (lsmd divided by pooled baseline standard deviation (sd)) and within-group changes (mean change divided by baseline sd), with interpretation thresholds of 0.2 (small), 0.5 (medium), and 0.8 (large). the analysis was applied to determine whether the overall course of change over the 8 weeks was different between the two groups. the mixed model is similar to ordinary least squares regression but has the advantage of using all the data. furthermore, a t- test was carried out to evaluate the difference between the groups at 4 weeks and 8 weeks. given that sleep fragmentation is a key feature of insomnia, a subgroup analysis was carried out in idds with sleep fragmentation. the analysis was an exploratory, non-prespecified analysis using the same analytical methods to investigate potential differential treatment effects in this clinically relevant subgroup. results participants a total of 60 patients were initially enrolled and randomly assigned to treatment. of these, one patient dropped out before receiving the minimum 4 weeks of treatment to qualify for the evaluable sample. the reason for dropping out was a change in medication requested by the patient. a total of 59 patients completed the requirements of the protocol. there were no significant differences in subject retention at the trial endpoint (week 8: zs, 30/30; zp, 29/30; χ 2 = 1.017, df = 1, p = 0.313). the study flow diagram is shown in fig. 1 . fig. 1 consolidated consort study flow diagram full size image table 1 provides descriptive statistics for baseline

found to have a waso score of at least 30 min. table 1 baseline demographic and clinical characteristics in the zs and zp groups full size table clinical scales, psg, and sleep diary outcomes between

(week 4: +5.9%, d = 0.57; week 8: +5.4%, d = 0.52). between-group differences were non-significant for all parameters (all p > 0.05), with effect sizes ranging from negligible to small (d = −0.12 to

table 5 . in both groups, a comparable proportion of patients reported adverse events throughout the trial, namely a total of 25 (86.2%) in the zp group and 23 (76.7%) in the zs group. all intervention-related aes were categorized as “possibly related” after investigator assessment and all reported aes were grade 1 (mild) in severity. drowsiness, dizziness, nausea and vomiting were the common side effects reported. there was no increase in side effects after combining shugan jieyu capsules with zolpidem. table 5 incidence of adverse events in the zs and zp groups full size table discussion the main finding of this study was that the combination of shugan jieyu capsules and zolpidem significantly decreased ssl in idds. for patients with sleep fragmentation, the combination regimen improved sse in addition to ssl. in psg, the combination regimen showed within-group improvement in tst and waso at 8 weeks. this study’s primary outcome, that is change in isi, showed no significant difference between zolpidem monotherapy and combination therapy with shugan jieyu. both groups showed significant improvements in insomnia severity (isi), sleep quality (psqi), excessive daytime sleepiness (ess), anxiety symptoms (gad-7), depressive symptoms (phq-9), and quality of life (q-les-q-sf). in this study, both subjective and objective sleep parameters were improved. however, the patients from the zs group reported a significant decrease in ssl, while objective sleep parameters did not reflect this change. this is in line with the well-documented phenomenon of subjective-objective sleep discrepancy in insomnia, where patient-reported sleep improvements often occur independently of changes in objective polysomnographic measures [ 40 , 41 ]. objective and subjective sleep measures often diverge in insomnia patients. previous research has shown that patients with insomnia often report their sleep characteristics as being more severe than indicated by objective measurements. as sleep improves, the patient’s perception of sleep also improves, significantly shortening the ssl. however, the first-night effect (fne) may influence objective results [ 42 , 43 ]. the quantitative criteria for insomnia define insomnia as occurring at least three nights per week. hence, one night of psg is likely to be insufficient to fully capture insomnia symptoms [ 44 , 45 ]. in addition, when our bodies try to enter a resting state in an unfamiliar environment, one hemisphere of the brain will be more alert than usual in psg. this is a balancing mechanism generated during sleep to guard against potential dangers [ 46 ]. previous studies have shown that zolpidem improves subjective and objective sleep [ 47 ], and current combination therapy significantly reduced ssl compared with zolpidem monotherapy. moreover, the zs group showed statistically significant within-group improvement in tst and waso at 8 weeks, which was not observed in the zp group. this indicates that the combination of shugan jieyu capsules and zolpidem may have the potential to improve subjective sleep quality and sleep continuity. the ssl finding, while potentially clinically relevant, requires cautious interpretation due to multiple comparisons and lack of objective corroboration. in addition, our study showed that in idds with sleep fragmentation, the combination of shugan jieyu capsules and zolpidem significantly reduced ssl and enhanced sse. these results suggest that individuals with more pronounced sleep fragmentation may benefit from a combination with shugan jieyu capsules, possibly due to the inhibitory effects of acanthopanax senticosus on serotonin synthesis and antioxidative stress damage, contributing to sedation and calming of nerves. this is consistent with a recent meta-analysis confirming that shugan jieyu capsule combination therapy significantly improves sleep quality in patients with insomnia [ 26 , 48 ]. futhermore, the combination of shugan jieyu capsules and non-benzodiazepine drugs improved the overall clinical effectiveness in patients with insomnia [ 48 ]. sleep fragmentation, characterized by frequent awakenings, is a hallmark of insomnia disorder and has been linked to heightened emotional dysregulation and depressive symptoms [ 6 , 49 ]. better se is associated with better subjectively perceived sleep quality [ 50 , 51 , 52 ]. this effect may be attributed to the complementary mechanisms of the two interventions: while zolpidem (a short-acting gabaergic hypnotic) primarily facilitates sleep initiation, shugan jieyu—through bioactive compounds (e.g., acanthopanax senticosus , hypericum perforatum ) —modulates monoaminergic neurotransmission (e.g., serotonin, bdnf) function [ 12 , 13 , 25 , 53 ], thereby enhancing sleep continuity and reducing fragmentation. in this study, we found that both groups showed significant improvements in isi, psqi, ess, gad-7, phq-9, and q-les-q-sf, without between-group differences. our findings highlight the efficacy of both treatments in reducing insomnia, excessive daytime sleepiness, anxiety symptoms, and depressive symptoms, while also enhancing sleep quality and overall quality of life (all p < 0.05 in each group), consistent with prior research. zolpidem improves subjective and objective insomnia symptoms by acting selectively on the central nervous system ω 1 receptor, producing strong sedative and hypnotic effects, with a mild reduction in anxiety and depressive symptoms [ 53 , 54 , 55 , 56 ]. in addition, a significant reduction in sl and waso may lead to a reduction in anxiety and worry at the beginning of sleep and waking up at midnight, thereby further improving anxiety and depressive symptoms [ 57 ]. moreover, due to the improvement in sleep, there might be a reduction in sleep-related anxiety and depressive symptoms by changing their perception of sleep [ 58 , 59 ]. however, some depressive symptoms may be secondary to poor sleep and, if sleep problems are addressed, depressive symptoms may improve [ 6 , 60 ]. those might be the reasons for the improvement of depressive and anxiety symptoms in both groups without between-group differences. zolpidem is a non-benzodiazepine hypnotic widely used in the treatment of insomnia. it functions by binding to the alpha-1 subunit of the γ-aminobutyric acid type a (gaba-a) receptor, exerting hypnotic effects through neuronal inhibition similar to benzodiazepines. clinical trial have demonstrated that zolpidem effectively reduces sleep latency by an average of 20 min and sustains these results in the long term [ 12 , 61 , 62 ]. it is available in various formulations, with immediate-release zolpidem being particularly effective at reducing sl and increasing tst. however, zolpidem has been associated with several adverse effects, including complex sleep-related behaviors like sleepwalking, hallucinations, increased suicidality, and even rare cases of committing homicide [ 12 , 63 ]. the shugan jieyu capsules are a herbal remedy primarily composed of extracts from hypericum perforatum (st. john’s wort) and acanthopanax senticosus . hypericum perforatum has been used for centuries as an antidepressant, functioning through mechanisms such as serotonin receptor modulation, monoamine oxidase inhibition, and neuroendocrine and ion channel modulation [ 53 ]. clinical studies have shown that it is significantly more effective than placebo and comparable to standard antidepressants such as fluoxetine and sertraline in treating depressive disorder [ 64 ]. the addition of acanthopanax senticosus may enhance the capsules’ effectiveness in improving sl and reducing oxidative stress, providing neuroprotection, and calming nerves [ 53 ]. zolpidem and shugan jieyu both offer unique benefits in treating insomnia, though through different mechanisms. zolpidem primarily focuses on improving sl and tst through its hypnotic effects, but carries risks of significant neuropsychiatric side effects [ 12 , 63 ]. in contrast, shugan jieyu , with its combination of hypericum perforatum and acanthopanax senticosus , provides both antidepressant and sedative effects with a more favorable side effect profile for those with depressive symptoms [ 53 ]. combining zolpidem with shugan jieyu may offer a superior treatment strategy for patients suffering from both insomnia and depressive symptoms. the rationale for this combination lies in the complementary effects of the two treatments: zolpidem provides immediate relief for sleep initiation [ 12 ], while shugan jieyu addresses the underlying mood dysregulation and improves sleep continuity [ 53 ], potentially leading to more sustained improvements. furthermore, our study’s safety results support this strategy, demonstrating that the combination was well-tolerated with no significant increase in adverse events compared to zolpidem monotherapy (table 5 ). this dual approach may not only improve sleep quality, but also address the underlying depression, which is often intertwined with insomnia [ 65 ]. while no significant between-group differences were observed in psg measures, the clinically meaningful improvements in ssl and sse with shugan jieyu supplementation are noteworthy. subjective sleep perception often diverges from objective metrics in insomnia, and patient-reported outcomes are critical determinants of treatment success [ 66 , 67 ]. the reduction in ssl and enhanced sse suggest that shugan jieyu may ameliorate the hyperarousal and cognitive distortions characteristic of insomnia disorder [ 68 ], particularly in patients with sleep fragmentation. however, the clinical relevance of this reduction remains uncertain, as the between-group effect sizes were small (cohen’s d = 0.23–0.25) and were not supported by objective psg measures. while patient-reported outcomes are valuable, a statistically significant but small improvement in ssl may not translate into a meaningful clinical benefit. these subjective improvements align with evidence that perceived sleep quality strongly influences daytime functioning and mood. thus, even in the absence of psg-detected changes [ 58 , 68 ], the alleviation of patient-reported distress may translate to better adherence, reduced depressive symptoms, and improved quality of life in managing insomnia with comorbid depressive features. furthermore, there is evidence suggesting that treating insomnia can lead to significant reductions in depressive severity, and these improvements are often maintained during follow-up [ 65 ]. therefore, the combination of zolpidem and shugan jieyu benefits from the antidepressant and sleep-enhancing properties of shugan jieyu . this multifaceted approach aligns well with the need for a multidisciplinary strategy in treating insomnia, particularly when comorbid with depressive symptoms [ 12 , 65 ]. limitations although our research has advantages, there are still some limitations that need to be considered. first, the relatively small sample sizes for each group may have reduced the statistical power to detect more significant group differences. second, the study was done in a single center. third, the intervention and follow-up periods in this study were relatively short. fourth, lack objective biomarker (e.g., serum bdnf) to correlate with clinical outcomes. short-term follow-up (8 weeks) precluded assessment of relapse rates. fifth, while we observed improvements in subjective sleep measures, the lack of objective psg concordance and multiple secondary analyses increase the risk of type i error. these findings should therefore be considered exploratory. future directions future studies should address the limitations of this study. specifically, longer intervention and follow-up periods are needed to assess the durability of the effects of zolpidem and shugan jieyu capsules in insomnia with comorbid depression. multi-center trials with larger, more diverse samples will improve the generalizability of the findings. additionally, research into the mechanisms of their synergistic effects, particularly through markers like bdnf and eeg sleep patterns, is warranted to better understand their molecular interactions. conclusions compared with taking zolpidem alone, the combination of zolpidem with shugan jieyu did not significantly improve insomnia, but showed preliminary non-objective signals in improving patients’ perception of falling asleep, particularly in patients with sleep fragmentation. data availability the data will be available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request. abbreviations aasm:

from depression. this study aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of combining zolpidem with shugan jieyu in treating idds. in a double-blind, randomized trial, 60 idds patients were assigned to zolpidem plus shugan jieyu (zs) or zolpidem plus placebo (zp) for 8 weeks, with 59 completing the study. assessments included the insomnia severity index (isi), patient health questionnaire-9 (phq-9), generalized anxiety disorder 7 (gad-7), pittsburgh sleep quality index (psqi), epworth sleepiness scale (ess), polysomnography (psg), and sleep diary. mixed-model repeated-measures (mmrm) analysis was performed to assess the least squares means difference (lsmd) among the groups after 4 and 8 weeks of treatment. subgroup analysis was performed on patients with sleep fragmentation (waso ≥ 30 min). both groups showed significant improvements in isi, psqi, ess, gad-7, and phq-9, with no between-group differences. for the primary outcome (isi), the between-group difference at week 8 was − 1.68 points (95% ci: -4.49 to 1.14; p = 0.238), corresponding to a small effect size (cohen’s d = 0.42). zs significantly reduced waso and increased tst at 8 weeks, whereas zp showed no significant changes in these measures within the group. zs reduced subjective sleep latency (ssl) significantly more than zp at weeks 4 (lsmd − 12.21 min, 95% ci -22.54 to -1.87; p = 0.021; d = 0.23) and 8 (lsmd − 12.17 min, 95% ci -21.99 to -2.35; p = 0.016; d = 0.25). in the sleep fragmentation subgroup, zs improved ssl and subjective sleep efficiency (sse). both treatments were well-tolerated. compared with taking zolpidem alone, the combination of zolpidem with shugan jieyu did not significantly improve insomnia, but showed preliminary non-objective signals in improving patients’ perception of falling asleep, particularly in patients with sleep fragmentation. the study is registered in the clinicaltrials.gov (nct05764798). date registered: 30 november

disorder characterized by difficulties in falling asleep or maintaining sleep, or premature or intermittent waking [ 1 ]. a significant clinical challenge is the frequent co-occurrence of insomnia with depressive symptoms, insomnia disorder with depressive symptoms (idds). the prevalence of insomnia is estimated at 10%–60% of the population [ 2 ]. insomnia is often accompanied by depressive symptoms. previous studies have revealed a bidirectional relationship between insomnia and depression, suggesting that insomnia is not just a consequence but also a predictor of depression [ 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 ]. current evidence demonstrates that approximately 66% of depressed patients experience comorbid insomnia [ 7 ], while 25% of insomnia patients develop depressive symptoms [ 4 , 8 ]. a 2024 large-scale chinese study ( n = 51,774) further quantified this overlap, showing insomnia patients had 11.3-fold higher odds of depression (95% ci: 9.58–13.29) compared to non-insomnia controls [ 9 ]. insomnia symptoms may persist even after remission in depression, which increases the risk of depression recurrence [ 6 ]. idds is a common condition in the clinical population and interventions for idds need to consider both insomnia and depressive symptoms that lead to improvement in insomnia and prevention of full-blown depression [ 10 , 11 ]. medications are increasingly used in clinical practice for the treatment of insomnia. zolpidem is a commonly used new generation of non-benzodiazepine sedatives for the treatment of insomnia [ 12 , 13 ]. however, clinical studies indicate that many patients with insomnia disorder and comorbid depressive symptoms (idds) continue to experience persistent depressive symptoms despite zolpidem treatment [ 6 ]. this is partly due to zolpidem’s limited efficacy in addressing the mood-related aspects of idds and its potential for tolerance and dependence with long-term use. additionally, the sedative effects of zolpidem can sometimes exacerbate the cognitive and emotional symptoms of depression [ 6 ]. antidepressants are widely prescribed for idds, with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (ssris)/serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (snris) (e.g., escitalopram) accounting for ~ 45% of prescriptions and sedating antidepressants (e.g., trazodone) for ~ 30%, despite limited food and drug administration (fda) approval for insomnia indications, reflecting real-world reliance on their dual mood-sleep effects [ 14 , 15 , 16 ]. according to everitt, some antidepressants improve sleep latency (sl) and may improve patients’ sleep fragmentation [ 17 ]. however, since depressive symptoms are not equivalent to depression, antidepressants are a bit extravagant when used to improve depressive symptoms. furthermore, antidepressants can cause undesirable side effects such as weight gain, sexual dysfunction, and sedation, and may lead to withdrawal symptoms upon discontinuation, which can deter long-term adherence [ 18 , 19 ]. this underscores the need for alternative therapies that can address both sleep and mood disturbances without such side effects. in addition, the use of antidepressants might have side effects and withdrawal reactions after discontinuation [ 20 , 21 ]. therefore, it is necessary to use a drug with high safety and effectiveness to improve depressive symptoms in insomnia. chinese medicine prescriptions have a long history in the treatment of depression, with significant curative effects and few adverse reactions [ 22 , 23 ]. shugan jieyu capsules, a chinese herbal medicine mainly composed of hypericum perforatum and acanthopanax senticosus , is a commonly used medication approved by the national medical products administration (nmpa) of the people’s republic of china to treat mild to moderate depression [ 24 ]. previous research provides a mechanistic rationale for the use of shugan jieyu capsules in treating insomnia, depression, and anxiety symptoms. animal studies have demonstrated that shugan jieyu reverses depression-like behaviors by enhancing phosphorylation levels in the medial prefrontal cortex and hippocampal ca3 region, as well as upregulating cyclic adenosine monophosphate response element-binding protein (creb) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (bdnf) expression [ 25 ]. clinical evidence supports these findings, with randomized controlled trials (rcts) showing that shugan jieyu capsules significantly improved insomnia, depression, and anxiety in various populations, including post-covid-19 convalescence patients [ 26 ]. additionally, zhang et al. (2014) conducted a systematic review confirming shugan jieyu capsules’ efficacy in major depressive disorder (mdd) which used data from 7 rcts highlighting its superior therapeutic effects and safety compared to placebo [ 27 ]. furthermore, combination therapy with venlafaxine has been shown to enhance depression remission rates compared to venlafaxine alone [ 27 ]. recent studies also indicate that shugan jieyu capsules can alleviate post-stroke depression-related cognitive impairment and emotional disturbances [ 28 ]. in addition, it has higher safety profiles for use in a combination regimen. therefore, shugan jieyu capsules can be considered in combination therapy to improve idds. in the current study, we conducted a double-blind, parallel-group randomized controlled trial to examine the efficacy of the combination of shugan jieyu capsules and zolpidem in idds. materials and methods participants and eligibility criteria patients with a diagnosis of idds were identified from the outpatient department. the participants were recruited in march 2023, and the last assessment was completed by october 2023. all of the subjects provided written informed consent, and the study was approved by nanfang hospital, southern medical university, china. the inclusion criteria for this study were as follows: 1. insomnia disorder, diagnosed using the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders, fifth edition (dsm-5) criteria; 2. depressive symptoms, defined as patient health questionnaire-9 (phq-9) score ≥ 10 points, but not fulfilling the dsm-5 criteria for major depressive disorder (mdd); 3. age 18–60 years; 4. no previous medication for insomnia or depression was used within the last month. the exclusion criteria were as follows: 5. allergy to specified substances, prior unsuccessful use of certain medications, recent use of specific medications affecting liver metabolism, substance or alcohol dependence, recent drug abuse, and medical conditions impacting drug metabolism; 6. recent participation in other drug studies; 7. chronic physical illness or mental disorders; 8. sleep apnea (apnea-hypopnea index [ahi] ≥ 15 events/hour) or periodic limb movement disorder (periodic limb movement index [plmi] > 15 events/hour) during baseline polysomnography; 9. night and shift workers; 10. pregnancy or lactation; 11. individuals with serious suicidal behavior or plans; 12. any other conditions deemed unsuitable for inclusion in the study. polysomnographic study nocturnal polysomnography (psg) assessments were conducted at baseline, 4 weeks, and 8 weeks. standard psg recordings included eeg (f4-m1, f3-m2, c4-m1, c3-m2, o2-m1, o1-m2), electrooculography (eog: le-a2, re-a1), submental electromyography (emg), bilateral anterior tibialis emg, electrocardiography (ecg), nasal airflow pressure, thoracic and abdominal respiratory effort sensors, pulse oximetry for oxygen saturation, breathing sound recording, and body position monitoring. all sleep parameters were determined through visual scoring of recordings according to established criteria. an experienced psg technologist, who remained blinded to the study protocol, performed quality control of all computerized sleep data. sleep staging, respiratory events, and periodic limb movements were analyzed in 30-second epochs following current aasm guidelines [ 29 ]. during baseline screening, participants exhibiting significant periodic limb movement disorder (plmi ≥ 15 events/hour) or obstructive sleep apnea (ahi ≥ 15 events/hour) were excluded from study participation. randomization and blinding in this study, block randomization was used. statisticians independent of the study used sas 9.4 to generate four-block randomization sequences. then, blinding managers, independent of the study, prepared boxes containing either shugan jieyu capsules or a placebo for 60 participants. the boxes were labeled with random numbers so that the researchers and the participants were blinded to the treatments. the researchers then distributed the capsules based on those numbers. study design the design entailed randomized (1:1), parallel-group, double-blind assignment of patients to shugan jieyu capsules in combination with zolpidem (the experimental group, zs group) or zolpidem in combination with placebo (the control group, zp group) for 8 weeks. the study design and reporting adheres to the consort guidelines. intervention in the zs group, the participants received shugan jieyu capsules (batch number: 220106, oral 0.72 g twice daily) in combination with zolpidem (batch number: 220201, oral 10 mg once daily) for 8 weeks. in the zp group, the participants received a placebo in combination with zolpidem (oral 10 mg once daily) for 8 weeks. shugan jieyu capsules and placebo (the main ingredient was inert starch) were completely consistent in sensory properties such as color, shape, smell, and taste. during the intervention period, other psychotropic drugs or any other related treatment within 8 weeks were not allowed. sample size calculation this study was a clinical trial with an 8-week duration, employing a 1:1 random allocation to the zs group and the zp group. since no prior data existed for the combination therapy, we conservatively estimated the effect size using published monotherapy results: shugan jieyu capsules can reduce insomnia severity index (isi) scores by − 11.2 [ 30 ], and zolpidem can reduce isi scores by − 6.8 [ 31 ]. assuming no synergistic effects, we projected an intergroup difference of 4.4 (11.2–6.8) with a standard deviation of 4.5. with a two-sided α of 0.05 and 85% power, each group required 23 subjects. considering a dropout rate of 20%, each group would need 30 subjects, resulting in a total estimated requirement of 60 subjects. outcome measures and measurements the primary outcome measure for the study was the change in isi score at week 8, which was determined as the reduction in isi score from baseline, providing a patient-reported outcome measure of insomnia severity [ 32 ]. the secondary outcome measures were as follows: 13. phq-9 to assess depressive symptoms [ 33 ], 14. generalized anxiety disorder 7 (gad-7) to assess anxiety symptoms [ 34 ], 15. epworth sleepiness scale (ess) to assess excessive daytime sleepiness [ 35 ], 16. the pittsburgh sleep quality index (psqi) to assess sleep quality [ 36 ], 17. quality of life enjoyment and satisfaction questionnaire-short form (q-les-q-sf) to assess the quality of life [ 37 ], 18. polysomnography (psg) parameters, including total sleep time (tst), sl, wake after sleep onset (waso), and sleep efficiency (se), for objective sleep evaluation [ 38 ], 19. sleep diary–extracted parameters, including subjective sl (ssl), subjective waso (swaso), subjective se (sse), and subjective tst (stst), for subjective sleep evaluation. all outcomes were evaluated from baseline to weeks 4 and 8. all adverse events that occurred or worsened between dosing day 1 and week 8 were recorded. statistical analysis descriptive statistics, including means and standard deviations for continuous variables and frequencies with percentages for categorical variables, were reported. results were reported in line with the consort guidelines [ 39 ]. primary efficacy analyses were conducted on a per-protocol evaluable population consisting of all randomized participants who: (1) received ≥ 1 dose of study medication, (2) completed baseline assessments, and (3) provided ≥ 1 post-baseline efficacy evaluation ( n = 59/60). one participant withdrew before any post-baseline assessments and was excluded from all analyses. two-tailed tests were used in all statistical analyses in sas (version 9.4), with p < 0.05 indicating statistical significance. mixed-model repeated-measures (mmrm) analysis on the final value of each measure (at baseline, week 4, and week 8), with group, baseline total score, time, and time × group interaction, was performed to assess the least squares means difference (lsmd) among the groups after 4 and 8 weeks of treatment. effect sizes (cohen’s d) were calculated for between-group comparisons (lsmd divided by pooled baseline standard deviation (sd)) and within-group changes (mean change divided by baseline sd), with interpretation thresholds of 0.2 (small), 0.5 (medium), and 0.8 (large). the analysis was applied to determine whether the overall course of change over the 8 weeks was different between the two groups. the mixed model is similar to ordinary least squares regression but has the advantage of using all the data. furthermore, a t- test was carried out to evaluate the difference between the groups at 4 weeks and 8 weeks. given that sleep fragmentation is a key feature of insomnia, a subgroup analysis was carried out in idds with sleep fragmentation. the analysis was an exploratory, non-prespecified analysis using the same analytical methods to investigate potential differential treatment effects in this clinically relevant subgroup. results participants a total of 60 patients were initially enrolled and randomly assigned to treatment. of these, one patient dropped out before receiving the minimum 4 weeks of treatment to qualify for the evaluable sample. the reason for dropping out was a change in medication requested by the patient. a total of 59 patients completed the requirements of the protocol. there were no significant differences in subject retention at the trial endpoint (week 8: zs, 30/30; zp, 29/30; χ 2 = 1.017, df = 1, p = 0.313). the study flow diagram is shown in fig. 1 . fig. 1 consolidated consort study flow diagram full size image table 1 provides descriptive statistics for baseline characteristics of the zs and zp groups. fifty-nine participants diagnosed with idds completed the trial, with a mean age of 27.5 ± 6.7 years. among them, 39.0% were male. a total of 48 (81.36%) were found to have a waso score of at least 30 min. table 1 baseline demographic and clinical characteristics in the zs and zp groups full size table clinical scales, psg, and sleep diary outcomes between

(week 4: +5.9%, d = 0.57; week 8: +5.4%, d = 0.52). between-group differences were non-significant for all parameters (all p > 0.05), with effect sizes ranging from negligible to small (d = −0.12 to

table 5 . in both groups, a comparable proportion of patients reported adverse events throughout the trial, namely a total of 25 (86.2%) in the zp group and 23 (76.7%) in the zs group. all intervention-related aes were categorized as “possibly related” after investigator assessment and all reported aes were grade 1 (mild) in severity. drowsiness, dizziness, nausea and vomiting were the common side effects reported. there was no increase in side effects after combining shugan jieyu capsules with zolpidem. table 5 incidence of adverse events in the zs and zp groups full size table discussion the main finding of this study was that the combination of shugan jieyu capsules and zolpidem significantly decreased ssl in idds. for patients with sleep fragmentation, the combination regimen improved sse in addition to ssl. in psg, the combination regimen showed within-group improvement in tst and waso at 8 weeks. this study’s primary outcome, that is change in isi, showed no significant difference between zolpidem monotherapy and combination therapy with shugan jieyu. both groups showed significant improvements in insomnia severity (isi), sleep quality (psqi), excessive daytime sleepiness (ess), anxiety symptoms (gad-7), depressive symptoms (phq-9), and quality of life (q-les-q-sf). in this study, both subjective and objective sleep parameters were improved. however, the patients from the zs group reported a significant decrease in ssl, while objective sleep parameters did not reflect this change. this is in line with the well-documented phenomenon of subjective-objective sleep discrepancy in insomnia, where patient-reported sleep improvements often occur independently of changes in objective polysomnographic measures [ 40 , 41 ]. objective and subjective sleep measures often diverge in insomnia patients. previous research has shown that patients with insomnia often report their sleep characteristics as being more severe than indicated by objective measurements. as sleep improves, the patient’s perception of sleep also improves, significantly shortening the ssl. however, the first-night effect (fne) may influence objective results [ 42 , 43 ]. the quantitative criteria for insomnia define insomnia as occurring at least three nights per week. hence, one night of psg is likely to be insufficient to fully capture insomnia symptoms [ 44 , 45 ]. in addition, when our bodies try to enter a resting state in an unfamiliar environment, one hemisphere of the brain will be more alert than usual in psg. this is a balancing mechanism generated during sleep to guard against potential dangers [ 46 ]. previous studies have shown that zolpidem improves subjective and objective sleep [ 47 ], and current combination therapy significantly reduced ssl compared with zolpidem monotherapy. moreover, the zs group showed statistically significant within-group improvement in tst and waso at 8 weeks, which was not observed in the zp group. this indicates that the combination of shugan jieyu capsules and zolpidem may have the potential to improve subjective sleep quality and sleep continuity. the ssl finding, while potentially clinically relevant, requires cautious interpretation due to multiple comparisons and lack of objective corroboration. in addition, our study showed that in idds with sleep fragmentation, the combination of shugan jieyu capsules and zolpidem significantly reduced ssl and enhanced sse. these results suggest that individuals with more pronounced sleep fragmentation may benefit from a combination with shugan jieyu capsules, possibly due to the inhibitory effects of acanthopanax senticosus on serotonin synthesis and antioxidative stress damage, contributing to sedation and calming of nerves. this is consistent with a recent meta-analysis confirming that shugan jieyu capsule combination therapy significantly improves sleep quality in patients with insomnia [ 26 , 48 ]. futhermore, the combination of shugan jieyu capsules and non-benzodiazepine drugs improved the overall clinical effectiveness in patients with insomnia [ 48 ]. sleep fragmentation, characterized by frequent awakenings, is a hallmark of insomnia disorder and has been linked to heightened emotional dysregulation and depressive symptoms [ 6 , 49 ]. better se is associated with better subjectively perceived sleep quality [ 50 , 51 , 52 ]. this effect may be attributed to the complementary mechanisms of the two interventions: while zolpidem (a short-acting gabaergic hypnotic) primarily facilitates sleep initiation, shugan jieyu—through bioactive compounds (e.g., acanthopanax senticosus , hypericum perforatum ) —modulates monoaminergic neurotransmission (e.g., serotonin, bdnf) function [ 12 , 13 , 25 , 53 ], thereby enhancing sleep continuity and reducing fragmentation. in this study, we found that both groups showed significant improvements in isi, psqi, ess, gad-7, phq-9, and q-les-q-sf, without between-group differences. our findings highlight the efficacy of both treatments in reducing insomnia, excessive daytime sleepiness, anxiety symptoms, and depressive symptoms, while also enhancing sleep quality and overall quality of life (all p < 0.05 in each group), consistent with prior research. zolpidem improves subjective and objective insomnia symptoms by acting selectively on the central nervous system ω 1 receptor, producing strong sedative and hypnotic effects, with a mild reduction in anxiety and depressive symptoms [ 53 , 54 , 55 , 56 ]. in addition, a significant reduction in sl and waso may lead to a reduction in anxiety and worry at the beginning of sleep and waking up at midnight, thereby further improving anxiety and depressive symptoms [ 57 ]. moreover, due to the improvement in sleep, there might be a reduction in sleep-related anxiety and depressive symptoms by changing their perception of sleep [ 58 , 59 ]. however, some depressive symptoms may be secondary to poor sleep and, if sleep problems are addressed, depressive symptoms may improve [ 6 , 60 ]. those might be the reasons for the improvement of depressive and anxiety symptoms in both groups without between-group differences. zolpidem is a non-benzodiazepine hypnotic widely used in the treatment of insomnia. it functions by binding to the alpha-1 subunit of the γ-aminobutyric acid type a (gaba-a) receptor, exerting hypnotic effects through neuronal inhibition similar to benzodiazepines. clinical trial have demonstrated that zolpidem effectively reduces sleep latency by an average of 20 min and sustains these results in the long term [ 12 , 61 , 62 ]. it is available in various formulations, with immediate-release zolpidem being particularly effective at reducing sl and increasing tst. however, zolpidem has been associated with several adverse effects, including complex sleep-related behaviors like sleepwalking, hallucinations, increased suicidality, and even rare cases of committing homicide [ 12 , 63 ]. the shugan jieyu capsules are a herbal remedy primarily composed of extracts from hypericum perforatum (st. john’s wort) and acanthopanax senticosus . hypericum perforatum has been used for centuries as an antidepressant, functioning through mechanisms such as serotonin receptor modulation, monoamine oxidase inhibition, and neuroendocrine and ion channel modulation [ 53 ]. clinical studies have shown that it is significantly more effective than placebo and comparable to standard antidepressants such as fluoxetine and sertraline in treating depressive disorder [ 64 ]. the addition of acanthopanax senticosus may enhance the capsules’ effectiveness in improving sl and reducing oxidative stress, providing neuroprotection, and calming nerves [ 53 ]. zolpidem and shugan jieyu both offer unique benefits in treating insomnia, though through different mechanisms. zolpidem primarily focuses on improving sl and tst through its hypnotic effects, but carries risks of significant neuropsychiatric side effects [ 12 , 63 ]. in contrast, shugan jieyu , with its combination of hypericum perforatum and acanthopanax senticosus , provides both antidepressant and sedative effects with a more favorable side effect profile for those with depressive symptoms [ 53 ]. combining zolpidem with shugan jieyu may offer a superior treatment strategy for patients suffering from both insomnia and depressive symptoms. the rationale for this combination lies in the complementary effects of the two treatments: zolpidem provides immediate relief for sleep initiation [ 12 ], while shugan jieyu addresses the underlying mood dysregulation and improves sleep continuity [ 53 ], potentially leading to more sustained improvements. furthermore, our study’s safety results support this strategy, demonstrating that the combination was well-tolerated with no significant increase in adverse events compared to zolpidem monotherapy (table 5 ). this dual approach may not only improve sleep quality, but also address the underlying depression, which is often intertwined with insomnia [ 65 ]. while no significant between-group differences were observed in psg measures, the clinically meaningful improvements in ssl and sse with shugan jieyu supplementation are noteworthy. subjective sleep perception often diverges from objective metrics in insomnia, and patient-reported outcomes are critical determinants of treatment success [ 66 , 67 ]. the reduction in ssl and enhanced sse suggest that shugan jieyu may ameliorate the hyperarousal and cognitive distortions characteristic of insomnia disorder [ 68 ], particularly in patients with sleep fragmentation. however, the clinical relevance of this reduction remains uncertain, as the between-group effect sizes were small (cohen’s d = 0.23–0.25) and were not supported by objective psg measures. while patient-reported outcomes are valuable, a statistically significant but small improvement in ssl may not translate into a meaningful clinical benefit. these subjective improvements align with evidence that perceived sleep quality strongly influences daytime functioning and mood. thus, even in the absence of psg-detected changes [ 58 , 68 ], the alleviation of patient-reported distress may translate to better adherence, reduced depressive symptoms, and improved quality of life in managing insomnia with comorbid depressive features. furthermore, there is evidence suggesting that treating insomnia can lead to significant reductions in depressive severity, and these improvements are often maintained during follow-up [ 65 ]. therefore, the combination of zolpidem and shugan jieyu benefits from the antidepressant and sleep-enhancing properties of shugan jieyu . this multifaceted approach aligns well with the need for a multidisciplinary strategy in treating insomnia, particularly when comorbid with depressive symptoms [ 12 , 65 ]. limitations although our research has advantages, there are still some limitations that need to be considered. first, the relatively small sample sizes for each group may have reduced the statistical power to detect more significant group differences. second, the study was done in a single center. third, the intervention and follow-up periods in this study were relatively short. fourth, lack objective biomarker (e.g., serum bdnf) to correlate with clinical outcomes. short-term follow-up (8 weeks) precluded assessment of relapse rates. fifth, while we observed improvements in subjective sleep measures, the lack of objective psg concordance and multiple secondary analyses increase the risk of type i error. these findings should therefore be considered exploratory. future directions future studies should address the limitations of this study. specifically, longer intervention and follow-up periods are needed to assess the durability of the effects of zolpidem and shugan jieyu capsules in insomnia with comorbid depression. multi-center trials with larger, more diverse samples will improve the generalizability of the findings. additionally, research into the mechanisms of their synergistic effects, particularly through markers like bdnf and eeg sleep patterns, is warranted to better understand their molecular interactions. conclusions compared with taking zolpidem alone, the combination of zolpidem with shugan jieyu did not significantly improve insomnia, but showed preliminary non-objective signals in improving patients’ perception of falling asleep, particularly in patients with sleep fragmentation. data availability the data will be available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request. abbreviations aasm:

.## Discussion
the main finding of this study was that the combination of shugan jieyu capsules and zolpidem significantly decreased ssl in idds. for patients with sleep fragmentation, the combination regimen improved sse in addition to ssl. in psg, the combination regimen showed within-group improvement in tst and waso at 8 weeks. this study’s primary outcome, that is change in isi, showed no significant difference between zolpidem monotherapy and combination therapy with shugan jieyu. both groups showed significant improvements in insomnia severity (isi), sleep quality (psqi), excessive daytime sleepiness (ess), anxiety symptoms (gad-7), depressive symptoms (phq-9), and quality of life (q-les-q-sf). in this study, both subjective and objective sleep parameters were improved. however, the patients from the zs group reported a significant decrease in ssl, while objective sleep parameters did not reflect this change. this is in line with the well-documented phenomenon of subjective-objective sleep discrepancy in insomnia, where patient-reported sleep improvements often occur independently of changes in objective polysomnographic measures [ 40 , 41 ]. objective and subjective sleep measures often diverge in insomnia patients. previous research has shown that patients with insomnia often report their sleep characteristics as being more severe than indicated by objective measurements. as sleep improves, the patient’s perception of sleep also improves, significantly shortening the ssl. however, the first-night effect (fne) may influence objective results [ 42 , 43 ]. the quantitative criteria for insomnia define insomnia as occurring at least three nights per week. hence, one night of psg is likely to be insufficient to fully capture insomnia symptoms [ 44 , 45 ]. in addition, when our bodies try to enter a resting state in an unfamiliar environment, one hemisphere of the brain will be more alert than usual in psg. this is a balancing mechanism generated during sleep to guard against potential dangers [ 46 ]. previous studies have shown that zolpidem improves subjective and objective sleep [ 47 ], and current combination therapy significantly reduced ssl compared with zolpidem monotherapy. moreover, the zs group showed statistically significant within-group improvement in tst and waso at 8 weeks, which was not observed in the zp group. this indicates that the combination of shugan jieyu capsules and zolpidem may have the potential to improve subjective sleep quality and sleep continuity. the ssl finding, while potentially clinically relevant, requires cautious interpretation due to multiple comparisons and lack of objective corroboration. in addition, our study showed that in idds with sleep fragmentation, the combination of shugan jieyu capsules and zolpidem significantly reduced ssl and enhanced sse. these results suggest that individuals with more pronounced sleep fragmentation may benefit from a combination with shugan jieyu capsules, possibly due to the inhibitory effects of acanthopanax senticosus on serotonin synthesis and antioxidative stress damage, contributing to sedation and calming of nerves. this is consistent with a recent meta-analysis confirming that shugan jieyu capsule combination therapy significantly improves sleep quality in patients with insomnia [ 26 , 48 ]. futhermore, the combination of shugan jieyu capsules and non-benzodiazepine drugs improved the overall clinical effectiveness in patients with insomnia [ 48 ]. sleep fragmentation, characterized by frequent awakenings, is a hallmark of insomnia disorder and has been linked to heightened emotional dysregulation and depressive symptoms [ 6 , 49 ]. better se is associated with better subjectively perceived sleep quality [ 50 , 51 , 52 ]. this effect may be attributed to the complementary mechanisms of the two interventions: while zolpidem (a short-acting gabaergic hypnotic) primarily facilitates sleep initiation, shugan jieyu—through bioactive compounds (e.g., acanthopanax senticosus , hypericum perforatum ) —modulates monoaminergic neurotransmission (e.g., serotonin, bdnf) function [ 12 , 13 , 25 , 53 ], thereby enhancing sleep continuity and reducing fragmentation. in this study, we found that both groups showed significant improvements in isi, psqi, ess, gad-7, phq-9, and q-les-q-sf, without between-group differences. our findings highlight the efficacy of both treatments in reducing insomnia, excessive daytime sleepiness, anxiety symptoms, and depressive symptoms, while also enhancing sleep quality and overall quality of life (all p < 0.05 in each group), consistent with prior research. zolpidem improves subjective and objective insomnia symptoms by acting selectively on the central nervous system ω 1 receptor, producing strong sedative and hypnotic effects, with a mild reduction in anxiety and depressive symptoms [ 53 , 54 , 55 , 56 ]. in addition, a significant reduction in sl and waso may lead to a reduction in anxiety and worry at the beginning of sleep and waking up at midnight, thereby further improving anxiety and depressive symptoms [ 57 ]. moreover, due to the improvement in sleep, there might be a reduction in sleep-related anxiety and depressive symptoms by changing their perception of sleep [ 58 , 59 ]. however, some depressive symptoms may be secondary to poor sleep and, if sleep problems are addressed, depressive symptoms may improve [ 6 , 60 ]. those might be the reasons for the improvement of depressive and anxiety symptoms in both groups without between-group differences. zolpidem is a non-benzodiazepine hypnotic widely used in the treatment of insomnia. it functions by binding to the alpha-1 subunit of the γ-aminobutyric acid type a (gaba-a) receptor, exerting hypnotic effects through neuronal inhibition similar to benzodiazepines. clinical trial have demonstrated that zolpidem effectively reduces sleep latency by an average of 20 min and sustains these results in the long term [ 12 , 61 , 62 ]. it is available in various formulations, with immediate-release zolpidem being particularly effective at reducing sl and increasing tst. however, zolpidem has been associated with several adverse effects, including complex sleep-related behaviors like sleepwalking, hallucinations, increased suicidality, and even rare cases of committing homicide [ 12 , 63 ]. the shugan jieyu capsules are a herbal remedy primarily composed of extracts from hypericum perforatum (st. john’s wort) and acanthopanax senticosus . hypericum perforatum has been used for centuries as an antidepressant, functioning through mechanisms such as serotonin receptor modulation, monoamine oxidase inhibition, and neuroendocrine and ion channel modulation [ 53 ]. clinical studies have shown that it is significantly more effective than placebo and comparable to standard antidepressants such as fluoxetine and sertraline in treating depressive disorder [ 64 ]. the addition of acanthopanax senticosus may enhance the capsules’ effectiveness in improving sl and reducing oxidative stress, providing neuroprotection, and calming nerves [ 53 ]. zolpidem and shugan jieyu both offer unique benefits in treating insomnia, though through different mechanisms. zolpidem primarily focuses on improving sl and tst through its hypnotic effects, but carries risks of significant neuropsychiatric side effects [ 12 , 63 ]. in contrast, shugan jieyu , with its combination of hypericum perforatum and acanthopanax senticosus , provides both antidepressant and sedative effects with a more favorable side effect profile for those with depressive symptoms [ 53 ]. combining zolpidem with shugan jieyu may offer a superior treatment strategy for patients suffering from both insomnia and depressive symptoms. the rationale for this combination lies in the complementary effects of the two treatments: zolpidem provides immediate relief for sleep initiation [ 12 ], while shugan jieyu addresses the underlying mood dysregulation and improves sleep continuity [ 53 ], potentially leading to more sustained improvements. furthermore, our study’s safety results support this strategy, demonstrating that the combination was well-tolerated with no significant increase in adverse events compared to zolpidem monotherapy (table 5 ). this dual approach may not only improve sleep quality, but also address the underlying depression, which is often intertwined with insomnia [ 65 ]. while no significant between-group differences were observed in psg measures, the clinically meaningful improvements in ssl and sse with shugan jieyu supplementation are noteworthy. subjective sleep perception often diverges from objective metrics in insomnia, and patient-reported outcomes are critical determinants of treatment success [ 66 , 67 ]. the reduction in ssl and enhanced sse suggest that shugan jieyu may ameliorate the hyperarousal and cognitive distortions characteristic of insomnia disorder [ 68 ], particularly in patients with sleep fragmentation. however, the clinical relevance of this reduction remains uncertain, as the between-group effect sizes were small (cohen’s d = 0.23–0.25) and were not supported by objective psg measures. while patient-reported outcomes are valuable, a statistically significant but small improvement in ssl may not translate into a meaningful clinical benefit. these subjective improvements align with evidence that perceived sleep quality strongly influences daytime functioning and mood. thus, even in the absence of psg-detected changes [ 58 , 68 ], the alleviation of patient-reported distress may translate to better adherence, reduced depressive symptoms, and improved quality of life in managing insomnia with comorbid depressive features. furthermore, there is evidence suggesting that treating insomnia can lead to significant reductions in depressive severity, and these improvements are often maintained during follow-up [ 65 ]. therefore, the combination of zolpidem and shugan jieyu benefits from the antidepressant and sleep-enhancing properties of shugan jieyu . this multifaceted approach aligns well with the need for a multidisciplinary strategy in treating insomnia, particularly when comorbid with depressive symptoms [ 12 , 65 ]. limitations although our research has advantages, there are still some limitations that need to be considered. first, the relatively small sample sizes for each group may have reduced the statistical power to detect more significant group differences. second, the study was done in a single center. third, the intervention and follow-up periods in this study were relatively short. fourth, lack objective biomarker (e.g., serum bdnf) to correlate with clinical outcomes. short-term follow-up (8 weeks) precluded assessment of relapse rates. fifth, while we observed improvements in subjective sleep measures, the lack of objective psg concordance and multiple secondary analyses increase the risk of type i error. these findings should therefore be considered exploratory. future directions future studies should address the limitations of this study. specifically, longer intervention and follow-up periods are needed to assess the durability of the effects of zolpidem and shugan jieyu capsules in insomnia with comorbid depression. multi-center trials with larger, more diverse samples will improve the generalizability of the findings. additionally, research into the mechanisms of their synergistic effects, particularly through markers like bdnf and eeg sleep patterns, is warranted to better understand their molecular interactions. conclusions compared with taking zolpidem alone, the combination of zolpidem with shugan jieyu did not significantly improve insomnia, but showed preliminary non-objective signals in improving patients’ perception of falling asleep, particularly in patients with sleep fragmentation. data availability the data will be available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request. abbreviations aasm:
