## Abstract
Caffeine is a commonly used stimulant of the central nervous system that reduces fatigue, increases alertness, and exerts positive effects on emotion through actions on various brain structures. High doses of caffeine can cause headaches, heart palpitations, hyperactivity, and anxiety symptoms. Consequently, reducing the consumption of stimulant substances, such as sugar and caffeine, is proposed to ameliorate symptoms of premenstrual syndrome in women. The administration of steroid hormones has been suggested to modulate the effects of caffeine, but unknown is whether endogenous hormone variations during the estrous cycle modulate the pharmacological effects of caffeine. The present study evaluated the effects of caffeine (10, 20, and 40 mg/kg) during metestrus-diestrus and proestrus-estrus of the ovarian cycle in rats on anxiety-like behavior using the elevated plus maze and light/dark box. During metestrus-diestrus, all doses of caffeine increased anxiety-like behavior, indicated by the main variables in both behavioral tests (i.e., higher Anxiety Index and lower percent time spent on the open arms in the elevated plus maze and less time spent in the light compartment in the light/dark box). During proestrus-estrus, only 20 and 40 mg/kg caffeine increased these parameters of anxiety-like behavior, albeit only slightly. In conclusion, caffeine increased anxiety-like behaviors in metestrus-diestrus, with an attenuation of these effects of lower doses of caffeine in proestrus-estrus. These effects that were observed in metestrus-diestrus and proestrus-estrus may be associated with low and high concentrations of steroid hormones, respectively, that naturally occur during these phases of the ovarian cycle.
