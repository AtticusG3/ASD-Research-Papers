## Abstract
To develop an HPLC-ECD for the determination of monoamine transmitters in serum of macaque. The analysis was carried out on a ZORBAX SB-C18 column (4.6 mm x 250 mm, 5 microm) eluted with a mobile phase of methanol-water (18:82) at a flow rate of 0.9 mL x min(-1). The recoveries of NE, E, DA, 5-HT were 97.0%, 97.8%, 99.5%, 100.3%, RSD was 0.22%-0.93%, and the repeatability was good. The results prove that the method is simple, fast, accurate and can be used to determine simultaneously the concentration of monoamine transmitters in serum of macaque.
