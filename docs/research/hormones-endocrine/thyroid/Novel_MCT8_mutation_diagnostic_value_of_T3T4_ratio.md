## Abstract

To highlight the diagnostic value of the T3/T4 ratio in We report a 36-month-old boy with severe neurodevelopmental delay and axial hypotonia. Initial thyroid function tests at 10 months showed TSH at 4.77 Î¼IU/mL and T3 at 8.9 pmol/L. Brain MRI was normal. At 28 months, genetic analysis identified a novel hemizygous c.1343_1344dup mutation in the This case highlights the diagnostic value of the T3/T4 ratio (>0.75 pmol/pmol) as an essential biochemical marker of AHDS in any male infant presenting with unexplained developmental delay and hypotonia. A systematic diagnostic approach including early T3 measurement and T3/T4 ratio calculation should be applied in the initial evaluation of severe developmental delays, even in the presence of normal brain MRI findings, to avoid diagnostic delays in AHDS.
