## Abstract

It has been evidenced that chlorinated polyfluoroalkyl ether sulfonic acids (Cl-PFESAs) have strong potential cross the placental barrier, but their adverse effects on offspring remain unclear. In this study, pregnant mice received daily intraperitoneal injections of chlorinated polyfluorinated ether sulfonate (Cl-PFESA; commercially known as F-53B, primarily comprising 6:2 Cl-PFESA and 8:2 Cl-PFESA) at dosages of 40 and 200 μg/kg from gestational days 6 to 17. Following gestational exposure, distinct accumulation of 6:2 and 8:2 Cl-PFESAs was observed in both the placenta and fetal brain, confirming their penetration across the placental and fetal blood-brain barriers. Maternal exposure to F-53B disrupted the placental 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 (
