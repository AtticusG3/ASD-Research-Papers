## Abstract

This prospective cohort study investigated the impact of maternal exposure to endocrine-disrupting chemicals, specifically phthalates and bisphenol A (BPA), on infant neurodevelopment. From 2019 to 2022, 672 pregnant women consented to participate in the study during their initial prenatal appointments at the Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinic of King Faisal Specialist Hospital & Research Centre. Two urine samples were collected each trimester to measure seven phthalate metabolites and BPA levels. Neurodevelopmental performance was evaluated using the Ages & Stages Questionnaires® Third Edition at 6, 12, and 18 months of age, and the risk of autism was assessed with the Modified Checklist For Autism in Toddlers at 18 months. Linear mixed models and logistic regression were applied to evaluate trimester-specific and overall associations using natural log-transformed urinary concentrations of phthalates and BPA. Our results showed that each one-unit increase in the log-transformed concentration of specific phthalates and BPA was associated with significant changes in infant developmental scores. During the first trimester, elevated levels of mono-n-butyl phthalate (MnBP), mono-iso-butyl phthalate (MiBP), and BPA were associated with 4.3 %-5.6 % decreases in gross motor (GM) scores. In contrast, monoethyl phthalate (MEP) and low-molecular-weight (∑LMW) phthalates were linked to 4 %-4.5 % increases in communication (COMM) scores. In the third trimester, MECPP and Σ
