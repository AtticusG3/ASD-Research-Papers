## Abstract

Neonatal severe hyperparathyroidism (NSHPT) is a rare condition characterized by inactivating mutations in the calcium-sensing receptor ( We present a case of a six-day-old male infant with weakness, jaundice, and hypotonia, later diagnosed with NSHPT due to a known homozygous This case underscores the importance of early diagnosis and intervention in NSHPT and highlights the critical role of medical treatment, surgical management and long-term follow-up in optimising patient outcomes. Continued research is essential to enhance understanding and treatment strategies for NSHPT.
