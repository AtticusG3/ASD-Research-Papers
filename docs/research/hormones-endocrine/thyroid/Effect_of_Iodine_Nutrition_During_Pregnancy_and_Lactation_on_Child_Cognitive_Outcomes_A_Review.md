## Abstract

Iodine deficiency remains one of the most serious global public health challenges, recognised as the leading cause of preventable brain damage worldwide. It is widely accepted as the primary aetiological factor underlying iodine deficiency disorders (IDD). Inadequate maternal iodine intake reduces thyroxine synthesis, impairing foetal brain development and leading to long-term deficits in cognitive function across childhood and adulthood. However, emerging evidence also suggests that excessive iodine intake may disrupt thyroid function, particularly in individuals with underlying thyroid autoimmunity, potentially leading to adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes. In this state-of-the-art review, we examine the effects of iodine nutrition during pregnancy and lactation on child cognitive outcomes. We provide an overview of the recent global iodine status, critically appraise the current evidence linking both iodine deficiency and excess to neurodevelopmental outcomes, and offer expert interpretation of the key findings. We further highlight areas of uncertainty, introduce emerging evidence from contemporary studies, and propose directions for future research to inform and optimise public health policies and clinical practice. Our findings highlight a U-shaped association, whereby both insufficient and excessive iodine exposure during pregnancy and lactation may impair optimal brain development in the offspring.
