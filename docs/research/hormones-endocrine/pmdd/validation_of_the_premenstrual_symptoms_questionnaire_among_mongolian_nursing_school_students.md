## Abstract
Premenstrual disorders (PMDs) significantly affect the daily lives of women. This study evaluated the reliability and validity of the Mongolian-translated Premenstrual Symptoms Questionnaire (PSQ) among female nursing students at the Mongolian National University of Medical Sciences. This cross-sectional study was conducted from February 2023 to January 2024. The PSQ was translated into Mongolian, and its reliability and validity were assessed. A total of 431 participants completed the translated PSQ along with the Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder (PMDD) Scale, Somatic Symptom Scale (SSS-8), Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), and Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI). Reliability was evaluated via Cronbach's alpha for internal consistency. Validity was assessed via factor analysis and correlations with external measures. The internal consistency of the Mongolian PSQ was 0. 945. Factor analysis supported the tool's construct validity, which revealed a one-factor structure consistent with that of the original Japanese PSQ. The PSQ had strong positive correlations with the PMDD Scale (r = 0.760), SSS-8 (r = 0.640), PHQ-9 (r = 0.580), and BAI (r = 0.620), which indicated good convergent validity. The Mongolian-translated PSQ is a reliable and valid tool for assessing premenstrual symptoms in female nursing students. These findings suggest that the PSQ is a useful tool for screening PMDs in this population.
