## Abstract
The prevalence of premenstrual discomfort among Spanish women is very high, and has a negative impact on their quality of life. By adopting the biopsychosocial approach, this study aims to understand women's experiences and insights, delve further into their beliefs and attitudes towards premenstrual syndrome and menstrual suppression, and to identify their proposals in order to adapt healthcare professionals' response to their needs and demands. A qualitative study was conducted based on individual in-depth interviews with 16 women located in the Granada region. Purposive sampling was made using theoretical profiles. Informed consent was given. The study included data assessment, investigator triangulation, and a literature review. Premenstrual discomfort has an impact on physical and psychological health, disrupting daily lives and resulting in self-medication. Healthcare is considered deficient, since remedies are limited to medicalisation, but the source of the discomfort is not investigated. Different beliefs about the premenstrual syndrome (PMS) were found: PMS is inherent to menstrual cycle and cannot be avoided; PMS is the result of endogenous factors (such as genetics, defects or biochemical and hormonal disorders); exogenous factors (such as stress, eating habits, or exercise); the science and industry describe and treat PMS as a disease. Menstrual suppression is considered an option by women with children, though there is reticence due to the side effects found. Health education programmes for women are proposed, as well as the appropriate training for health professionals in order to overcome the pharmacological approach. The biopsychosocial approach helps to determine the perspective of the women, their needs and expectations in order to provide better healthcare services to premenstrual discomfort patients.
