## Abstract
Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) affects approximately 48% of women of reproductive age worldwide. It can lead to functional impairment, lower quality of life, and decreased work productivity. Despite the availability of medical treatment options, women are seeking alternative interventions because of concerns of harmful side effects and limited evidence of efficacy associated with pharmacological treatments. To date, high-quality research investigating the effects of dietary and nutrient intervention on PMS is limited. This systematic review investigated the effect of nutritional interventions on the psychological symptoms of PMS. Five electronic databases were searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published in English from inception to October 2022. Trials eligible for inclusion were nutritional intervention studies involving women of reproductive age that measured PMS-associated psychological outcomes. Articles were selected using prespecified inclusion criteria. Data screening and extraction and risk-of-bias assessments were conducted by 3 independent reviewers using article screening software and the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2 tool. Thirty-two articles reporting on 31 RCTs involving 3254 participants, ranging in age from 15 to 50 years were included and narratively reviewed. Only 1 of the included studies had a low risk of bias. Treatment with vitamin B6, calcium, and zinc consistently had significant positive effects on the psychological symptoms of PMS. There was insufficient evidence to support the effects of vitamin B1, vitamin D, whole-grain carbohydrates, soy isoflavones, dietary fatty acids, magnesium, multivitamin supplementation, or PMS-specific diets. There is some evidence to support the use of nutritional interventions for improving psychological symptoms of PMS. However, more research using consistent protocols, procedures to minimize risk of bias, intention-to-treat analysis, and clearer reporting is required to provide conclusive nutritional recommendations for improving PMS-related psychological outcomes.
