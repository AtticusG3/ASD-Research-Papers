## Abstract
Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) and premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) affect many reproductive-aged women and can significantly impact their quality of life, including academic performance, relationships, and mental health, perhaps even leading to suicidal behavior. However, there was no validated, robust, and psychometrically sound instrument to screen for symptoms in the Bangladeshi context. This study aimed to translate and adapt a widely used instrument, the Premenstrual Symptoms Screening Tool (PSST) in the Bangladeshi context, and to assess the prevalence of PMS and PMDD among adolescent girls in Bangladesh. A cross-sectional study was conducted among 939 adolescent girls in Bangladesh aged 11-19 years using the "Konnect" platform of a2i between April to October 2022. Data were collected through a pre-tested semi-structured questionnaire that included informed consent, socio-demographic information, menstrual history, the Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale 21 (DASS-21), and the PSST scale. Statistical analysis, including descriptive statistics and confirmatory factor analysis, was performed using IBM SPSS Statistics (version 25.0) and IBM SPSS Amos (version 26.0). Convergent validity was assessed by correlating the Bangla version of the PSST with depression, anxiety, and stress subscales of the DASS-21. The prevalence estimates of moderate to severe PMS and PMDD were 33.16%, and 19.05%, respectively. Item-level analysis showed that the measurement items were normally distributed which suggested measurement of the same construct. The Bangla version of the PSST demonstrated excellent internal consistency (Cronbach alpha = 0.96) and convergent validity. The total PSST score was positively and significantly correlated with depression (r = 0.54), anxiety (r = 0.50), and stress (r = 0.50), suggesting convergent validity. The scale-level psychometric properties were satisfactory, indicating an excellent fit to the data and supporting convergent validity. The Bangla version of the PSST was found to be a valid screening tool for assessing PMS in women in Bangladesh. It will help to identify and address their healthcare needs, promote well-being, and advance further research in the Bangladeshi context.
