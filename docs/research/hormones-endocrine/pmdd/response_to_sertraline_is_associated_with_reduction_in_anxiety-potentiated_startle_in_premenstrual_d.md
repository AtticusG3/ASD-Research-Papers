## Abstract
Women with premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) appear to have altered central nervous system sensitivity to neuroactive steroid hormones, manifesting as affective symptoms and heightened arousal in the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle. In particular, women with PMDD appear less sensitive to allopregnanolone, a positive allosteric GABA-A receptor (GABA-A-R) modulator. This study evaluated psychophysiologic reactivity in women with PMDD in the follicular and luteal phases of the menstrual cycle, utilizing anxiety-potentiated startle (APS), a potential translational marker of GABA-A-R sensitivity. The study also assessed APS response to low-dose sertraline treatment in women with PMDD. Participants' APS and fear-potentiated startle (FPS) were assessed in the follicular and luteal phases. Women with PMDD received 50 mg sertraline in the following luteal phase to examine impact on APS and FPS. There were no significant differences between controls (n = 41) and PMDD participants (n = 36) in change from follicular to luteal phases in baseline startle, APS nor FPS. However, among participants who responded to sertraline, APS was higher in the untreated luteal phase than the follicular phase, but lower in the treated luteal phase than the follicular phase. These data demonstrate elevated psychophysiologic arousal in the luteal phase among some women with PMDD, suggesting impaired ability to modulate arousal reactivity. Specifically, alterations in APS suggest potential GABA-A-R changes across the menstrual cycle and in response to sertraline among treatment responders.
