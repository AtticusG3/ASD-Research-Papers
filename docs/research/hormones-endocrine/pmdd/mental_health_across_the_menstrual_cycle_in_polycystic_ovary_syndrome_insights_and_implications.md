## Abstract
We reviewed a wide body of emerging research highlighting the possibility for premenstrual exacerbations of mood symptoms in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Neuroendocrine dysregulation, sensitivity to ovarian hormone fluctuations as well as higher levels and types of adverse childhood experiences and demographic factors are emerging factors explaining high rates of psychiatric disorders in PCOS. Ovulatory dysfunction, common in PCOS, significantly interferes with one's identity and quality of life. Results on pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic treatments for mood symptoms are mixed, though improvements in the physical sequalae of PCOS could also improve mood symptoms. However, significant improvements on the methodological quality are needed, particularly the evaluation of mood symptoms across the menstrual cycle. Evidence is preliminary on whether there are premenstrual exacerbations of psychiatric symptoms in PCOS. Prospective, longitudinal studies with larger sample sizes are needed to comprehensively understand the psychiatric profile in PCOS.
