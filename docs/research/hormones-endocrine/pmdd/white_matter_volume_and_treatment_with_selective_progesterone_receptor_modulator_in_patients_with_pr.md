## Abstract
Premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) is a mood disorder for which selective progesterone receptor modulator (SPRM) treatment has been demonstrated to be beneficial. The neural signatures of this treatment have been so far identified as greater fronto-cingulate reactivity during aggressive response to provocation, but no changes in terms of gray matter structure. White matter has recently been found to differ between patients with PMDD and healthy controls. The present study thus sought to investigate the relationship between white matter volume and SPRM treatment in patients with PMDD. A pharmaco-neuroimaging study was conducted on patients with PMDD participating in a randomized controlled trial. Participants underwent magnetic resonance imaging before and after treatment randomization to ulipristal acetate (an SPRM), or placebo, for three months. The interaction effect of treatment by time on white matter volume (WMV) was assessed. Voxel based morphometry analyses were performed on both a whole brain exploratory level and on regions of interest. No treatment effect was observed on WMV in any region, including the anterior thalamic radiations, cingulum, forceps minor, fornix, inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus, superior cerebellar peduncle, superior longitudinal fasciculus, and uncinate fasciculus. This is the first finding to indicate that no white matter volume alterations follow three-month progesterone antagonism, suggesting that white matter volume does not participate in symptom relief upon SPRM treatment for PMDD.
