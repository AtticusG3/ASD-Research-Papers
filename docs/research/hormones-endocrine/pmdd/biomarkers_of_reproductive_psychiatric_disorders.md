## Abstract
While biomarkers are widely used in other medical fields, psychiatry has yet to introduce reliable biological diagnostic tools. Female reproductive transitions provide a unique window of opportunity for investigating psychiatric biomarkers. Hormonal changes across menstruation, pregnancy, parturition and perimenopause can have dramatic effects on mental health in vulnerable individuals, enabling the identification of unique biomarkers associated with these fluctuations.
This review integrates current evidence concerning potential biomarkers, with focus on recent human studies in perinatal depression, anxiety and obsessive-compulsive disorder, postpartum psychosis, premenstrual dysphoric disorder and perimenopausal depression.
We identified potential articles to be included in this narrative review by using PubMed to obtain articles in English since 2010 on the six conditions listed above, with the additional keywords of 'biomarker', 'epigenetics', 'neuroactive steroid', 'immune', 'inflammatory' and 'neuroimaging'.
There is substantial published evidence regarding potential biomarkers of reproductive psychiatric disorders in the areas of epigenetics, neuroactive steroids, immune function and neuroimaging. This body of research holds significant potential to advance biomarker development, uncover disease mechanisms and improve diagnostic and therapeutic strategies, but there is as yet no clinically useful biomarker in commercial development for any reproductive psychiatric disorder.
There is an urgent need for longitudinal, large-scale and multi-modal studies to examine potential biomarkers and better understand their functions across various stages of reproduction.

While biomarkers are widely used in other medical fields, psychiatry has yet to introduce reliable biological diagnostic tools. Female reproductive transitions provide a unique window of opportunity for investigating psychiatric biomarkers. Hormonal changes across menstruation, pregnancy, parturition and perimenopause can have dramatic effects on mental health in vulnerable individuals, enabling the identification of unique biomarkers associated with these fluctuations.
Aims
This review integrates current evidence concerning potential biomarkers, with focus on recent human studies in perinatal depression, anxiety and obsessive–compulsive disorder, postpartum psychosis, premenstrual dysphoric disorder and perimenopausal depression.

We identified potential articles to be included in this narrative review by using PubMed to obtain articles in English since 2010 on the six conditions listed above, with the additional keywords of ‘biomarker’, ‘epigenetics’, ‘neuroactive steroid’, ‘immune’, ‘inflammatory’ and ‘neuroimaging’.
