## Abstract
Premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) is hypothesized to stem from maladaptive neural sensitivity to ovarian steroid hormone fluctuations. Recently, we found thinner cortices in individuals with PMDD, compared to healthy controls, during the symptomatic phase. Here, we aimed at investigating whether such differences illustrate state-like characteristics specific to the symptomatic phase, or trait-like features defining PMDD. Patients and controls were scanned using structural magnetic resonance imaging during the mid-follicular and late-luteal phase of the menstrual cycle. Group-by-phase interaction effects on cortical architecture metrics (cortical thickness, gyrification index, cortical complexity, and sulcal depth) were assessed using surface-based morphometry. Independently of menstrual cycle phase, a main effect of diagnostic group on surface metrics was found, primarily illustrating thinner cortices (0.3 < Cohen's d > 1.1) and lower gyrification indices (0.4 < Cohen's d > 1.0) in patients compared to controls. Furthermore, menstrual cycle-specific effects were detected across all participants, depicting a decrease in cortical thickness (0.4 < Cohen's d > 1.7) and region-dependent changes in cortical folding metrics (0.4 < Cohen's d > 2.2) from the mid-follicular to the late luteal phase. Small effects (d = 0.3) require a larger sample size to be accurately characterized. These findings provide initial evidence of trait-like cortical characteristics of the brain of individuals with premenstrual dysphoric disorder, together with indications of menstrual cycle-related variations in cortical architecture in patients and controls. Further investigations exploring whether these differences constitute stable vulnerability markers or develop over the years may help understand PMDD etiology.
