Abstract
Premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) has been hypothesized to be related to an altered sensitivity of the γ-aminobutyric acid type A (GABA
A
) receptor to progesterone-derived neurosteroids. GABA
A
receptor sensitivity to neurosteroid-modulation is dependent on its subunit composition. In the present study, we used quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reactions (RT-qPCR) to compare messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) expression of GABA
A
receptor subunits in peripheral mononuclear cells (PBMCs) across the menstrual cycle in 29 women with PMDD and 27 controls. We related mRNA subunit expression to serum levels of neurosteroids and to functional activation of the amygdala, a key brain region involved in emotion generation, measured using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Women with PMDD had lower mRNA expression of the delta GABA
A
receptor subunit during the symptomatic, luteal phase (compared to the asymptomatic, follicular phase) of the menstrual cycle. Lower delta mRNA expression was related to higher amygdala activation in PMDD women. GABA
A
receptors incorporating the delta subunit are especially sensitive to neurosteroid modulation. It is possible that the mood symptoms of PMDD are mediated by an inability to effectively adjust the expression of this receptor type in response to neurosteroid fluctuations, leading to dysregulation GABAergic tone and increased activity in emotion-generating brain circuits.

Introduction
Premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) affects 2–6% of menstruating women and is associated with significant impairment and lowered quality of life [
1
,
2
]. The disorder is characterized by debilitating mood symptoms in the luteal (premenstrual) phase of the menstrual cycle. Ovulation, and the subsequent production of progesterone characterizing the luteal phase, is a prerequisite for mood deterioration in PMDD [
3
]. One hypothesis for PMDD is that it may be a disorder of altered sensitivity to progesterone’s neurosteroid metabolites - such as allopregnanolone (ALLO) - which are potent positive modulators of the γ-aminobutyric acid type A (GABA
A
) receptor [
4
].
The GABA
A
R is composed of five subunits from a possible 19: α1–6, β1–3, γ1–3, ρ1–3, δ, ε, π, and θ [
5
]. The pharmacodynamic properties of the receptor, including its sensitivity to neurosteroids, are determined by its subunit composition [
6
,
7
]. Neural expression of α, β, γ and δ subunits has been shown in mice to be influenced by the estrous cycle, stress induction and administration of neurosteroids and other GABA
A
modulating drugs [
8
,
9
,
10
,
11
,
12
,
13
]. Interestingly, α4 and δ-containing receptors are highly sensitive to ALLO, and are upregulated by ALLO withdrawal after chronic exposure, and paradoxically, also by acute ALLO exposure [
11
,
14
,
15
]. ALLO-mediated increases in expression of δ-containing receptors during late diestrus (analogous to the human late-luteal phase) in the mouse have been shown to mediate lowered neuronal excitability and diminished anxiety behaviors [
12
]. Knock-out (δ−/δ− and δ+/δ−) mice show depressive behaviors upon withdrawal from long-term progesterone/ALLO exposure (i.e. pregnancy), which are alleviated by a specific δ-receptor agonist in (δ+/δ−) mice [
16
]. In summary, these findings suggest that GABA
A
Rs, and δ-GABA
A
Rs in particular, are subject to dynamic regulation in conditions of fluctuating ALLO levels. Efficient regulation of these receptors seems to be crucial to maintain physiological neural excitability and euthymic mood. Indirect evidence for altered regulation of GABA
A
Rs in PMDD across the menstrual cycle comes from pharmacological challenge studies, which have shown that women with PMDD have abnormal pharmacodynamic responses to GABA
A
-active substances, including benzodiazepines [
17
,
18
], ethanol [
19
], and ALLO [
20
]. Furthermore, we recently showed that levels of ALLO in relation to its 3β-epimer isoallopregnanolone (ISO) (which specifically antagonizes ALLO’s effect at the GABA
A
R) are associated with differential activation of the amygdala, a brain region commonly implicated in the psychopathology of mood disorders [
21
]. However, studies that directly quantify GABA
A
R subunit expression and its influence on neural activity and premenstrual mood in PMDD are lacking.
Methods for studying changes in specific subunit composition of the GABA
A
R in the living human brain are limited. However, GABA
A
Rs are expressed elsewhere in the body, including in circulating cells of the immune systems [
22
]. The expression of GABA
A
R subunits in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) has previously been shown to be modulated by pregnancy and depression in women [
23
]. However, GABA
A
R subunit expression has never been analyzed across the human menstrual cycle. PBMCs may thus offer a unique opportunity to study GABA
A
R plastic changes in response to altered ovarian hormone levels in PMDD.
We aimed to measure changes in mRNA expression of GABA
A
R subunits in PBMCs of women with PMDD and asymptomatic controls across the menstrual cycle. Furthermore, we investigated whether differential GABA
A
R subunit expression in the symptomatic, luteal phase was related to amygdala reactivity during an emotional task, determined using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). We also related differential GABA
A
R subunit expression to premenstrual symptom severity, and to serum levels of ALLO and ISO.
Methods
The sample of women included in this study has been described in one of our previous publications, which investigated emotion-induced brain activity using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) [
21
]. Participant recruitment, eligibility criteria, PMDD diagnostic procedures and steroid quantification are thus identical to the ones described earlier [
21
]. The same is true for MRI acquisition procedures, preprocessing and first-level (individual-level) analyses of fMRI data. In the present study, we provide only brief descriptions of the methods that have previously been described [
21
].
Subjects
Twenty-nine women with PMDD and 27 asymptomatic controls were included. General inclusion criteria were: ages 18–45 years, regular menstrual cycles (25–31 days), use of non-hormonal contraceptives, and oral and written consent. Exclusion criteria included: significant ongoing psychiatric or somatic condition, current use of steroid hormone or psychotropic medication (including herbal remedies), drug or alcohol abuse, and pregnancy. Minimum wash-out periods of three months for psychotropics drugs (e.g. selective serotonin inhibitors) and one month for hormonal contraceptives were required prior to entering the study. In addition, a minimum “wash-out” period of three months and resuming of normal menstrual cycling was required if a woman had newly given birth or breastfed a child. Potential participants (both PMDD and control groups) were screened for past and current psychiatric conditions as well as drug/alcohol abuse in the past year using the Mini international Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) questionnaire [
24
]. Due to their high prevalence, eating disorders and depressive episodes were accepted, given that they had been in complete remission for a minimum of two years. In addition, all participants provided daily ratings of mood, psychological and physical symptoms prior to inclusion using the Daily Record of Severity of Problems (DRSP) for a minimum of two menstrual cycles. The DRSP is a reliable and validated tool for PMDD diagnosis [
25
], and was implemented via a web platform.
PMDD diagnosis
PMDD was confirmed using DRSP ratings and the algorithm formulated by Endicott et al [
25
]. Briefly, criteria had to be met for two menstrual cycles and were as follows: (1) in the mid-follicular phase (days +6–+10), no mean symptom scores greater than mild; (2) in the late-luteal phase (days −5–−1), moderate symptoms on at least one mood item, and five symptoms overall; (3) symptoms in the late-luteal phase impacted functioning in daily life.
Control women were included if they had no average symptoms greater than mild during either the follicular or luteal phase of the menstrual cycle.
Study design and sample collection
Two study visits occurred once in the mid-follicular phase (days +5–+11) and once in the late-luteal phase (days −8–−1). Menstrual cycles were tracked for each participant during screening and throughout the study period to provide better estimates of average menstrual cycle length. We estimated that ovulation would occur 14 days prior to the next onset of menses and scheduled study sessions thereafter. Ovulation was confirmed through serum progesterone levels as well as self-reports of menses onset. Luteal phase progesterone concentrations were required to fall within 2 standard deviations (SD) of the standardized progesterone curve [
26
] for the menstrual cycle day during which the study visit occurred. On each visit, participants underwent fMRI scanning. Prior to scanning, serum samples were drawn by antecubital puncture in BD Vacutainer CPT cell preparation tubes with added sodium heparin (Becton Dickinson) and immediately centrifuged at 1500
g
for 15 min at room temperature. Half of the serum was aliquoted to sterile sodium-heparin containing cryogenic vials (Avantor, VWR) and frozen at −80 °C within 30 min for subsequent quantification of progesterone ISO, and ALLO levels. The remaining plasma and buffy coat were kept on ice until PBMC isolation within 15 min.
PBMC separation
RPMI-1640 medium (Sigma Aldrich) was added to the cell suspensions containing buffy coat and plasma and centrifuged at 250
g
for 10 min at room temperature. The resultant pellet was resuspended in fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Sigma Aldrich) to reach a concentration of 1 × 107 cells/ml. The same volume of cell freezing medium, composed of 75% heat-inactived FBS and 25% dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) (Sigma Aldrich), was added drop-by-drop to the resuspended pellet. The samples were then aliquoted to Nunc cryogenic vials (Sigma Aldrich) and placed in a CoolCell freezing container (Sigma Aldrich) to ensure a slow and gradual cooling to −80 °C.
Total RNA isolation and real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR)
Total RNA was isolated using RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) and quantified with Nanodrop (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Total RNA (500 ng) was reverse-transcribed into cDNA in a 25 µl reaction mixture using High Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcriptase Kit with RNase Inhibitor (Applied Biosystems). The reaction mixture was then incubated under the following conditions: 10 min at 25 °C, 120 min at 37 °C, 5 min at 85 °C (to inactivate the reaction), and then held at 4 °C. To ensure absence of genomic DNA contamination of the isolated RNA, a negative control was included by omitting the reverse transcriptase enzyme from the reaction. Furthermore, a ‘no template’ control (NTC) reaction was performed that included all components except for the cDNA template, which was then substituted with water. The final products were stored at −20 °C before being used for qPCR.
Real-time qPCRs were performed in a 20 µl reaction mixture containing 5.42 ng cDNA, 1 x TaqMan Fast Advanced Master Mix (Thermo Fisher Scientific), and 1 x Taqman probe and primer for each gene of interest (Thermo Fisher Scientific). To test the specificity of the PCR conditions, cDNA from human whole brain (TaKaRa Bio Europe) was used as a positive control. TATA-binding protein (TBP) mRNA was used as the endogenous internal control gene, as it has been shown to be a stable and reliable reference gene in unselected leukocytes [
27
], and has previously been used as reference for qPCR of GABA
A
R subunit mRNA in human PBMCs [
23
]. TBP probes were labelled with the fluorochrome dye VIC and GABA
A
subunit probes with FAM.
We chose to quantify mRNA for the following GABA
A
R subunits: α1, α4, α5, β2, β3, γ2 and δ. These were chosen as they have been shown to be expressed in PBMCs [
22
,
23
], GABA
A
R incorporating these subunits are sensitive to modulation by neurosteroids [
28
], are modulated by mental health status [
8
,
9
,
28
], or have been previously implicated in the pathophysiology of PMDD (α4, δ) [
29
,
30
]. See Table
S1
for the corresponding TaqMan assays (ThermoFisher Scientific).
Amplification was performed in 96-well blocks using the QuantStudio 6 Flex System (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with initial denaturation at 95 °C for 20 s, followed by 45 cycles of denaturation at 95 °C for 1 s, and annealing and extension at 60 °C for 20 s. Ct values were determined by software supplied by the QuantStudio system. Ct values of each GABA
A
subunit mRNA were normalized against the TBP internal reference gene, using the comparative Ct (2
-ΔCt
) method [
31
].
Progesterone and neurosteroid quantification
Peripheral progesterone levels were quantified using chemiluminescent immunoassays by the central hospital laboratory at Norrland University Hospital, Umeå, Sweden. Detectable antibody-hapten complexes were prepared by incubating samples with progesterone-specific antibodies, streptavidin-coated microparticles and a ruthenium complex-marked derivate. The detection limit for serum progesterone was 0.05 ng/ml.
ALLO and ISO samples were quantified using ultra-high performance liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) by LabLytica, Uppsala, Sweden. Serum samples were first extracted using liquid-liquid extraction in a hexane/ether solvent phase and then derivatized using 3-aminooxypropyl (trimethyl) ammonium bromide, to improve selectivity and sensitivity of detection. The lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) was 0.2 nM for ALLO and 0.1 nM for ISO.
Experimental paradigm (fMRI task)
During the fMRI session, participants performed an emotional discrimination task, which is known to reliable engage the amygdala [
32
]. The task consisted of matching angry or sad faces (emotion condition) and vertical or horizontal ellipses (sensorimotor control condition). The emotional context and sex of the faces presented were balanced across trials. The paradigm was a block design, including four blocks of faces (24 trials) and five blocks of shapes (30 trials).
MRI acquisition and preprocessing
MRI images were acquired using a 3.0 T Discovery MR750 (General Electric, Madison, WI, USA) scanner available through the Umeå Center for Functional Brain Imaging (UFBI). Acquisition parameters for T1-weighted, and blood-oxygen level dependent (BOLD) images are described previously [
21
].
Preprocessing of fMRI data was performed using the FSL
FMRI Expert Analysis Tool
(FEAT) [
33
], and included motion correction by volume-wise rigid body transformation to the middle volume, correction for magnetic field inhomogeneities, slice timing correction, spatial smoothing with a 5-mm full-width at half maximum (FWHM) Gaussian kernel, high-pass (cut-off = 100 s) temporal filtering and spatial normalization into Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space by affine (12 DOF) and non-linear registration (warp-resolution 8 mm).
First-level (subject-level) statistics were obtained using a general lineal model (GLM) for the contrast of interest [
Faces
>
Shapes
]. Regressors of no interest were motion parameters estimated from the spatial realignment and frames corrupted by large movements detected by FSL’s Motion Outliers tool (default metric = refrms).
Statistical analyses
GABA

R subunit mRNA expression
Statistical analyses were performed using R [
34
] and the rstatix package [
35
]. Analyses were restricted to GABA
A
R subunits that were expressed in at least 2/3 technical replicates in most (>50%) participants. Two-way repeated measures ANCOVAs were conducted to detect
Group
,
Phase
and
Group x Phase
interaction effects, while controlling for psychiatric history, which tended to differ between the groups (see Results). We chose to control for psychiatric history as depression has previously been associated with altered GABA
A
R subunit mRNA expression in PBMCs of pregnant women [
23
]. Post-hoc pairwise t-tests were used to assess the direction of effects and resultant
p
-values were adjusted using the Bonferroni method. Initially, ANOVA assumptions of normality and heterogeneity of variance were checked using quantile-quantile (QQ)-plots, Shapiro-Wilk’s test and Levene’s test (means and standard deviations of 2
-ΔCt
values for each tested subunit are provided in Table
S4
). Outliers were identified using the boxplot method and were classed as extreme if values were above or below 3 times the interquartile range (IQR). In all subunits investigated, extreme outliers skewed the data: we therefore opted to present ANOVA results after addressing outliers in two different ways – log-transforming data to make it conform to a more normal distribution or excluding extreme outliers. We also present distribution of the untreated data using boxplots.
Correlations to steroids and symptoms
Non-parametric spearman correlations were used to determine whether luteal-phase concentrations of ISO, ALLO and the ratio ISO/ALLO were related to differentially expressed GABA
A
R subunits. The variable ISO/ALLO was log-transformed to minimize problems related to the asymmetry of ratios [
36
]. In addition, in PMDD women, differentially expressed GABA
A
R subunits were correlated to DRSP symptom ratings obtained during menstrual cycles screened prior to inclusion. Ratings given during days −8–−1 were averaged across all screened cycles. DRSP measures assessed were total symptom score (mean of items 1 to 21 in the DRSP), depression score (mean of items 1–3), anxiety score (item 4), emotional lability score (mean of items 5 and 6) and irritability score (mean of items 7 and 8). Correlation tests of steroid and symptom measures, respectively, were corrected for multiple comparisons using FDR. Results were considered significant if

Relationship to fMRI measure
Mean BOLD parameter estimates were extracted from a region-of-interest (ROI) that included the right basolateral amygdala and a portion of the right parahippocampal gyrus. The ROI is derived from an analysis presented in our previous paper [
21
], which showed that task-related activation in this region exhibited an altered relationship to ISO/ALLO levels between PMDD women and controls during the luteal phase. Given that ALLO targets GABA
A
Rs, and that receptor composition modulates its pharmacodynamic properties [
9
], we wanted to examine whether differential expression of GABA
A
R subunits also related to activity in this specific region. Thus, for differentially expressed GABA
A
R subunits, women with PMDD were stratified into two equal groups with
high
or
low
luteal phase levels of the subunit.
High
and
low
groups were compared using Wilcoxon rank t-tests based on estimates of amygdala activation during the luteal phase.
Results
Background characteristics
Both the PMDD and control groups mainly consisted of young (mean
PMDD/Control
= 28 years) women without children (PMDD = 69% nulliparous, Control = 74% nulliparous). There were no significant differences in age, body mass index, menstrual cycle length or parity between the groups (Table
S2
). Psychiatric history tended to differ between groups (
p
= 0.10): 31% of PMDD but only 11% of control women reported past depressive episodes. Progesterone and neurosteroid levels did not differ between groups across the menstrual cycle. Details of participants characteristics can be found in [
21
].
Expression of GABA
A
R subunit mRNA in PBMCs
The δ, β2 and β3 subunits were detected in at least 2/3 technical replicates in most women (Fig.
1
, Table
S3
). The δ subunit was the most reliable and detected in 87% of samples across the menstrual cycle. The β2 and β3 subunits were measured in 75 and 67% of samples, respectively. Conversely, mRNA of α1, α4, α5 and γ2 subunits were undetectable in the majority of samples investigated. Chi Square tests confirmed that there were no significant differences in detection rates between groups in either phase of the menstrual cycle.

Differential expression of GABA

There was a significant group by phase interaction effect on the expression of δ subunit mRNA (ANCOVA with log-transformed 2

values:
F
(1,40 = 5.67,

). The interaction effect was driven by a decrease in δ mRNA during the luteal phase, compared to the follicular phase (

-ΔCt
values were log-transformed, or whether extreme outliers were removed outright from the analysis prior to being input into the ANOVA model.

]. 2

values were compared using a 2-by-2 mixed ANCOVA design, which controlled for psychiatric history. Data are illustrated with boxplots, where whiskers represent ± 1.5IQR. In each row (a, b, c corresponding to δ, β2 and β3), boxplots on the left illustrate raw data, and the middle and right plots show two alternative ways of handling outliers: using log-transformed values (middle), and removal of extreme outliers ± 3IQR (left).

Significant group-by-phase effects were detected for δ mRNA expression (ANCOVA1, log-transformed values: F(1,40) = 5.67,

There was a significant main effect of menstrual cycle phase on β3 expression (ANCOVA1, log-transformed values:

Findings were similar for the β2 subunit (Fig.

). A significant phase effect (ANCOVA on log-transformed values:
F
(1,32) = 4.377,

p
adj
= 0.01). Results were not significantly influenced by psychiatric history.
No significant effects of group, phase or interactions effects were detected on β3 subunit mRNA expression (Fig.
2c
). However, pairwise comparisons detected a phase difference in the control group, whereby β3 mRNA expression was increased in the luteal, compared to the follicular phase (
p
adj
= 0.04).
No relationship between neurosteroid levels, symptoms, and GABA
A
R subunit mRNA expression
No significant correlations were found between ALLO, ISO or ISO/ALLO and mRNA expression of the δ, β2 or β3 subunits in the luteal phase in either group. In addition, δ, β2 or β3 subunits expression was unrelated to total premenstrual symptoms, or core mood symptoms.
Reduced expression of δ subunit mRNA is associated with higher amygdala activity
Women with PMDD with lower mRNA expression of the δ subunit in PBMCs had higher emotion-related amygdala activity during the luteal phase, compared with women with higher expression of the subunit (
p
= 0.04) (Fig.
3
). Amygdala activation was not related to high or low mRNA expression of β2 or β3 subunits.

Discussion
The present study provides the first evidence of differential GABA
A
R subunit gene expression across the menstrual cycle in women with PMDD. Specifically, δ and β2 subunit mRNAs were decreased in PBMCs in the luteal phase compared to the follicular phase of women with PMDD. Furthermore, lower δ subunit mRNA expression in PMDD was related to increased amygdala activation during an emotional task (compared to a sensorimotor control task) during the luteal phase. Our findings suggest that altered GABA
A
R plasticity in PMDD mediates altered reactivity of brain regions involved in emotion generation, which might explain the characteristic mood symptoms of the disorder.
GABA
A
R containing δ subunits mediate tonic (persistent) inhibition and are thus thought to be key modulators of neuronal excitability in the CNS [
6
,
37
]. In addition, δ-containing GABA
A
R are particularly sensitive to positive allosteric modulation by neurosteroids such as ALLO [
6
,
7
,
38
]. Some have even argued that δ-containing GABA
A
R are the preferred, if not the only, site of action for neurosteroids in the physiological concentration range [
39
,
40
,
41
]. Rodent studies have shown that δ subunit expression in the brain is regulated by reproductive events [
12
,
13
,
16
]. Regulatory effects seem to be directly mediated by ALLO (and not progesterone), as regulation of the δ subunit can be inhibited by application of finasteride (which blocks the conversion of progesterone to ALLO) and is unaffected by mifepristone (a progesterone receptor antagonist) [
13
]. Studies have found that down-regulation of δ-GABA
A
Rs occurs in the hippocampus and amygdala in the presence of chronically high ALLO levels, while up-regulation is seen upon steroid withdrawal [
12
,
13
,
16
]. Thus, δ-GABA
A
Rs are under constant dynamic modulation across the ovarian cycle, and deficits in this system (such as in δ−/δ− or δ+/δ− knock-out mice) are associated with increased neuronal excitability and anxiety [
12
,
13
]. Our finding of reduced δ subunit expression in women with PMDD may indicate an impaired up-regulation of δ-GABA
A
Rs in the context of ALLO-withdrawal in the late luteal phase. This is further supported by studies of GABA
A
R sensitivity in PMDD showing that PMDD women are less sensitive to low doses of ethanol and pregnanolone (the 5β-pregnane epimer of ALLO) in the late luteal compared to the mid-follicular phase [
19
,
42
]. Both ethanol and pregnanolone are thought to be particularly potent modulators of δ-containing GABA
A
Rs [
43
,
44
]. In contrast, women with PMDD have previously been shown to be more sensitive to supraphysiological doses of ALLO in the luteal phase [
45
]. However, supraphysiological doses of ALLO also activate synaptic γ2-containing GABA
A
Rs [
7
,
37
], and differences in sensitivity between patients and controls in this context may thus be related to differential modulation of other GABA
A
Rs subtypes, which were unfortunately not detectable in the present study. Moreover, altered ALLO sensitivity in PMDD may be influenced by other factors that were not investigated in the present study. First, lower cerebral GABA levels in the luteal phase have been reported in women with PMDD [
46
]. Since neurosteroid efficacy at the δ GABA
A
R is dependent on ambient GABA concentrations [
47
], lower GABA levels may mediate a lower sensitivity to neurosteroids. Second, δ GABA
A
R tone may be influenced by altered neurosteroid metabolism and synthesis in the brain. While this has never been investigated in PMDD, reduced levels of ALLO in the cerebrospinal fluid is found in conditions with overlapping symptomatology, including depression, anxiety, and chronic stress [
48
,
49
]. Nonetheless, findings from studies of progesterone/ALLO withdrawal in δ-GABA
A
R-deficient rodents provides an interesting parallel with PMDD [
12
,
13
]. Inefficient regulation of δ-GABA
A
Rs in response to ALLO fluctuations may thus be an important mechanism underlying the susceptibility of PMDD women to experience severe symptoms in response to ovarian hormone fluctuations.
Remarkably, we found that lower δ subunit expression was associated with increased activity in the basolateral amygdala. This is particularly pertinent to explaining the mood symptoms of PMDD as the amygdala is thought to signal salience and novelty of stimuli and participates in the generation of emotion [
50
,
51
,
52
]. Furthermore, amygdala hyperactivity has been found to be a transdiagnostic feature of multiple psychiatric disorders, including anxiety and depressive disorders [
53
], and is thought to mediate exaggerated and inappropriate reactivity to stimuli [
54
]. One of the most consistent findings in neuroimaging studies of PMDD is that amygdala activity is increased in the luteal phase [
55
]. One early fMRI study, albeit in healthy women, could show that exogenous administration of progesterone resulting in luteal-phase ALLO levels could selectively enhance amygdala activity in response to emotional stimuli [
56
]. In addition, we have previously shown that activity in the basolateral amygdala is differentially associated with ISO/ALLO levels in PMDD, as compared to control women [
21
]. δ-GABA
A
Rs are expressed in the amygdala, although their precise location seems to be species-specific. Indeed, they are found most abundantly in the intercalated cell masses in mouse [
57
] and in the basolateral amygdala in the rhesus monkey [
58
]. Histochemical stains of δ subunits in the human brain are not available. Nonetheless, a study in mice showed that ALLO influences neural activity in the basolateral amygdala, and that this effect was mediated by δ-GABA
A
Rs [
59
]. In the same study, ALLO-induced modulation of the basolateral amygdala related to anxiety expression [
59
]. The amygdala may thus be a key region mediating ALLO’s modulatory effects on mood, through its actions on δ-GABA
A
Rs. However, it is important to note that δ-GABA
A
R expression has been found to be altered in conditions of stress, psychiatric disorders, alcohol abuse, and reproductive events in other regions of the brain, including frontal regions and hippocampus [
9
,
13
,
40
,
60
]. Further investigations should attempt to determine the behavior consequences of altered expression of δ-GABA
A
R in other brain regions, and in relation to other important modulators such as stress, to gain a better understanding of the neuropsychopathology of PMDD.
The significance of differential β subunit expression in PMDD is not clear. The isoform of the β subunit is not thought to affect neurosteroid modulation of GABA
A
R function [
7
,
61
]. However, functional GABA
A
Rs require the inclusion of β subunits, and β3 seems to be particularly important for inhibitory transmission - at least in the hippocampus - as evidenced by significant reductions in inhibitory currents following knock-out of β3 in mice, but not deletion of β1 or β2 [
62
]. Furthermore, neurosteroid-dependent phosphorylation of the β3 subunit via membrane progesterone receptors promotes GABA
A
R insertion in the cell membrane leading to increased tonic inhibition [
63
,
64
]. In addition, the β3 subunit has been demonstrated to be strictly required for spontaneous gating of the GABA
A
R, which results in neuronal inhibitory currents independent of GABA [
65
]. Higher β3 expression in the luteal phase in controls may thus contribute to reduced neuronal excitability in these women. Conversely, an altered proportion of β2/β3 subunit in GABA
A
Rs in PMDD indicates further abnormalities in GABA
A
R plasticity, which possibly confer reduced GABAergic tone in the luteal phase.
Our findings must be considered in light of the following limitations. The first, and most important, is that we base our discussion about GABA
A
R subunit expression on measures of mRNA levels in PBMCs. However, a myriad of posttranslational mechanisms contribute to poor observed correspondence between mRNA levels and functional proteins [
66
]. This might also explain why we did not find significant relationships between serum levels of ALLO and GABA
A
R subunits. However, genes that are differentially expressed (in our case between menstrual cycle phases, and between patients and control) may correlate better to their protein product [
66
]. Nonetheless, studies which also examine GABA
A
R subunit protein expression are necessary to determine whether subunits are truly differentially expressed in PMDD. A second limitation is that we do not know whether GABA
A
R subunit mRNAs in PBMCs is related to expression in the brain. However, altered gene expression in PBMCs has been shown to reflect brain changes following maternal separation in rodents [
67
]. In humans, PBMC gene expression (amongst which, genes coding for GABA
A
receptor subunits) has been used to successfully predict onset and progression of PTSD in trauma-survivors [
68
]. Changes in PBMC gene expression may thus provide some clues about transcriptional changes in the brain. A third limitation is that mRNA levels of GABA
A
R subunits in our samples were low, and many PCR cycles (>35) were required for detection. This meant that standard deviations of Ct values among replicates were relatively high, and for most subunits, mRNA levels were undetectable. The variability of our data is problematic and may have influenced our results. Lastly, mood symptom ratings were averaged from screening cycles and not collected during actual scanning days. This might have influenced our null finding in relating symptom severity to GABA
A
R subunit expression.
In conclusion, our study is the first quantification of gene expression of GABA
A
R subunits in women with PMDD. We found evidence of reduced δ subunit expression in PMDD women, which was related to increased reactivity to emotional stimuli in the amygdala. Abnormal regulation of δ-containing GABA
A
R by ALLO in the amygdala might be an important pathophysiological mechanism by which symptoms in the luteal phase are elicited. Pharmacological studies using drugs which specifically target δ GABA
A
R receptors may provide interesting insights into how modulation of this receptor correlates to behavioral change in PMDD.

 Master Mix (Thermo Fisher Scientific), and 1 x Taqman probe and primer for each gene of interest (Thermo Fisher Scientific). To test the specificity of the PCR conditions, cDNA from human whole brain (TaKaRa Bio Europe) was used as a positive control. TATA-binding protein (TBP) mRNA was used as the endogenous internal control gene, as it has been shown to be a stable and reliable reference gene in unselected leukocytes [
27
], and has previously been used as reference for qPCR of GABA
A
R subunit mRNA in human PBMCs [
23
]. TBP probes were labelled with the fluorochrome dye VIC and GABA
A
subunit probes with FAM.
We chose to quantify mRNA for the following GABA
A
R subunits: α1, α4, α5, β2, β3, γ2 and δ. These were chosen as they have been shown to be expressed in PBMCs [
22
,
23
], GABA
A
R incorporating these subunits are sensitive to modulation by neurosteroids [
28
], are modulated by mental health status [
8
,
9
,
28
], or have been previously implicated in the pathophysiology of PMDD (α4, δ) [
29
,
30
]. See Table
S1
for the corresponding TaqMan assays (ThermoFisher Scientific).
Amplification was performed in 96-well blocks using the QuantStudio 6 Flex System (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with initial denaturation at 95 °C for 20 s, followed by 45 cycles of denaturation at 95 °C for 1 s, and annealing and extension at 60 °C for 20 s. Ct values were determined by software supplied by the QuantStudio system. Ct values of each GABA
A
subunit mRNA were normalized against the TBP internal reference gene, using the comparative Ct (2
-ΔCt
) method [
31
].
Progesterone and neurosteroid quantification
Peripheral progesterone levels were quantified using chemiluminescent immunoassays by the central hospital laboratory at Norrland University Hospital, Umeå, Sweden. Detectable antibody-hapten complexes were prepared by incubating samples with progesterone-specific antibodies, streptavidin-coated microparticles and a ruthenium complex-marked derivate. The detection limit for serum progesterone was 0.05 ng/ml.
ALLO and ISO samples were quantified using ultra-high performance liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) by LabLytica, Uppsala, Sweden. Serum samples were first extracted using liquid-liquid extraction in a hexane/ether solvent phase and then derivatized using 3-aminooxypropyl (trimethyl) ammonium bromide, to improve selectivity and sensitivity of detection. The lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) was 0.2 nM for ALLO and 0.1 nM for ISO.
Experimental paradigm (fMRI task)
During the fMRI session, participants performed an emotional discrimination task, which is known to reliable engage the amygdala [
32
]. The task consisted of matching angry or sad faces (emotion condition) and vertical or horizontal ellipses (sensorimotor control condition). The emotional context and sex of the faces presented were balanced across trials. The paradigm was a block design, including four blocks of faces (24 trials) and five blocks of shapes (30 trials).
MRI acquisition and preprocessing
MRI images were acquired using a 3.0 T Discovery MR750 (General Electric, Madison, WI, USA) scanner available through the Umeå Center for Functional Brain Imaging (UFBI). Acquisition parameters for T1-weighted, and blood-oxygen level dependent (BOLD) images are described previously [
21
].
Preprocessing of fMRI data was performed using the FSL
FMRI Expert Analysis Tool
(FEAT) [
33
], and included motion correction by volume-wise rigid body transformation to the middle volume, correction for magnetic field inhomogeneities, slice timing correction, spatial smoothing with a 5-mm full-width at half maximum (FWHM) Gaussian kernel, high-pass (cut-off = 100 s) temporal filtering and spatial normalization into Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space by affine (12 DOF) and non-linear registration (warp-resolution 8 mm).
First-level (subject-level) statistics were obtained using a general lineal model (GLM) for the contrast of interest [
Faces
>
Shapes
]. Regressors of no interest were motion parameters estimated from the spatial realignment and frames corrupted by large movements detected by FSL’s Motion Outliers tool (default metric = refrms).
Statistical analyses
GABA
A
R subunit mRNA expression
Statistical analyses were performed using R [
34
] and the rstatix package [
35
]. Analyses were restricted to GABA
A
R subunits that were expressed in at least 2/3 technical replicates in most (>50%) participants. Two-way repeated measures ANCOVAs were conducted to detect
Group
,
Phase
and
Group x Phase
interaction effects, while controlling for psychiatric history, which tended to differ between the groups (see Results). We chose to control for psychiatric history as depression has previously been associated with altered GABA
A
R subunit mRNA expression in PBMCs of pregnant women [
23
]. Post-hoc pairwise t-tests were used to assess the direction of effects and resultant
p
-values were adjusted using the Bonferroni method. Initially, ANOVA assumptions of normality and heterogeneity of variance were checked using quantile-quantile (QQ)-plots, Shapiro-Wilk’s test and Levene’s test (means and standard deviations of 2
-ΔCt
values for each tested subunit are provided in Table
S4
). Outliers were identified using the boxplot method and were classed as extreme if values were above or below 3 times the interquartile range (IQR). In all subunits investigated, extreme outliers skewed the data: we therefore opted to present ANOVA results after addressing outliers in two different ways – log-transforming data to make it conform to a more normal distribution or excluding extreme outliers. We also present distribution of the untreated data using boxplots.
Correlations to steroids and symptoms
Non-parametric spearman correlations were used to determine whether luteal-phase concentrations of ISO, ALLO and the ratio ISO/ALLO were related to differentially expressed GABA
A
R subunits. The variable ISO/ALLO was log-transformed to minimize problems related to the asymmetry of ratios [
36
]. In addition, in PMDD women, differentially expressed GABA
A
R subunits were correlated to DRSP symptom ratings obtained during menstrual cycles screened prior to inclusion. Ratings given during days −8–−1 were averaged across all screened cycles. DRSP measures assessed were total symptom score (mean of items 1 to 21 in the DRSP), depression score (mean of items 1–3), anxiety score (item 4), emotional lability score (mean of items 5 and 6) and irritability score (mean of items 7 and 8). Correlation tests of steroid and symptom measures, respectively, were corrected for multiple comparisons using FDR. Results were considered significant if

Relationship to fMRI measure
Mean BOLD parameter estimates were extracted from a region-of-interest (ROI) that included the right basolateral amygdala and a portion of the right parahippocampal gyrus. The ROI is derived from an analysis presented in our previous paper [
21
], which showed that task-related activation in this region exhibited an altered relationship to ISO/ALLO levels between PMDD women and controls during the luteal phase. Given that ALLO targets GABA
A
Rs, and that receptor composition modulates its pharmacodynamic properties [
9
], we wanted to examine whether differential expression of GABA
A
R subunits also related to activity in this specific region. Thus, for differentially expressed GABA
A
R subunits, women with PMDD were stratified into two equal groups with
high
or
low
luteal phase levels of the subunit.
High
and
low
groups were compared using Wilcoxon rank t-tests based on estimates of amygdala activation during the luteal phase.
Results
Background characteristics
Both the PMDD and control groups mainly consisted of young (mean
PMDD/Control
= 28 years) women without children (PMDD = 69% nulliparous, Control = 74% nulliparous). There were no significant differences in age, body mass index, menstrual cycle length or parity between the groups (Table
S2
). Psychiatric history tended to differ between groups (
p
= 0.10): 31% of PMDD but only 11% of control women reported past depressive episodes. Progesterone and neurosteroid levels did not differ between groups across the menstrual cycle. Details of participants characteristics can be found in [
21
].
Expression of GABA
A
R subunit mRNA in PBMCs
The δ, β2 and β3 subunits were detected in at least 2/3 technical replicates in most women (Fig.
1
, Table
S3
). The δ subunit was the most reliable and detected in 87% of samples across the menstrual cycle. The β2 and β3 subunits were measured in 75 and 67% of samples, respectively. Conversely, mRNA of α1, α4, α5 and γ2 subunits were undetectable in the majority of samples investigated. Chi Square tests confirmed that there were no significant differences in detection rates between groups in either phase of the menstrual cycle.

(1,40 = 5.67,

-ΔCt
values were log-transformed, or whether extreme outliers were removed outright from the analysis prior to being input into the ANOVA model.

No significant effects of group, phase or interactions effects were detected on β3 subunit mRNA expression (Fig.

). However, pairwise comparisons detected a phase difference in the control group, whereby β3 mRNA expression was increased in the luteal, compared to the follicular phase (
p

No relationship between neurosteroid levels, symptoms, and GABA
A
R subunit mRNA expression
No significant correlations were found between ALLO, ISO or ISO/ALLO and mRNA expression of the δ, β2 or β3 subunits in the luteal phase in either group. In addition, δ, β2 or β3 subunits expression was unrelated to total premenstrual symptoms, or core mood symptoms.
Reduced expression of δ subunit mRNA is associated with higher amygdala activity
Women with PMDD with lower mRNA expression of the δ subunit in PBMCs had higher emotion-related amygdala activity during the luteal phase, compared with women with higher expression of the subunit (
p
= 0.04) (Fig.
3
). Amygdala activation was not related to high or low mRNA expression of β2 or β3 subunits.

Discussion
The present study provides the first evidence of differential GABA
A
R subunit gene expression across the menstrual cycle in women with PMDD. Specifically, δ and β2 subunit mRNAs were decreased in PBMCs in the luteal phase compared to the follicular phase of women with PMDD. Furthermore, lower δ subunit mRNA expression in PMDD was related to increased amygdala activation during an emotional task (compared to a sensorimotor control task) during the luteal phase. Our findings suggest that altered GABA
A
R plasticity in PMDD mediates altered reactivity of brain regions involved in emotion generation, which might explain the characteristic mood symptoms of the disorder.
GABA
A
R containing δ subunits mediate tonic (persistent) inhibition and are thus thought to be key modulators of neuronal excitability in the CNS [
6
,
37
]. In addition, δ-containing GABA
A
R are particularly sensitive to positive allosteric modulation by neurosteroids such as ALLO [
6
,
7
,
38
]. Some have even argued that δ-containing GABA
A
R are the preferred, if not the only, site of action for neurosteroids in the physiological concentration range [
39
,
40
,
41
]. Rodent studies have shown that δ subunit expression in the brain is regulated by reproductive events [
12
,
13
,
16
]. Regulatory effects seem to be directly mediated by ALLO (and not progesterone), as regulation of the δ subunit can be inhibited by application of finasteride (which blocks the conversion of progesterone to ALLO) and is unaffected by mifepristone (a progesterone receptor antagonist) [
13
]. Studies have found that down-regulation of δ-GABA
A
Rs occurs in the hippocampus and amygdala in the presence of chronically high ALLO levels, while up-regulation is seen upon steroid withdrawal [
12
,
13
,
16
]. Thus, δ-GABA
A
Rs are under constant dynamic modulation across the ovarian cycle, and deficits in this system (such as in δ−/δ− or δ+/δ− knock-out mice) are associated with increased neuronal excitability and anxiety [
12
,
13
]. Our finding of reduced δ subunit expression in women with PMDD may indicate an impaired up-regulation of δ-GABA
A
Rs in the context of ALLO-withdrawal in the late luteal phase. This is further supported by studies of GABA
A
R sensitivity in PMDD showing that PMDD women are less sensitive to low doses of ethanol and pregnanolone (the 5β-pregnane epimer of ALLO) in the late luteal compared to the mid-follicular phase [
19
,
42
]. Both ethanol and pregnanolone are thought to be particularly potent modulators of δ-containing GABA
A
Rs [
43
,
44
]. In contrast, women with PMDD have previously been shown to be more sensitive to supraphysiological doses of ALLO in the luteal phase [
45
]. However, supraphysiological doses of ALLO also activate synaptic γ2-containing GABA
A
Rs [
7
,
37
], and differences in sensitivity between patients and controls in this context may thus be related to differential modulation of other GABA
A
Rs subtypes, which were unfortunately not detectable in the present study. Moreover, altered ALLO sensitivity in PMDD may be influenced by other factors that were not investigated in the present study. First, lower cerebral GABA levels in the luteal phase have been reported in women with PMDD [
46
]. Since neurosteroid efficacy at the δ GABA
A
R is dependent on ambient GABA concentrations [
47
], lower GABA levels may mediate a lower sensitivity to neurosteroids. Second, δ GABA
A
R tone may be influenced by altered neurosteroid metabolism and synthesis in the brain. While this has never been investigated in PMDD, reduced levels of ALLO in the cerebrospinal fluid is found in conditions with overlapping symptomatology, including depression, anxiety, and chronic stress [
48
,
49
]. Nonetheless, findings from studies of progesterone/ALLO withdrawal in δ-GABA
A
R-deficient rodents provides an interesting parallel with PMDD [
12
,
13
]. Inefficient regulation of δ-GABA
A
Rs in response to ALLO fluctuations may thus be an important mechanism underlying the susceptibility of PMDD women to experience severe symptoms in response to ovarian hormone fluctuations.
Remarkably, we found that lower δ subunit expression was associated with increased activity in the basolateral amygdala. This is particularly pertinent to explaining the mood symptoms of PMDD as the amygdala is thought to signal salience and novelty of stimuli and participates in the generation of emotion [
50
,
51
,
52
]. Furthermore, amygdala hyperactivity has been found to be a transdiagnostic feature of multiple psychiatric disorders, including anxiety and depressive disorders [
53
], and is thought to mediate exaggerated and inappropriate reactivity to stimuli [
54
]. One of the most consistent findings in neuroimaging studies of PMDD is that amygdala activity is increased in the luteal phase [
55
]. One early fMRI study, albeit in healthy women, could show that exogenous administration of progesterone resulting in luteal-phase ALLO levels could selectively enhance amygdala activity in response to emotional stimuli [
56
]. In addition, we have previously shown that activity in the basolateral amygdala is differentially associated with ISO/ALLO levels in PMDD, as compared to control women [
21
]. δ-GABA
A
Rs are expressed in the amygdala, although their precise location seems to be species-specific. Indeed, they are found most abundantly in the intercalated cell masses in mouse [
57
] and in the basolateral amygdala in the rhesus monkey [
58
]. Histochemical stains of δ subunits in the human brain are not available. Nonetheless, a study in mice showed that ALLO influences neural activity in the basolateral amygdala, and that this effect was mediated by δ-GABA
A
Rs [
59
]. In the same study, ALLO-induced modulation of the basolateral amygdala related to anxiety expression [
59
]. The amygdala may thus be a key region mediating ALLO’s modulatory effects on mood, through its actions on δ-GABA
A
Rs. However, it is important to note that δ-GABA
A
R expression has been found to be altered in conditions of stress, psychiatric disorders, alcohol abuse, and reproductive events in other regions of the brain, including frontal regions and hippocampus [
9
,
13
,
40
,
60
]. Further investigations should attempt to determine the behavior consequences of altered expression of δ-GABA
A
R in other brain regions, and in relation to other important modulators such as stress, to gain a better understanding of the neuropsychopathology of PMDD.
The significance of differential β subunit expression in PMDD is not clear. The isoform of the β subunit is not thought to affect neurosteroid modulation of GABA
A
R function [
7
,
61
]. However, functional GABA
A
Rs require the inclusion of β subunits, and β3 seems to be particularly important for inhibitory transmission - at least in the hippocampus - as evidenced by significant reductions in inhibitory currents following knock-out of β3 in mice, but not deletion of β1 or β2 [
62
]. Furthermore, neurosteroid-dependent phosphorylation of the β3 subunit via membrane progesterone receptors promotes GABA
A
R insertion in the cell membrane leading to increased tonic inhibition [
63
,
64
]. In addition, the β3 subunit has been demonstrated to be strictly required for spontaneous gating of the GABA
A
R, which results in neuronal inhibitory currents independent of GABA [
65
]. Higher β3 expression in the luteal phase in controls may thus contribute to reduced neuronal excitability in these women. Conversely, an altered proportion of β2/β3 subunit in GABA
A
Rs in PMDD indicates further abnormalities in GABA
A
R plasticity, which possibly confer reduced GABAergic tone in the luteal phase.
Our findings must be considered in light of the following limitations. The first, and most important, is that we base our discussion about GABA
A
R subunit expression on measures of mRNA levels in PBMCs. However, a myriad of posttranslational mechanisms contribute to poor observed correspondence between mRNA levels and functional proteins [
66
]. This might also explain why we did not find significant relationships between serum levels of ALLO and GABA
A
R subunits. However, genes that are differentially expressed (in our case between menstrual cycle phases, and between patients and control) may correlate better to their protein product [
66
]. Nonetheless, studies which also examine GABA
A
R subunit protein expression are necessary to determine whether subunits are truly differentially expressed in PMDD. A second limitation is that we do not know whether GABA
A
R subunit mRNAs in PBMCs is related to expression in the brain. However, altered gene expression in PBMCs has been shown to reflect brain changes following maternal separation in rodents [
67
]. In humans, PBMC gene expression (amongst which, genes coding for GABA
A
receptor subunits) has been used to successfully predict onset and progression of PTSD in trauma-survivors [
68
]. Changes in PBMC gene expression may thus provide some clues about transcriptional changes in the brain. A third limitation is that mRNA levels of GABA
A
R subunits in our samples were low, and many PCR cycles (>35) were required for detection. This meant that standard deviations of Ct values among replicates were relatively high, and for most subunits, mRNA levels were undetectable. The variability of our data is problematic and may have influenced our results. Lastly, mood symptom ratings were averaged from screening cycles and not collected during actual scanning days. This might have influenced our null finding in relating symptom severity to GABA
A
R subunit expression.
In conclusion, our study is the first quantification of gene expression of GABA
A
R subunits in women with PMDD. We found evidence of reduced δ subunit expression in PMDD women, which was related to increased reactivity to emotional stimuli in the amygdala. Abnormal regulation of δ-containing GABA
A
R by ALLO in the amygdala might be an important pathophysiological mechanism by which symptoms in the luteal phase are elicited. Pharmacological studies using drugs which specifically target δ GABA
A
R receptors may provide interesting insights into how modulation of this receptor correlates to behavioral change in PMDD.Transcription of GABA

Abstract
Premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) has been hypothesized to be related to an altered sensitivity of the γ-aminobutyric acid type A (GABA
A
) receptor to progesterone-derived neurosteroids. GABA
A
receptor sensitivity to neurosteroid-modulation is dependent on its subunit composition. In the present study, we used quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reactions (RT-qPCR) to compare messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) expression of GABA
A
receptor subunits in peripheral mononuclear cells (PBMCs) across the menstrual cycle in 29 women with PMDD and 27 controls. We related mRNA subunit expression to serum levels of neurosteroids and to functional activation of the amygdala, a key brain region involved in emotion generation, measured using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Women with PMDD had lower mRNA expression of the delta GABA
A
receptor subunit during the symptomatic, luteal phase (compared to the asymptomatic, follicular phase) of the menstrual cycle. Lower delta mRNA expression was related to higher amygdala activation in PMDD women. GABA
A
receptors incorporating the delta subunit are especially sensitive to neurosteroid modulation. It is possible that the mood symptoms of PMDD are mediated by an inability to effectively adjust the expression of this receptor type in response to neurosteroid fluctuations, leading to dysregulation GABAergic tone and increased activity in emotion-generating brain circuits.

Introduction
Premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) affects 2–6% of menstruating women and is associated with significant impairment and lowered quality of life [
1
,
2
]. The disorder is characterized by debilitating mood symptoms in the luteal (premenstrual) phase of the menstrual cycle. Ovulation, and the subsequent production of progesterone characterizing the luteal phase, is a prerequisite for mood deterioration in PMDD [
3
]. One hypothesis for PMDD is that it may be a disorder of altered sensitivity to progesterone’s neurosteroid metabolites - such as allopregnanolone (ALLO) - which are potent positive modulators of the γ-aminobutyric acid type A (GABA
A
) receptor [
4
].
The GABA
A
R is composed of five subunits from a possible 19: α1–6, β1–3, γ1–3, ρ1–3, δ, ε, π, and θ [
5
]. The pharmacodynamic properties of the receptor, including its sensitivity to neurosteroids, are determined by its subunit composition [
6
,
7
]. Neural expression of α, β, γ and δ subunits has been shown in mice to be influenced by the estrous cycle, stress induction and administration of neurosteroids and other GABA
A
modulating drugs [
8
,
9
,
10
,
11
,
12
,
13
]. Interestingly, α4 and δ-containing receptors are highly sensitive to ALLO, and are upregulated by ALLO withdrawal after chronic exposure, and paradoxically, also by acute ALLO exposure [
11
,
14
,
15
]. ALLO-mediated increases in expression of δ-containing receptors during late diestrus (analogous to the human late-luteal phase) in the mouse have been shown to mediate lowered neuronal excitability and diminished anxiety behaviors [
12
]. Knock-out (δ−/δ− and δ+/δ−) mice show depressive behaviors upon withdrawal from long-term progesterone/ALLO exposure (i.e. pregnancy), which are alleviated by a specific δ-receptor agonist in (δ+/δ−) mice [
16
]. In summary, these findings suggest that GABA
A
Rs, and δ-GABA
A
Rs in particular, are subject to dynamic regulation in conditions of fluctuating ALLO levels. Efficient regulation of these receptors seems to be crucial to maintain physiological neural excitability and euthymic mood. Indirect evidence for altered regulation of GABA
A
Rs in PMDD across the menstrual cycle comes from pharmacological challenge studies, which have shown that women with PMDD have abnormal pharmacodynamic responses to GABA
A
-active substances, including benzodiazepines [
17
,
18
], ethanol [
19
], and ALLO [
20
]. Furthermore, we recently showed that levels of ALLO in relation to its 3β-epimer isoallopregnanolone (ISO) (which specifically antagonizes ALLO’s effect at the GABA
A
R) are associated with differential activation of the amygdala, a brain region commonly implicated in the psychopathology of mood disorders [
21
]. However, studies that directly quantify GABA
A
R subunit expression and its influence on neural activity and premenstrual mood in PMDD are lacking.
Methods for studying changes in specific subunit composition of the GABA
A
R in the living human brain are limited. However, GABA
A
Rs are expressed elsewhere in the body, including in circulating cells of the immune systems [
22
]. The expression of GABA
A
R subunits in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) has previously been shown to be modulated by pregnancy and depression in women [
23
]. However, GABA
A
R subunit expression has never been analyzed across the human menstrual cycle. PBMCs may thus offer a unique opportunity to study GABA
A
R plastic changes in response to altered ovarian hormone levels in PMDD.
We aimed to measure changes in mRNA expression of GABA
A
R subunits in PBMCs of women with PMDD and asymptomatic controls across the menstrual cycle. Furthermore, we investigated whether differential GABA
A
R subunit expression in the symptomatic, luteal phase was related to amygdala reactivity during an emotional task, determined using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). We also related differential GABA
A
R subunit expression to premenstrual symptom severity, and to serum levels of ALLO and ISO.
Methods
The sample of women included in this study has been described in one of our previous publications, which investigated emotion-induced brain activity using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) [
21
]. Participant recruitment, eligibility criteria, PMDD diagnostic procedures and steroid quantification are thus identical to the ones described earlier [
21
]. The same is true for MRI acquisition procedures, preprocessing and first-level (individual-level) analyses of fMRI data. In the present study, we provide only brief descriptions of the methods that have previously been described [
21
].
Subjects
Twenty-nine women with PMDD and 27 asymptomatic controls were included. General inclusion criteria were: ages 18–45 years, regular menstrual cycles (25–31 days), use of non-hormonal contraceptives, and oral and written consent. Exclusion criteria included: significant ongoing psychiatric or somatic condition, current use of steroid hormone or psychotropic medication (including herbal remedies), drug or alcohol abuse, and pregnancy. Minimum wash-out periods of three months for psychotropics drugs (e.g. selective serotonin inhibitors) and one month for hormonal contraceptives were required prior to entering the study. In addition, a minimum “wash-out” period of three months and resuming of normal menstrual cycling was required if a woman had newly given birth or breastfed a child. Potential participants (both PMDD and control groups) were screened for past and current psychiatric conditions as well as drug/alcohol abuse in the past year using the Mini international Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) questionnaire [
24
]. Due to their high prevalence, eating disorders and depressive episodes were accepted, given that they had been in complete remission for a minimum of two years. In addition, all participants provided daily ratings of mood, psychological and physical symptoms prior to inclusion using the Daily Record of Severity of Problems (DRSP) for a minimum of two menstrual cycles. The DRSP is a reliable and validated tool for PMDD diagnosis [
25
], and was implemented via a web platform.
PMDD diagnosis
PMDD was confirmed using DRSP ratings and the algorithm formulated by Endicott et al [
25
]. Briefly, criteria had to be met for two menstrual cycles and were as follows: (1) in the mid-follicular phase (days +6–+10), no mean symptom scores greater than mild; (2) in the late-luteal phase (days −5–−1), moderate symptoms on at least one mood item, and five symptoms overall; (3) symptoms in the late-luteal phase impacted functioning in daily life.
Control women were included if they had no average symptoms greater than mild during either the follicular or luteal phase of the menstrual cycle.
Study design and sample collection
Two study visits occurred once in the mid-follicular phase (days +5–+11) and once in the late-luteal phase (days −8–−1). Menstrual cycles were tracked for each participant during screening and throughout the study period to provide better estimates of average menstrual cycle length. We estimated that ovulation would occur 14 days prior to the next onset of menses and scheduled study sessions thereafter. Ovulation was confirmed through serum progesterone levels as well as self-reports of menses onset. Luteal phase progesterone concentrations were required to fall within 2 standard deviations (SD) of the standardized progesterone curve [
26
] for the menstrual cycle day during which the study visit occurred. On each visit, participants underwent fMRI scanning. Prior to scanning, serum samples were drawn by antecubital puncture in BD Vacutainer CPT cell preparation tubes with added sodium heparin (Becton Dickinson) and immediately centrifuged at 1500
g
for 15 min at room temperature. Half of the serum was aliquoted to sterile sodium-heparin containing cryogenic vials (Avantor, VWR) and frozen at −80 °C within 30 min for subsequent quantification of progesterone ISO, and ALLO levels. The remaining plasma and buffy coat were kept on ice until PBMC isolation within 15 min.
PBMC separation
RPMI-1640 medium (Sigma Aldrich) was added to the cell suspensions containing buffy coat and plasma and centrifuged at 250
g
for 10 min at room temperature. The resultant pellet was resuspended in fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Sigma Aldrich) to reach a concentration of 1 × 107 cells/ml. The same volume of cell freezing medium, composed of 75% heat-inactived FBS and 25% dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) (Sigma Aldrich), was added drop-by-drop to the resuspended pellet. The samples were then aliquoted to Nunc cryogenic vials (Sigma Aldrich) and placed in a CoolCell freezing container (Sigma Aldrich) to ensure a slow and gradual cooling to −80 °C.
Total RNA isolation and real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR)
Total RNA was isolated using RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) and quantified with Nanodrop (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Total RNA (500 ng) was reverse-transcribed into cDNA in a 25 µl reaction mixture using High Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcriptase Kit with RNase Inhibitor (Applied Biosystems). The reaction mixture was then incubated under the following conditions: 10 min at 25 °C, 120 min at 37 °C, 5 min at 85 °C (to inactivate the reaction), and then held at 4 °C. To ensure absence of genomic DNA contamination of the isolated RNA, a negative control was included by omitting the reverse transcriptase enzyme from the reaction. Furthermore, a ‘no template’ control (NTC) reaction was performed that included all components except for the cDNA template, which was then substituted with water. The final products were stored at −20 °C before being used for qPCR.
Real-time qPCRs were performed in a 20 µl reaction mixture containing 5.42 ng cDNA, 1 x TaqMan Fast Advanced Master Mix (Thermo Fisher Scientific), and 1 x Taqman probe and primer for each gene of interest (Thermo Fisher Scientific). To test the specificity of the PCR conditions, cDNA from human whole brain (TaKaRa Bio Europe) was used as a positive control. TATA-binding protein (TBP) mRNA was used as the endogenous internal control gene, as it has been shown to be a stable and reliable reference gene in unselected leukocytes [
27
], and has previously been used as reference for qPCR of GABA
A
R subunit mRNA in human PBMCs [
23
]. TBP probes were labelled with the fluorochrome dye VIC and GABA
A
subunit probes with FAM.
We chose to quantify mRNA for the following GABA
A
R subunits: α1, α4, α5, β2, β3, γ2 and δ. These were chosen as they have been shown to be expressed in PBMCs [
22
,
23
], GABA
A
R incorporating these subunits are sensitive to modulation by neurosteroids [
28
], are modulated by mental health status [
8
,

,
28
], or have been previously implicated in the pathophysiology of PMDD (α4, δ) [
29
,
30
]. See Table
S1
for the corresponding TaqMan assays (ThermoFisher Scientific).
Amplification was performed in 96-well blocks using the QuantStudio 6 Flex System (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with initial denaturation at 95 °C for 20 s, followed by 45 cycles of denaturation at 95 °C for 1 s, and annealing and extension at 60 °C for 20 s. Ct values were determined by software supplied by the QuantStudio system. Ct values of each GABA
A
subunit mRNA were normalized against the TBP internal reference gene, using the comparative Ct (2
-ΔCt
) method [
31
].
Progesterone and neurosteroid quantification
Peripheral progesterone levels were quantified using chemiluminescent immunoassays by the central hospital laboratory at Norrland University Hospital, Umeå, Sweden. Detectable antibody-hapten complexes were prepared by incubating samples with progesterone-specific antibodies, streptavidin-coated microparticles and a ruthenium complex-marked derivate. The detection limit for serum progesterone was 0.05 ng/ml.
ALLO and ISO samples were quantified using ultra-high performance liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) by LabLytica, Uppsala, Sweden. Serum samples were first extracted using liquid-liquid extraction in a hexane/ether solvent phase and then derivatized using 3-aminooxypropyl (trimethyl) ammonium bromide, to improve selectivity and sensitivity of detection. The lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) was 0.2 nM for ALLO and 0.1 nM for ISO.
Experimental paradigm (fMRI task)
During the fMRI session, participants performed an emotional discrimination task, which is known to reliable engage the amygdala [
32
]. The task consisted of matching angry or sad faces (emotion condition) and vertical or horizontal ellipses (sensorimotor control condition). The emotional context and sex of the faces presented were balanced across trials. The paradigm was a block design, including four blocks of faces (24 trials) and five blocks of shapes (30 trials).
MRI acquisition and preprocessing
MRI images were acquired using a 3.0 T Discovery MR750 (General Electric, Madison, WI, USA) scanner available through the Umeå Center for Functional Brain Imaging (UFBI). Acquisition parameters for T1-weighted, and blood-oxygen level dependent (BOLD) images are described previously [
21
].
Preprocessing of fMRI data was performed using the FSL
FMRI Expert Analysis Tool
(FEAT) [
33
], and included motion correction by volume-wise rigid body transformation to the middle volume, correction for magnetic field inhomogeneities, slice timing correction, spatial smoothing with a 5-mm full-width at half maximum (FWHM) Gaussian kernel, high-pass (cut-off = 100 s) temporal filtering and spatial normalization into Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space by affine (12 DOF) and non-linear registration (warp-resolution 8 mm).
First-level (subject-level) statistics were obtained using a general lineal model (GLM) for the contrast of interest [

Shapes
]. Regressors of no interest were motion parameters estimated from the spatial realignment and frames corrupted by large movements detected by FSL’s Motion Outliers tool (default metric = refrms).
Statistical analyses
GABA

R subunit mRNA expression
Statistical analyses were performed using R [
34
] and the rstatix package [
35
]. Analyses were restricted to GABA
A
R subunits that were expressed in at least 2/3 technical replicates in most (>50%) participants. Two-way repeated measures ANCOVAs were conducted to detect
Group
,
Phase
and
Group x Phase
interaction effects, while controlling for psychiatric history, which tended to differ between the groups (see Results). We chose to control for psychiatric history as depression has previously been associated with altered GABA
A
R subunit mRNA expression in PBMCs of pregnant women [
23
]. Post-hoc pairwise t-tests were used to assess the direction of effects and resultant
p
-values were adjusted using the Bonferroni method. Initially, ANOVA assumptions of normality and heterogeneity of variance were checked using quantile-quantile (QQ)-plots, Shapiro-Wilk’s test and Levene’s test (means and standard deviations of 2
-ΔCt
values for each tested subunit are provided in Table
S4
). Outliers were identified using the boxplot method and were classed as extreme if values were above or below 3 times the interquartile range (IQR). In all subunits investigated, extreme outliers skewed the data: we therefore opted to present ANOVA results after addressing outliers in two different ways – log-transforming data to make it conform to a more normal distribution or excluding extreme outliers. We also present distribution of the untreated data using boxplots.
Correlations to steroids and symptoms
Non-parametric spearman correlations were used to determine whether luteal-phase concentrations of ISO, ALLO and the ratio ISO/ALLO were related to differentially expressed GABA
A
R subunits. The variable ISO/ALLO was log-transformed to minimize problems related to the asymmetry of ratios [
36
]. In addition, in PMDD women, differentially expressed GABA
A
R subunits were correlated to DRSP symptom ratings obtained during menstrual cycles screened prior to inclusion. Ratings given during days −8–−1 were averaged across all screened cycles. DRSP measures assessed were total symptom score (mean of items 1 to 21 in the DRSP), depression score (mean of items 1–3), anxiety score (item 4), emotional lability score (mean of items 5 and 6) and irritability score (mean of items 7 and 8). Correlation tests of steroid and symptom measures, respectively, were corrected for multiple comparisons using FDR. Results were considered significant if

< 0.05.
Relationship to fMRI measure
Mean BOLD parameter estimates were extracted from a region-of-interest (ROI) that included the right basolateral amygdala and a portion of the right parahippocampal gyrus. The ROI is derived from an analysis presented in our previous paper [
21
], which showed that task-related activation in this region exhibited an altered relationship to ISO/ALLO levels between PMDD women and controls during the luteal phase. Given that ALLO targets GABA
A
Rs, and that receptor composition modulates its pharmacodynamic properties [
9
], we wanted to examine whether differential expression of GABA
A
R subunits also related to activity in this specific region. Thus, for differentially expressed GABA
A
R subunits, women with PMDD were stratified into two equal groups with
high
or
low
luteal phase levels of the subunit.
High
and
low
groups were compared using Wilcoxon rank t-tests based on estimates of amygdala activation during the luteal phase.
Results
Background characteristics
Both the PMDD and control groups mainly consisted of young (mean
PMDD/Control
= 28 years) women without children (PMDD = 69% nulliparous, Control = 74% nulliparous). There were no significant differences in age, body mass index, menstrual cycle length or parity between the groups (Table
S2
). Psychiatric history tended to differ between groups (
p
= 0.10): 31% of PMDD but only 11% of control women reported past depressive episodes. Progesterone and neurosteroid levels did not differ between groups across the menstrual cycle. Details of participants characteristics can be found in [
21
].
Expression of GABA
A
R subunit mRNA in PBMCs
The δ, β2 and β3 subunits were detected in at least 2/3 technical replicates in most women (Fig.
1
, Table
S3
). The δ subunit was the most reliable and detected in 87% of samples across the menstrual cycle. The β2 and β3 subunits were measured in 75 and 67% of samples, respectively. Conversely, mRNA of α1, α4, α5 and γ2 subunits were undetectable in the majority of samples investigated. Chi Square tests confirmed that there were no significant differences in detection rates between groups in either phase of the menstrual cycle.

Differential expression of GABA

R subunit mRNA across the menstrual cycle in PMDD and control women
There was a significant group by phase interaction effect on the expression of δ subunit mRNA (ANCOVA with log-transformed 2

values:
F
(1,40 = 5.67,
p

). The interaction effect was driven by a decrease in δ mRNA during the luteal phase, compared to the follicular phase (

-ΔCt
values were log-transformed, or whether extreme outliers were removed outright from the analysis prior to being input into the ANOVA model.

values were compared using a 2-by-2 mixed ANCOVA design, which controlled for psychiatric history. Data are illustrated with boxplots, where whiskers represent ± 1.5IQR. In each row (a, b, c corresponding to δ, β2 and β3), boxplots on the left illustrate raw data, and the middle and right plots show two alternative ways of handling outliers: using log-transformed values (middle), and removal of extreme outliers ± 3IQR (left).

Significant group-by-phase effects were detected for δ mRNA expression (ANCOVA1, log-transformed values: F(1,40) = 5.67,

Findings were similar for the β2 subunit (Fig.

p

= 0.01). Results were not significantly influenced by psychiatric history.
No significant effects of group, phase or interactions effects were detected on β3 subunit mRNA expression (Fig.

). However, pairwise comparisons detected a phase difference in the control group, whereby β3 mRNA expression was increased in the luteal, compared to the follicular phase (
p

No relationship between neurosteroid levels, symptoms, and GABA
A
R subunit mRNA expression
No significant correlations were found between ALLO, ISO or ISO/ALLO and mRNA expression of the δ, β2 or β3 subunits in the luteal phase in either group. In addition, δ, β2 or β3 subunits expression was unrelated to total premenstrual symptoms, or core mood symptoms.
Reduced expression of δ subunit mRNA is associated with higher amygdala activity
Women with PMDD with lower mRNA expression of the δ subunit in PBMCs had higher emotion-related amygdala activity during the luteal phase, compared with women with higher expression of the subunit (
p
= 0.04) (Fig.
3
). Amygdala activation was not related to high or low mRNA expression of β2 or β3 subunits.

Discussion
The present study provides the first evidence of differential GABA
A
R subunit gene expression across the menstrual cycle in women with PMDD. Specifically, δ and β2 subunit mRNAs were decreased in PBMCs in the luteal phase compared to the follicular phase of women with PMDD. Furthermore, lower δ subunit mRNA expression in PMDD was related to increased amygdala activation during an emotional task (compared to a sensorimotor control task) during the luteal phase. Our findings suggest that altered GABA
A
R plasticity in PMDD mediates altered reactivity of brain regions involved in emotion generation, which might explain the characteristic mood symptoms of the disorder.
GABA
A
R containing δ subunits mediate tonic (persistent) inhibition and are thus thought to be key modulators of neuronal excitability in the CNS [
6
,
37
]. In addition, δ-containing GABA
A
R are particularly sensitive to positive allosteric modulation by neurosteroids such as ALLO [
6
,
7
,
38
]. Some have even argued that δ-containing GABA
A
R are the preferred, if not the only, site of action for neurosteroids in the physiological concentration range [
39
,
40
,
41
]. Rodent studies have shown that δ subunit expression in the brain is regulated by reproductive events [
12
,
13
,
16
]. Regulatory effects seem to be directly mediated by ALLO (and not progesterone), as regulation of the δ subunit can be inhibited by application of finasteride (which blocks the conversion of progesterone to ALLO) and is unaffected by mifepristone (a progesterone receptor antagonist) [
13
]. Studies have found that down-regulation of δ-GABA
A
Rs occurs in the hippocampus and amygdala in the presence of chronically high ALLO levels, while up-regulation is seen upon steroid withdrawal [
12
,
13
,
16
]. Thus, δ-GABA
A
Rs are under constant dynamic modulation across the ovarian cycle, and deficits in this system (such as in δ−/δ− or δ+/δ− knock-out mice) are associated with increased neuronal excitability and anxiety [
12
,
13
]. Our finding of reduced δ subunit expression in women with PMDD may indicate an impaired up-regulation of δ-GABA
A
Rs in the context of ALLO-withdrawal in the late luteal phase. This is further supported by studies of GABA
A
R sensitivity in PMDD showing that PMDD women are less sensitive to low doses of ethanol and pregnanolone (the 5β-pregnane epimer of ALLO) in the late luteal compared to the mid-follicular phase [
19
,
42
]. Both ethanol and pregnanolone are thought to be particularly potent modulators of δ-containing GABA
A
Rs [
43
,
44
]. In contrast, women with PMDD have previously been shown to be more sensitive to supraphysiological doses of ALLO in the luteal phase [
45
]. However, supraphysiological doses of ALLO also activate synaptic γ2-containing GABA
A
Rs [
7
,
37
], and differences in sensitivity between patients and controls in this context may thus be related to differential modulation of other GABA
A
Rs subtypes, which were unfortunately not detectable in the present study. Moreover, altered ALLO sensitivity in PMDD may be influenced by other factors that were not investigated in the present study. First, lower cerebral GABA levels in the luteal phase have been reported in women with PMDD [
46
]. Since neurosteroid efficacy at the δ GABA
A
R is dependent on ambient GABA concentrations [
47
], lower GABA levels may mediate a lower sensitivity to neurosteroids. Second, δ GABA
A
R tone may be influenced by altered neurosteroid metabolism and synthesis in the brain. While this has never been investigated in PMDD, reduced levels of ALLO in the cerebrospinal fluid is found in conditions with overlapping symptomatology, including depression, anxiety, and chronic stress [
48
,
49
]. Nonetheless, findings from studies of progesterone/ALLO withdrawal in δ-GABA
A
R-deficient rodents provides an interesting parallel with PMDD [
12
,
13
]. Inefficient regulation of δ-GABA
A
Rs in response to ALLO fluctuations may thus be an important mechanism underlying the susceptibility of PMDD women to experience severe symptoms in response to ovarian hormone fluctuations.
Remarkably, we found that lower δ subunit expression was associated with increased activity in the basolateral amygdala. This is particularly pertinent to explaining the mood symptoms of PMDD as the amygdala is thought to signal salience and novelty of stimuli and participates in the generation of emotion [
50
,
51
,
52
]. Furthermore, amygdala hyperactivity has been found to be a transdiagnostic feature of multiple psychiatric disorders, including anxiety and depressive disorders [
53
], and is thought to mediate exaggerated and inappropriate reactivity to stimuli [
54
]. One of the most consistent findings in neuroimaging studies of PMDD is that amygdala activity is increased in the luteal phase [
55
]. One early fMRI study, albeit in healthy women, could show that exogenous administration of progesterone resulting in luteal-phase ALLO levels could selectively enhance amygdala activity in response to emotional stimuli [
56
]. In addition, we have previously shown that activity in the basolateral amygdala is differentially associated with ISO/ALLO levels in PMDD, as compared to control women [
21
]. δ-GABA
A
Rs are expressed in the amygdala, although their precise location seems to be species-specific. Indeed, they are found most abundantly in the intercalated cell masses in mouse [
57
] and in the basolateral amygdala in the rhesus monkey [
58
]. Histochemical stains of δ subunits in the human brain are not available. Nonetheless, a study in mice showed that ALLO influences neural activity in the basolateral amygdala, and that this effect was mediated by δ-GABA
A
Rs [
59
]. In the same study, ALLO-induced modulation of the basolateral amygdala related to anxiety expression [
59
]. The amygdala may thus be a key region mediating ALLO’s modulatory effects on mood, through its actions on δ-GABA
A
Rs. However, it is important to note that δ-GABA
A
R expression has been found to be altered in conditions of stress, psychiatric disorders, alcohol abuse, and reproductive events in other regions of the brain, including frontal regions and hippocampus [
9
,
13
,
40
,
60
]. Further investigations should attempt to determine the behavior consequences of altered expression of δ-GABA
A
R in other brain regions, and in relation to other important modulators such as stress, to gain a better understanding of the neuropsychopathology of PMDD.
The significance of differential β subunit expression in PMDD is not clear. The isoform of the β subunit is not thought to affect neurosteroid modulation of GABA
A
R function [
7
,
61
]. However, functional GABA
A
Rs require the inclusion of β subunits, and β3 seems to be particularly important for inhibitory transmission - at least in the hippocampus - as evidenced by significant reductions in inhibitory currents following knock-out of β3 in mice, but not deletion of β1 or β2 [
62
]. Furthermore, neurosteroid-dependent phosphorylation of the β3 subunit via membrane progesterone receptors promotes GABA
A
R insertion in the cell membrane leading to increased tonic inhibition [
63
,
64
]. In addition, the β3 subunit has been demonstrated to be strictly required for spontaneous gating of the GABA
A
R, which results in neuronal inhibitory currents independent of GABA [
65
]. Higher β3 expression in the luteal phase in controls may thus contribute to reduced neuronal excitability in these women. Conversely, an altered proportion of β2/β3 subunit in GABA
A
Rs in PMDD indicates further abnormalities in GABA
A
R plasticity, which possibly confer reduced GABAergic tone in the luteal phase.
Our findings must be considered in light of the following limitations. The first, and most important, is that we base our discussion about GABA
A
R subunit expression on measures of mRNA levels in PBMCs. However, a myriad of posttranslational mechanisms contribute to poor observed correspondence between mRNA levels and functional proteins [
66
]. This might also explain why we did not find significant relationships between serum levels of ALLO and GABA
A
R subunits. However, genes that are differentially expressed (in our case between menstrual cycle phases, and between patients and control) may correlate better to their protein product [
66
]. Nonetheless, studies which also examine GABA
A
R subunit protein expression are necessary to determine whether subunits are truly differentially expressed in PMDD. A second limitation is that we do not know whether GABA
A
R subunit mRNAs in PBMCs is related to expression in the brain. However, altered gene expression in PBMCs has been shown to reflect brain changes following maternal separation in rodents [
67
]. In humans, PBMC gene expression (amongst which, genes coding for GABA
A
receptor subunits) has been used to successfully predict onset and progression of PTSD in trauma-survivors [
68
]. Changes in PBMC gene expression may thus provide some clues about transcriptional changes in the brain. A third limitation is that mRNA levels of GABA
A
R subunits in our samples were low, and many PCR cycles (>35) were required for detection. This meant that standard deviations of Ct values among replicates were relatively high, and for most subunits, mRNA levels were undetectable. The variability of our data is problematic and may have influenced our results. Lastly, mood symptom ratings were averaged from screening cycles and not collected during actual scanning days. This might have influenced our null finding in relating symptom severity to GABA
A
R subunit expression.
In conclusion, our study is the first quantification of gene expression of GABA
A
R subunits in women with PMDD. We found evidence of reduced δ subunit expression in PMDD women, which was related to increased reactivity to emotional stimuli in the amygdala. Abnormal regulation of δ-containing GABA
A
R by ALLO in the amygdala might be an important pathophysiological mechanism by which symptoms in the luteal phase are elicited. Pharmacological studies using drugs which specifically target δ GABA
A
R receptors may provide interesting insights into how modulation of this receptor correlates to behavioral change in PMDD.
