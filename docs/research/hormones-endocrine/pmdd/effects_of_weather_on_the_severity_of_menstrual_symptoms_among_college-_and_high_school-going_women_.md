## Abstract
The effects of weather on the severity of menstrual symptoms have been a topic of interest and research for many years. While some studies have shown a correlation between weather conditions and increased severity of menstrual symptoms, others have found no significant relationship. The current study aimed to assess the effects of weather on the severity of menstrual symptoms among women going to college and high school in the southern regions of Saudi Arabia. A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted targeting all women going to college and high school in southern regions of Saudi Arabia. An online questionnaire was used for data collection. The data were entered and analyzed in IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, version 26 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY), and stored with no attempts to identify the participants. The study included 484 participants; most of them were 20-30 years old; 64.5% had regular menstrual cycles. It was observed that mood fluctuations, bloating, difficulty concentrating, breast pain, irritability, anxiety, social isolation, feeling tired, headaches, and mood changes are all affected to some degree before and during menstruation. On the other hand, the amount of blood, duration of the course, physical activity during menstruation, nutritional habits, lower back pain, and sleep disorders showed varying percentages of impact. These findings provide valuable insights into the physiological and psychological changes that occur during the menstrual cycle. In conclusion, the relationship between weather and the severity of menstrual symptoms is a complex and multifaceted topic. While some women may perceive a correlation between certain weather conditions and an increase in symptom severity, the scientific evidence in support of this connection is still limited and inconclusive. Further research is needed to better understand the underlying mechanisms and to provide evidence-based recommendations for managing menstrual symptoms in relation to weather conditions.
