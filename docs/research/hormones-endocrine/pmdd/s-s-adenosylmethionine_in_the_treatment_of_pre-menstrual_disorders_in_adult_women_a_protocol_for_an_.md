## Abstract
Pre-menstrual disorders, including pre-menstrual syndrome and pre-menstrual dysphoric disorder, are highly prevalent disorders in women of reproductive age. Pre-menstrual disorders are associated with debilitating symptoms that onset in the days prior to menses. A complex interplay between hormonal fluctuations, cellular sensitivity, and psychosocial stressors likely underly the pathophysiology of pre-menstrual disorders. Current treatment options include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, hormonal therapies, and psychosocial support. There is growing evidence for oestrogen, progesterone, gonadotropin Releasing Hormone analogues and Complementary and Alternative Medicines in treating Pre-menstrual disorders. (S)-S-adenosylmethionine is a complementary and alternative medicine with postulated roles in the treatment of depression, with a rather rapid onset of action and minimal side effect profile. We propose a protocol for investigating the efficacy of (S)-S-adenosylmethionine in the treatment of pre-menstrual disorders. The proposed study is an open label pilot study, that will recruit thirty women between the ages of 18-45 who experience a pre-menstrual disorder. Daily and interval questionnaires will provide a quantification of symptoms across four menstrual cycles (16 weeks). During two consecutive menstrual cycles it is proposed that participants receive oral (S)-S-adenosylmethionine Complex 400 mg three times a day (total daily dose 1200 mg), during the pre-menstrual time-period (14 days prior to menses). Changes in pre-menstrual disorder symptoms between control and treatment cycles will assist in elucidating the clinical efficacy of (S)-S-adenosylmethionine. This study has the potential to support a larger double blinded, placebo controlled randomised control trial and aims to enrich the knowledge surrounding pre-menstrual disorders.
