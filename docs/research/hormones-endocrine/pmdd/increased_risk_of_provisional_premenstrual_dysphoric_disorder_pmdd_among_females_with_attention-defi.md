## Abstract
Due to historical under-recognition of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) among girls and women, little is known about female-specific factors that may affect individuals with ADHD, including those related to changes in ovarian hormones (e.g. across the menstrual cycle). We investigated whether females with a self-reported clinical diagnosis of ADHD are more likely to experience premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD). We also examined associations between PMDD and ADHD defined by a symptom and impairment threshold. Participants were aged between 18 and 34 years, were assigned female at birth and were recruited via Prolific.com ( The prevalence of provisional PMDD was elevated among individuals with a self-reported clinical ADHD diagnosis (31.4%), and among participants with ASRS-based ADHD (41.1%), compared with the non-ADHD reference group (9.8%). Individuals with ASRS-based ADHD and depression and/or anxiety diagnoses were at highest risk for provisional PMDD (relative risk 4.53 [3.10, 6.61]) compared with the non-ADHD reference group. Clinicians should be aware that individuals with a diagnosis of ADHD, or with high ADHD symptom levels, and who have a menstrual cycle may be more likely to experience PMDD. Future research should investigate the underlying mechanisms that link ADHD and disorders associated with hormonal sensitivity, such as PMDD.
