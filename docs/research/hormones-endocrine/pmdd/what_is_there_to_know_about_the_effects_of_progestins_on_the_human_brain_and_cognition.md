## Abstract
Progestins are an important component of hormonal contraceptives (HCs) and hormone replacement therapies (HRTs). Despite an increasing number of studies elucidating the effects of HCs and HRTs, little is known about the effects of different types of progestins included in these medications on the brain. Animal studies suggest that various progestins interact differently with sex steroid, mineralocorticoid and glucocorticoid receptors and have specific modulatory effects on neurotransmitter systems and on the expression of neuropeptides, suggesting differential impacts on cognition and behavior. This review focuses on the currently available knowledge from human behavioral and neuroimaging studies pooled with evidence from animal research regarding the effects of progestins on the brain. The reviewed information is highly relevant for improving women's mental health and making informed choices regarding specific types of contraception or treatment.
