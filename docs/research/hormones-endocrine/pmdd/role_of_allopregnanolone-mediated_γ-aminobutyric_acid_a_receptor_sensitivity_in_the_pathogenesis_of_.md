## Abstract
Premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) can be conceptualized as a disorder of suboptimal sensitivity to neuroactive steroid hormones. Its core symptoms (emotional instability, irritability, depression, and anxiety) are related to the increase of stress sensitivity due to the fluctuation of hormone level in luteal phase of the menstrual cycle. In this review, we describe the emotional regulatory effect of allopregnanolone (ALLO), and summarize the relationship between ALLO and γ-aminobutyric acid A (GABA
