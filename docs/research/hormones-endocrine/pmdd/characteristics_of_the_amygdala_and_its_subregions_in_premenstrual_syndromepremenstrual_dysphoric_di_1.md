## Abstract
Premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) is considered a severe form of premenstrual syndrome (PMS). As a key brain region involved in emotional regulation and stress responses, the amygdala has been implicated in the pathogenesis of PMS/PMDD. The amygdala is composed of multiple subregions, each playing distinct roles in emotion, memory, and stress responses, and forms complex brain areas. Summarizing the interconnections among amygdala, subregions and their connectivity with external areas, and exploringt the neuroimaging characteristics of the amygdala, as well as changes in its neural circuits and brain networks in these patients, will help provide a theoretical foundation for targeted modulation of amygdala function in the treatment of PMS/PMDD. 经前烦躁障碍症(premenstrual dysphoric disorder，PMDD)被认为是经前期综合征(premenstrual syndrome，PMS)的严重类型。杏仁核作为情绪调节和应激反应的关键脑区，其功能异常与PMS/PMDD的发生密切相关。杏仁核由多个亚区构成，各亚区在情绪、记忆和应激反应中发挥不同功能，并与多个外部脑区形成复杂的神经连接。总结杏仁核各亚区的相互联系以及与外部区域的连接特点，探讨PMS/PMDD患者杏仁核影像学特征及其神经回路和大脑网络的变化，有助于为靶向调节杏仁核功能治疗PMS/PMDD提供理论依据。.
