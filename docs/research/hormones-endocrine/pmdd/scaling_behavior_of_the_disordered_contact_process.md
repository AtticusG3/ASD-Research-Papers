## Abstract
The one-dimensional contact process with weak to intermediate quenched disorder in its transmission rates is investigated via quasi-stationary Monte Carlo simulation. We address the contested questions of both the nature of dynamical scaling, conventional or activated, as well as of universality of critical exponents by employing a scaling analysis of the distribution of lifetimes and the quasi-stationary density of infection. We find activated scaling to be the appropriate description for all disorder strengths considered. Critical exponents are disorder dependent and approach the values expected for the limit of strong disorder as predicted by strong-disorder renormalization group analysis of the process. However, even for the strongest disorder under consideration no strong-disorder exponents are found.
