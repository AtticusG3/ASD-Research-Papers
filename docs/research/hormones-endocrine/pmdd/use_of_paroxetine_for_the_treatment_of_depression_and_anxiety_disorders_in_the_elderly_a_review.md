## Abstract
Paroxetine is a potent selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) with indications for the treatment of depression, obsessive- compulsive disorder, panic disorder and social phobia. It is also used in the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, premenstrual dysphoric disorder and chronic headache. There is wide interindividual variation in the pharmacokinetics of paroxetine in adults as well as in the elderly with higher plasma concentrations and slower elimination noted in the latter. Elimination is also reduced in severe renal and hepatic impairment, however, serious adverse events are extremely rare even in overdose. A Pub Med search was used to collect information on the efficacy and tolerability in elderly patients. There are few studies of depression in the elderly and only one study in the old-old. In anxiety disorders including general anxiety disorder, panic disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder and social anxiety, there are no studies at all in the elderly. However, the safety of the drug allows its prescription in the elderly. In summary, paroxetine is well tolerated in the treatment of depression in those between the ages of 65 and 75, although few studies have examined its use in those of 75 and older.
