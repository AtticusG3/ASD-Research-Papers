## Abstract
Heart rate variability biofeedback (HRVB) is a well-studied intervention known for its positive effects on emotional, cognitive, and physiological well-being, including relief from depressive symptoms. However, its practical use is hampered by high costs and a lack of trained professionals. Smartphone-based HRVB, which eliminates the need for external devices, offers a promising alternative, albeit with limited research. Additionally, premenstrual symptoms are highly prevalent among menstruating individuals, and there is a need for low-cost, accessible interventions with minimal side effects. With this pilot study, we aim to test, for the first time, the influence of smartphone-based HRVB on depressive and premenstrual symptoms, as well as anxiety/stress symptoms and attentional control. Twenty-seven participants with above-average premenstrual or depressive symptoms underwent a 4-week photoplethysmography smartphone-based HRVB intervention using a waitlist-control design. Laboratory sessions were conducted before and after the intervention, spaced exactly 4 weeks apart. Assessments included resting vagally mediated heart rate variability (vmHRV), attentional control via the revised attention network test (ANT-R), depressive symptoms assessed with the BDI-II questionnaire, and stress/anxiety symptoms measured using the DASS questionnaire. Premenstrual symptomatology was recorded through the PAF questionnaire if applicable. Data analysis employed linear mixed models. We observed improvements in premenstrual, depressive, and anxiety/stress symptoms, as well as the Executive Functioning Score of the ANT-R during the intervention period but not during the waitlist phase. However, we did not find significant changes in vmHRV or the Orienting Score of the ANT-R. These findings are promising, both in terms of the effectiveness of smartphone-based HRVB and its potential to alleviate premenstrual symptoms. Nevertheless, to provide a solid recommendation regarding the use of HRVB for improving premenstrual symptoms, further research with a larger sample size is needed to replicate these effects.
