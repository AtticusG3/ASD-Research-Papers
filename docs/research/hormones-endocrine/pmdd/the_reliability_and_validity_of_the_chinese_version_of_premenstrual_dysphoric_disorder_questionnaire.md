## Abstract
Premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) seriously affects women's work and life, and early screening and diagnosis of PMDD can improve the quality of life of potential PMDD patients. The Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder Questionnaire for DSM-5 (CTDP-DSM-5) is a validated screening tool for PMDD based on the DSM-5. This study intends to conduct reliability testing and validity evaluation of the scale after translation and revision in Chinese women. 669 Chinese female college students were evaluated by a set of questionnaires including the Chinese version of CTDP-DSM-5 (CTDP-C), Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), General Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) and Premenstrual Symptoms Screening Tool (PSST). CTDP-C is a bi-dimensional screening instrument with 25 items. The factor structure of the CTDP-C fits well to the factor model of the original Spanish version (CFI = 0.957; TLI = 0.953; RMSEA = 0.036; Ï‡ CTDP-C has good validity and reliability and it is an effective screening tool to identify Chinese patients with PMDD among college students, providing a basis for early detection, early diagnosis and early treatment of PMDD.
