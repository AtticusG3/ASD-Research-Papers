## Abstract
Premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) is a mood disorder characterized with physical and affective symptoms during the luteal phase of susceptible women. The aim of this study was to investigate the association of Dopamine D3 receptor (DRD3) polymorphism, and Cannabinoid receptor Type 1 (CNR1) polymorphism with PMDD. Fifty one participants with documented PMDD according to the DSM IV criteria and 51 healthy controls were included in this cross sectional study. Symptom severity was measured with daily self-rating, monthly premenstrual assessment forms and psychiatric interviews. The genotyping of DRD3 receptor and Cannabinoid type 1 receptors were performed using Taqmanfluorogenic assay method. Distribution of DRD3 and CNR1 polymorphism was not different between patients and controls. These findings do not support a major role of DRD3, and CNR1 polymorphisms in contributing to susceptibility to premenstrual dysphoric disorder.
