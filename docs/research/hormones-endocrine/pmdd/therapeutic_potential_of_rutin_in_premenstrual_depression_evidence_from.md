## Abstract
Premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) is a cyclical mood disorder that severely affects the daily life of women of reproductive age. Most of the medications being used clinically have limitations such as low efficacy, side effects, and high cost, so there is an urgent need to discover safer and more effective medications. Rutin is a natural flavonol glycoside with various pharmacological properties including antidepressant. The study of the efficacy and mechanism of action of rutin in PMDD-depressed subtype model rats plays an important role in the discovery of new drugs for the treatment of PMDD. Binding of rutin to gamma-aminobutyric acid type A receptors (GABA The docking score of rutin with the GABA Overall, rutin alleviated depressed mood, memory impairment and social impairment in PMDD-depressed subtype rats, which may be related to binding to GABA
