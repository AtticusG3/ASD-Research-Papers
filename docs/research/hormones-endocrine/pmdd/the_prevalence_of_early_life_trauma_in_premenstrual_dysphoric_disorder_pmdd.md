## Abstract
Early life trauma is a risk factor for many mental disorders; however, there is a lack of research exploring early life trauma in Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder (PMDD), a debilitating form of Premenstrual Syndrome (PMS). This descriptive study aimed to determine the prevalence of early life trauma in women with PMDD and characterise type and age of trauma experience. Data for 100 women diagnosed with PMDD was extracted from the Monash Alfred Women's Mental Health Clinic Database. Experience of early life trauma was subclassified into four types (Physical abuse, sexual abuse, emotional abuse and/or neglect) and four age groups (0-5, 6-10, 11-14 and/or 15-18 years old). Prevalence of early life trauma was calculated and compared with Australian population estimates. Eighty-three percent of women with PMDD had experienced early life trauma, with emotional abuse being the most common (71%). All types of trauma were more common amongst PMDD women than the general Australian population. Trauma prevalence was similar across the four age groups, ranging from 59 to 66%. Of note, 51.8% women experienced trauma across all age groups. Our results suggest a strong association between early life trauma and PMDD. Emotional abuse and/or chronic trauma across childhood may be most strongly associated with PMDD.
