## Abstract
Premenstrual dysphoric disorder is a mood disorder that has been recognized in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) as a subcategory of depressive disorders. The disorder has a high prevalence rate, and yet no uniform measure is standardized on the Indian population. This study aimed to develop a scale to assess premenstrual dysphoric disorder that can be used for screening and for clinical use and that is standardized on the Indian population. This study used cross-sectional research design and collected data through social media platforms from a sample of 300 females, out of which 38 were excluded for pregnancy, mental health conditions, substance use, and oral contraceptive use. The scale was analyzed using SPSS 21.0 for descriptive statistics, internal consistency, and convergent, content (factor analysis), and divergent validity. Results showed a high reliability of 0.90 and a concurrent validity of 0.76 and 0.64 against PSTT and BDI. Factor analysis revealed four factors, namely, affective and cognitive functioning, daily life and occupational functioning, somatic symptoms, and interpersonal anger. The sensitivity and specificity of the scale were found to be 86 (86%) and 66 (66%), respectively. The scale developed in this study was found reliable and valid for use on the Indian population. It has high sensitivity and can be used as a screening measure for premenstrual dysphoric disorder.
