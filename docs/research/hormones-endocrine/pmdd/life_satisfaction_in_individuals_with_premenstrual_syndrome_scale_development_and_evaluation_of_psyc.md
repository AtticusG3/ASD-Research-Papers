## Abstract
Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) is characterized by various physiological and psychological symptoms occurring in the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle, which may negatively affect women's life satisfaction. Existing general life satisfaction scales are insufficient to assess the impact of PMS-specific multidimensional and cyclical symptoms. This study aimed to develop a valid and reliable life satisfaction scale specific to PMS and to identify the individual and environmental factors that influence this satisfaction. This methodological and cross-sectional study was conducted in two phases. In the first phase (n = 158), a scale development study was carried out; in the second phase (n = 379), the psychometric properties were evaluated. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses were used to assess construct validity, while Cronbach's alpha and McDonald's omega coefficients were calculated for reliability. In the second phase of the study, independent samples t-test, ANOVA, Cohen's d, eta-squared, and multiple linear regression analyses were performed. The 15-item scale with three subdimensions demonstrated acceptable fit indices (RMSEA = 0.078; X2/df = 1.96; CFI = 0.91; GFI = 0.88; AGFI = 0.83) and high reliability (α = 0.880; ꞷ = 0.885). Significant associations were found between life satisfaction scores and factors such as employment status, exercise habits, chronic disease diagnosis, and coping methods for PMS (p < 0.05). The PMS-Specific Life Satisfaction Scale is a valid and reliable tool that comprehensively evaluates the impact of PMS on women's life satisfaction and identifies key influencing factors. The findings suggest that lifestyle factors play an important role and can guide personalized care planning.
