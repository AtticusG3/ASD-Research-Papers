## Abstract
Introduction Suicidal ideation (SI), planning, and attempts have been found to be more common in women with premenstrual syndrome (PMS) and premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD). This study assessed the association between PMS, PMDD, and SI within the Makkah population, in Saudi Arabia. Methodology A descriptive cross-sectional study that simply characterizes the prevalence of a health outcome in a specified population was done on 733 women using an online questionnaire. Data about demographics, menstrual cycle, PMS, past psychiatric history, prior history of PMDD, and previous drug treatment for PMDD were collected. The chi-square and Fisher exact tests were applied. Results Of the participants, 540 (73.7%) had an age represented the age of 18-25 years old, 551 (75.2%) were single, 592 (80.8%) did not have children, 352 (48.0%) had a four-year college education, and 552 (75.3%) had a monthly income of less than 5000 SR. Exactly 704 (96.0%) were menstruating, 539 (73.5%) had regular menstrual cycles, 640 (87.3%) reported low shock trauma, 201 (27.4%) reported a history of anxiety, and 541 (73.8%) reported an impact of premenstrual disorders on mental health. Of them, 662 (90.3%) experienced premenstrual symptoms, 53 (7.2%) had a previous diagnosis of premenstrual symptoms, and 62 (8.5%) had a history of a suicide attempt. Those aged 18 to 25 years, who have no children, have a monthly income of less than 5000, are unemployed, have irregular menstruation, have medical interventions due to premenstrual symptoms, have a lifelong history of depression or anxiety, and have a history of high shock trauma had a significantly higher prevalence of a history of a suicide attempt. These factors were independent predictors on regression analysis. Conclusion The link between PMD and the likelihood of suicide attempts highlights how crucial it is to treat severe PMDs in the context of mental health.
