## Abstract
The female reproductive years are characterized by fluctuations in ovarian hormones across the menstrual cycle, which have the potential to modulate neurophysiological and behavioral dynamics. Menstrually-related mood disorders (MRMDs) comprise cognitive-affective or somatic symptoms that are thought to be triggered by the rapid fluctuations in ovarian hormones in the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle. MRMDs include premenstrual syndrome (PMS), premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD), and premenstrual exacerbation (PME) of other psychiatric disorders. Electroencephalography (EEG) non-invasively records in vivo synchronous activity from populations of neurons with high temporal resolution. The present overview sought to systematically review the current state of task-related and resting-state EEG investigations on MRMDs. Preliminary evidence indicates lower alpha asymmetry at rest being associated with MRMDs, while one study points to the effect being luteal-phase specific. Moreover, higher luteal spontaneous frontal brain activity (slow/fast wave ratio as measured by the delta/beta power ratio) has been observed in persons with MRMDs, while sleep architecture results point to potential circadian rhythm disturbances. In this review, we discuss the quality of study designs as well as future perspectives and challenges of supplementing the diagnostic and scientific toolbox for MRMDs with EEG.
