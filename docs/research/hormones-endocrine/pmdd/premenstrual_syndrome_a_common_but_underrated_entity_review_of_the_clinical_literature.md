## Abstract
Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) and premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) are characterized by somatic and psychologic symptoms that arise at the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle and subside with menstruation. For definitive diagnosis prospectively self-reported symptoms should demonstrate a cyclic pattern and other psychological pathologies and thyroid dysfunction, that may present with similar symptoms, should be excluded. Both entities affect millions of women at reproductive age as the prevalence of PMS is given as 10-98% while PMDD affects 2-8%. Sex steroids and neurotransmitters have a central role in the etiology. The role of vitamins and minerals in the etiology and treatment of PMS and PMDD is open to discussion. Drugs that suppress ovarian sex steroid production, such as combined oral contraceptives or selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors enhancing central serotonin delivery are used for treatment. Life-style changes and regular exercise also have a positive effect in milder cases. Tricyclic antidepressants and gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogues can be used in selected cases.
