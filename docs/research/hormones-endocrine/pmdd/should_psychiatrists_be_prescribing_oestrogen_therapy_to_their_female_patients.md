## Abstract
Some studies have indicated that oestrogen therapy may be beneficial in the treatment of a number of neuropsychiatric disorders. However, it has been suggested that psychiatrists fail to prescribe oestrogen therapy to their patients, as they are 'not aware of' or 'do not believe' studies supporting their use. This paper reappraises the putative role of hormone treatments, particularly oestrogen therapy, in psychiatry.
