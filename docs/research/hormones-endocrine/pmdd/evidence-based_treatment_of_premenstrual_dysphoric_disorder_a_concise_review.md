Premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) is a collection of physical, cognitive, and affective symptoms causing clinically significant distress or interference that occur in the 7 days prior to the onset of menses, after which they become minimal or absent. The diagnosis is established by symptom documentation using a validated, reliable tool such as the Daily Record of Severity of Problems (DRSP) for at least 2 menstrual cycles to confirm the timing of relevant symptoms. According to the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), there is a 1.8%-5.8% 12-month prevalence of PMDD among menstruating women1; however, the prevalence of premenstrual symptoms causing clinically significant interference or distress but not meeting full criteria for a diagnosis of PMDD may be as high as 13%-18%.
