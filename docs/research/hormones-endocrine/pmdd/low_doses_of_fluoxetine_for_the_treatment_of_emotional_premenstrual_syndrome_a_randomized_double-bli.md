## Abstract
The neuroactive metabolite of progesterone, allopregnanolone (ALLO), has been implicated in premenstrual syndrome (PMS) physiopathology and preclinical studies suggested that low doses of fluoxetine increase the ALLO brain concentration. To assess which low dose of fluoxetine (2 mg/d, 5 mg/d or 10 mg/d), administered exclusively during the luteal phase of menstrual cycle, has a potential effect for preventing or mitigating emotional PMS symptoms. In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled pilot study, we followed 40 women (mean age = 29.7 +/- 7.4 years) with emotional PMS, during two menstrual cycles: cycle 1, without pharmacological intervention; and cycle 2, with pharmacological intervention. Participants took capsules, on average, seven days preceding the likely date of menses. We assessed the severity of PMS symptoms in both cycles using the Daily Record of Severity of Problems scale (DRSP). There was an increase in the DRSP scores during the late luteal phase of cycle 1, confirming the diagnosis of emotional PMS. Low doses of fluoxetine (5 mg/d: 33.5%; 10 mg/d: 48.4%) reduced DRSP total score in the day before menses (day-1) at cycle 2 compared with day-1 at cycle 1. Fluoxetine 10 mg/d had the most consistent decline in emotional PMS symptoms; 70% of the participants reported a reduction greater than 40% in the DRSP score. Low doses of fluoxetine, which may have no or few effect on the serotonergic system, but may interfere in the progesterone metabolization, seem to have some potential to mitigate emotional PMS symptoms. While the 10 mg/d of fluoxetine had the best performance on reducing emotional PMS symptoms, the 5 mg/d dose also seems to have some effect on emotional PMS symptoms. Further larger studies will help establish the lowest effective dose of flouxetine for PMS treatment.
