## Abstract
Background Despite increasing recognition of the lived-experience of premenstrual distress (PMD), research into individuals' accounts of healthcare support for these conditions remains limited, particularly in Australia. This study aimed to qualitatively explore how individuals experience Australian healthcare support for PMD, with a focus on identifying helpful and unhelpful elements of care. Methods Qualitative data were collected through open-ended survey questions and one-to-one, in-depth interviews. Data were analysed using thematic analysis informed by The Listening Guide. Results A total of 106 survey respondents and 13 interview participants took part in the study. Participants' experiences of Australian healthcare support for PMD reflected four main themes. The comprehensive experience described helpful experiences with healthcare providers who offered validating, knowledgeable and holistic care. The reductionist experience described experiences with superficial solutions that failed to address the complexity of participants' experiences. The uninformed experience described experiences with healthcare providers who lacked awareness or understanding of PMD. The dismissed experience described experiences where participants' concerns were minimised or invalidated by their healthcare providers. Conclusions Findings highlight both the presence of affirming care and the persistence of dismissive and inadequate responses within the Australian healthcare system. These results underscore the need for improved clinician education, trauma-informed and person-centred approaches, and a broader range of care options that are responsive to the complexity of PMD experiences.
