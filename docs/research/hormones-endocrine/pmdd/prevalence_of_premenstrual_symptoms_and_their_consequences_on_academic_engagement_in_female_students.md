## Abstract
Introduction Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) and premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) are conditions marked by a range of emotional, behavioral, and physical symptoms that can interfere with daily functioning. Among college students, who are already navigating academic pressure and lifestyle transitions, these symptoms may significantly influence well-being and engagement. Objective The objective of the study is to determine the prevalence and severity of PMS and PMDD among female college students and assess their impact on academic performance and engagement. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted on 227 female students (18-25 years) from Dr. S. N. Medical College, Jodhpur, and affiliated colleges. Participants completed a validated premenstrual symptom questionnaire, and academic engagement was assessed through self-reported performance metrics. Statistical analysis included chi-squared tests and regression analysis; p-values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Results While no significant association was observed between PMS/PMDD severity and academic performance (χ² = 3.307, p = 0.191), severe PMS was significantly linked to emotional (anger, anxiety, and depression), behavioral (concentration issues, hypersomnia), and social factors (impact on family, social life, and responsibilities) (p < 0.001 for all). Conclusion Although academic performance remained unaffected by PMS and PMDD, these conditions significantly influenced the emotional and behavioral aspects of students' lives. This underscores the importance of psychological support and awareness strategies to promote student wellness.
