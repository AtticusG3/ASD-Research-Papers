## Abstract
The Neurobiology Of Thinking, Identity, And Geniality Abstract: Mathematically the axioms of representation are subtle, and critical. The CNS expresses its function via its internal neuronal networks in multidimensional, intrinsic frames. CNS operation can be represented by tensor transformations within and among general frames of reference. So-called metaorganization principle is transforming the dual representations of intention from one to another. The property of intentionality refers to the fact that consciousness is about objects or events, and is modulated by attention. To construct a new neural framework we must outgoing basicly from the competitive interactions among widely distributed groups of neurons. A major system in this regard is the thalamocortical system. The integrative dynamics of conscious experience suggests that the thalamocortical system behaves as a functional cluster that interacts mainly with itself.
