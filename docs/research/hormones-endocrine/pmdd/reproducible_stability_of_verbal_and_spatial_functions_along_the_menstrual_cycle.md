## Abstract
Recent studies have reported brain changes in response to ovarian hormonal fluctuations along the menstrual cycle. However, it remains unclear, whether these brain changes are of an adaptive nature or whether they are linked to changes in behavior along the menstrual cycle, particularly with respect to cognitive performance. To address this knowledge gap, we report results from 3 well-powered behavioral studies with different task designs, leveraging the advantages of each design type. In all three studies we assessed whether verbal or spatial performance (i) differed between cycle phases, (ii) were related to estradiol and / or progesterone levels and (iii) were moderated by individual hormone sensitivity as estimated by premenstrual symptoms. Overall, results of all three studies point towards a null effect of menstrual cycle phase and - to a lesser extent - ovarian hormones on verbal and spatial performance and provided no evidence for a moderation of this effect by individual hormone sensitivity. We conclude that there is substantial consistency in verbal and spatial performance across the menstrual cycle, and that future studies of intra-individual variation are needed.
