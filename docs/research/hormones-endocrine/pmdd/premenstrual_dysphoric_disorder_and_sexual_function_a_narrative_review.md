## Abstract
Premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) and female sexual dysfunction (FSD) are 2 prevalent illnesses in women that cause distress and affect quality of life. There are plausible biological, social, and psychological links between these 2 conditions. Nevertheless, few studies have examined sexual function in women with PMDD. In this narrative review we summarize the existing literature on sexual function in women with PMDD and with the broader diagnostic classification of premenstrual syndrome and discus the differences between PMDD and more general premenstrual symptomatology, as well as why studying sexual function specifically in PMDD is necessary. We explored reasons why these 2 illnesses may be comorbid and the importance of studying sexual function in this population of women. PubMed literature searches were conducted using relevant keywords. Currently, there are few studies examining PMDD and FSD, and the studies available have significant methodologic limitations. Investigation of sexual function in women with PMDD is needed. Awareness of the comorbidities for PMDD and FSD can allow implementation of targeted interventions for women suffering from these disorders.
