## Abstract
Menstrual disturbances are prevalent among young females worldwide. However, the literature addressing this topic in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) is scarce. This study aimed to measure the prevalence of menstrual disturbances among female university students across the UAE and identify the most common practices and lifestyle factors associated with menstrual disturbances. This cross-sectional study utilized convenience sampling and was distributed to female university students. The questionnaire was developed after a careful assessment of the literature and was conducted between February and March of 2023. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) criteria were used to evaluate the prevalence of premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) among the study population. Of the total 390 participants, 73.6% had at least one menstrual disturbance, with PMDD being the most common at 50.8%. Furthermore, PMDD was significantly associated with caffeine consumption (p = 0.047). Conditions such as oligomenorrhea (p = 0.005), hypomenorrhea (p = 0.021), and PMDD (p â‰¤ 0.001) were associated with higher stress scores. For managing menstrual disturbance, 71.5% did not seek professional advice, and only 7.7% of patients took prescribed medications. Most participants opted for self-management by bed rest (75.4%), consumption of tea and herbs (63.1%), and self-medication (54.4%). The prevalence of menstrual problems among female university students in the UAE was 73.6%, which was high, with higher stress scores being correlated with multiple menstrual disturbances; thus, awareness programs and the provision of proper counseling are recommended to all universities across the UAE.
