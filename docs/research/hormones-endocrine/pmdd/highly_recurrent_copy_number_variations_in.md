## Abstract
Although single-nucleotide polymorphisms in In this study, the occurrences of the recurrent CNVs esv2730987 in Intron 6 and nsv1177513 in Exon 11 of The results demonstrated that copy-number-gains were enriched in both SCZ and PMDD patients with significant odds ratios (OR). For combined-gender SCZ patients versus controls, about two-fold increases were observed in both ethnic groups at both esv2730987 (OR = 2.15, These findings established for the first time the association of highly recurrent CNVs with SCZ and PMDD, suggesting the presence of an overlapping genetic basis with shared biomarkers for these two common psychiatric disorders.
