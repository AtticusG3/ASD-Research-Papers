## Abstract
Most women in reproductive age experience at least one premenstrual syndrome (PMS) symptom every month over many years, and about 5% experience significant impairment, requiring professional intervention. Offering effective and sustainable treatment, is essential. While research acknowledges the effectiveness of nonpharmacological methods, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and lifestyle modifications, as a treatment alternative, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors or hormonal ovulation suppression continue to be recommended as a first-line treatment. We hypothesize that nonpharmacological methods will be sufficient for effective and sustainable PMS management. A systematic literature review was conducted for peer-reviewed original studies with the search terms: CBT, psychoeducation, PMS and premenstrual dysphoric disorder. All 32 identified studies found a significant reduction in PMS to complete remission with nonpharmacological interventions. No side effects were reported, and positive effect was sustained over time. Psychoeducational self-help packages, delivered with the affordance of modern technology, appeared to be enough for most women to manage successfully their PMS distress. Most severe PMS forms required one-to-one CBT. Nonpharmacological methods can be recommended as the primary mode for PMS management. More high-quality research is required, for developing personalized self-help packages, as well as the full use of modern technology for delivering the service.
