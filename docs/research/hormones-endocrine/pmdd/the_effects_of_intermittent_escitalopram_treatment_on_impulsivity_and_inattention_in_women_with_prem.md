## Abstract
Women diagnosed with premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) report significant symptom relief when treated with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, but few studies have addressed the possibility of capturing this effect in behavioral, laboratory-based tests. This study examined the effects of intermittent treatment with escitalopram (vs. placebo) on a behavioral measure of impulsivity and inattentiveness in women reporting high levels of premenstrual irritability and anger.
Participants (
In line with previous reports, escitalopram caused a significant reduction in self-rated irritability and anger in the luteal phase. When on escitalopram, the participants demonstrated a lower frequency of anticipatory responses and greater consistency in response speed in the CPT 3. With respect to self-reported impulsivity, participants reported higher levels of urgency and lower levels of sensation seeking in the luteal placebo phase versus the follicular phase.
The finding that escitalopram impacted the outcome of the CPT 3 test in women with premenstrual irritability highlights the possible role of impulsivity in this condition.
