## Abstract
Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) approaches are widely used by women with premenstrual syndrome (PMS) and premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD). This article provides a comprehensive review of the medical literature on clinical applications of CAM for these conditions. The information was collected via a Medline review dating back to 1966 and subsequent selected review of bibliographies from these articles for non-Medline referenced but relevant clinical studies. For many of the therapies discussed, there is a lack of conclusive evidence either confirming or refuting efficacy. For other therapies, including certain herbal and nutritional approaches, the use of exercise, and the use of mind-body approaches, there is substantial evidence of efficacy. This review will be relevant to the practicing clinician seeking to become aware of and to understand the relevance of the complementary/alternative therapies being used by his/her patients for PMS and PMDD.
