## Abstract
Allopregnanolone (3α, 5α-tetrahydroprogesterone) is an inhibitory neurosteroid synthesized from progesterone Adult male Wistar rats were used to study whether the prior administration of mifepristone would alter the effects of allopregnanolone in the elevated plus maze (EPM) and forced swim test (FST) was evaluated. 10 mg/Kg dose of allopregnanolone increased percent open arm entries in the EPM, whereas 3 mg/Kg dose of allopregnanolone decreased percent immobility in the FST. Mifepristone administration resulted in a U-shaped response in the FST (with 1 mg/Kg, s.c., decreasing the immobility time) without significantly impacting the behavior in the EPM. In combination studies, mifepristone blocked the anxiolytic and antidepressant effects of allopregnanolone. The current study provides evidence for the first time that progestin or glucocorticoid receptors are involved in the acute anxiolytic and antidepressant effects of allopregnanolone. Understanding the mechanism of action of allopregnanolone will help us design better therapeutic strategies to treat neuropsychiatric diseases such as depression and anxiety.
