## Abstract
Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) is a combination of physical, psychological and social symptoms in women of reproductive age, and premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) is a severe type of the syndrome, previously known as late luteal phase dysphoric disorder (LLPDD). Both syndromes cause symptoms during the two weeks leading up to menstruation (the luteal phase). Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are increasingly used as a treatment for PMS and PMDD, either administered in the luteal phase or continuously. We undertook a systematic review to assess the evidence of the positive effects and the harms of SSRIs in the management of PMS and PMDD. To evaluate the benefits and harms of SSRIs in treating women diagnosed with PMS and PMDD. We searched the Cochrane Gynaecology and Fertility (CGF) Specialised Register of Controlled Trials, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and PsycINFO for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in November 2023. We checked reference lists of relevant studies, searched trial registers and contacted experts in the field for any additional trials. This is an update of a review last published in 2013. We considered studies in which women with a prospective diagnosis of PMS, PMDD or LLPDD were randomised to receive SSRIs or placebo. We used standard Cochrane methods. We pooled data using a random-effects model. We calculated standardised mean differences (SMDs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for premenstrual symptom scores, using 'post-treatment' scores for continuous data. We calculated odds ratios (ORs) with 95% CIs for dichotomous outcomes. We stratified analyses by type of administration (luteal phase or continuous). We calculated absolute risks and the number of women who would need to be taking SSRIs in order to cause one additional adverse event (i.e. the number needed to treat for an additional harmful outcome (NNTH)). We rated the overall certainty of the evidence for the main findings using GRADE. We included 34 RCTs in the review. The studies compared SSRIs (i.e. fluoxetine, paroxetine, sertraline, escitalopram and citalopram) to placebo. SSRIs probably reduce overall self-rated premenstrual symptoms in women with PMS and PMDD (SMD -0.57, 95% CI -0.72 to -0.42; I SSRIs probably reduce premenstrual symptoms in women with PMS and PMDD and are probably more effective when taken continuously compared to luteal phase administration. SSRI treatment probably increases the risk of adverse events, with the most common being nausea, asthenia and somnolence.
