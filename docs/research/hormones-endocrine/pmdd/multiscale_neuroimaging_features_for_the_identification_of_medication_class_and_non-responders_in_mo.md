## Abstract
In the clinical treatment of mood disorders, the complex behavioral symptoms presented by patients and variability of patient response to particular medication classes can create difficulties in providing fast and reliable treatment when standard diagnostic and prescription methods are used. Increasingly, the incorporation of physiological information such as neuroimaging scans and derivatives into the clinical process promises to alleviate some of the uncertainty surrounding this process. Particularly, if neural features can help to identify patients who may not respond to standard courses of anti-depressants or mood stabilizers, clinicians may elect to avoid lengthy and side-effect-laden treatments and seek out a different, more effective course that might otherwise not have been under consideration. Previously, approaches for the derivation of relevant neuroimaging features work at only one scale in the data, potentially limiting the depth of information available for clinical decision support. In this work, we show that the utilization of multi spatial scale neuroimaging features - particularly resting state functional networks and functional network connectivity measures - provide a rich and robust basis for the identification of relevant medication class and non-responders in the treatment of mood disorders. We demonstrate that the generated features, along with a novel approach for fast and automated feature selection, can support high accuracy rates in the identification of medication class and non-responders as well as the identification of novel, multi-scale biomarkers.
