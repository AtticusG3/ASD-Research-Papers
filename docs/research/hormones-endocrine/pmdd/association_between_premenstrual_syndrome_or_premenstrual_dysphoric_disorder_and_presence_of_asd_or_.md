## Abstract
This retrospective study aimed to investigate the association between premenstrual syndrome (PMS) or premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) and the presence of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) or attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in adolescent females. While PMS and PMDD are well-studied in the general population, limited research exists on their prevalence and impact in adolescent females with ASD or ADHD.
Retrospective data collection was conducted using electronic medical records, covering 290 patients aged 10-19 years. PMS severity, depressive symptoms, and autistic tendencies were assessed using standardized tools, including the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology (QIDS) for depressive symptoms, Autism-Spectrum Quotient (AQ) for autistic tendencies, and a PMDD assessment scale for PMS severity.
The results revealed a significant association between moderate to severe PMS and ADHD (odds ratio [OR]: 2.43) as well as comorbid ASD + ADHD (OR: 3.27). In contrast, ASD alone did not exhibit a significant link to PMS severity.
These findings highlight the heightened vulnerability of females with ADHD or comorbid ASD + ADHD to premenstrual psychological distress, emphasizing the importance of early detection and intervention. The study underscores the need for tailored treatment strategies addressing the unique challenges faced by this population.

Abstract
Purpose
This retrospective study aimed to investigate the association between premenstrual syndrome (PMS) or premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) and the presence of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) or attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in adolescent females. While PMS and PMDD are well-studied in the general population, limited research exists on their prevalence and impact in adolescent females with ASD or ADHD.
Methods
Retrospective data collection was conducted using electronic medical records, covering 290 patients aged 10–19 years. PMS severity, depressive symptoms, and autistic tendencies were assessed using standardized tools, including the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology (QIDS) for depressive symptoms, Autism-Spectrum Quotient (AQ) for autistic tendencies, and a PMDD assessment scale for PMS severity.
Results
The results revealed a significant association between moderate to severe PMS and ADHD (odds ratio [OR]: 2.43) as well as comorbid ASD + ADHD (OR: 3.27). In contrast, ASD alone did not exhibit a significant link to PMS severity.
Conclusion
These findings highlight the heightened vulnerability of females with ADHD or comorbid ASD + ADHD to premenstrual psychological distress, emphasizing the importance of early detection and intervention. The study underscores the need for tailored treatment strategies addressing the unique challenges faced by this population.
Article highlights
ADHD and ASD + ADHD comorbidity increase PMS risk, with depressive symptoms playing a key role in symptom severity.
ASD is not associated with PMS severity, suggesting a limited influence of autistic traits on premenstrual distress.
ADHD predicts moderate to severe PMS, showing the role of attention and emotion dysregulation in menstrual symptoms.
Exploring mood regulation is significant for understanding PMS in ADHD and ASD populations.
Given the link between ADHD and PMS severity, proactive screening and interventions may reduce premenstrual distress.
