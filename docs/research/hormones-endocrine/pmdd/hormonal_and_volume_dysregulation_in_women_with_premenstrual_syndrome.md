## Abstract
Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) presents with emotional and physical symptoms. Although the emotional symptoms have been extensively studied, the pathophysiology of the fluid-retention symptoms is not currently known. We tested the hypothesis that the fluid regulatory mechanisms are disturbed in PMS. Nine regularly menstruating women with PMS were compared with 9 healthy age-matched women. Hemodynamic parameters and upright plasma volume shift (extrapolated from changes in hematocrit), plasma renin activity (PRA), and plasma aldosterone and sex hormones were measured at different times during the menstrual cycle. During the early follicular and the midluteal phases, the plasma volume shift, supine and upright PRA, and plasma aldosterone were similar in both groups, and none of the participants had edema. However, during the late luteal phase, ankle edema was present only in women with PMS, and their maximal plasma volume shift was lower compared with controls (11.7+/-1.3 versus 15.6+/-0.6; P=0.004). The area under the curve (estimates the amount of the total plasma shift during 30 minutes standing) was 300+/-28 and 406+/-16 in PMS and controls, respectively (P=0.01). PRA and aldosterone levels were higher during the late luteal phase in women with PMS compared with controls (supine PRA: 1.4+/-0.3 [PMS] versus 1.1+/-0.4 [control; P value not significant], upright PRA: 3.9+/-0.08 versus 1.6+/-0.3 ng/mL per hour [P=0.015], supine plasma aldosterone: 131+/-30 versus 68+/-17 pg/mL [P=0.09], and upright plasma aldosterone: 208+/-40 versus 102+/-16 pg/mL [P=0.03]). We, therefore, conclude that women with PMS have increased plasma fluid-regulatory hormones and disturbed fluid distribution only during their late luteal menstrual phase.
