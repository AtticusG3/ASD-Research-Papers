## Abstract
Menstrually related mood disorder (MRMD) is marked by severe affective symptoms in the late luteal phase of the menstrual cycle. We hypothesized that women with MRMD experience relative neuroactive steroid deficiency, specifically low allopregnanolone levels due to reduced conversion of progesterone, in association with the onset of affective symptoms in the late luteal phase. Nine subjects with MRMD and 14 healthy controls were studied. Daily Record of Severity of Problems was used to diagnose MRMD by DSM-5 criteria for premenstrual dysphoric disorder. Depression and anxiety symptom severity (16-Item Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology Self Report, Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-Item Scale) and levels of plasma neuroactive steroids by mass spectrometry were assessed at the mid-follicular, mid-luteal, and late luteal phases. Depression severity was greater in women with MRMD than healthy controls in the late luteal phase only, as expected. In the mid-follicular phase, the mean allopregnanolone level and allopregnanolone/progesterone ratio were higher in women with MRMD than healthy controls. There were no differences between groups in luteal phase allopregnanolone levels. Higher follicular phase allopregnanolone sulfate and allopregnanolone levels were associated with greater depression severity in the mid-luteal and late luteal phases and greater anxiety severity in the late luteal phase. Levels of allopregnanolone, which have antidepressant effects, were higher in the mid-follicular phase in women with MRMD compared to healthy controls. In MRMD, increased conversion of progesterone to allopregnanolone in the mid-follicular phase may be a compensatory response to luteal phase depression and anxiety, or increased allopregnanolone levels could paradoxically trigger depression and anxiety.
