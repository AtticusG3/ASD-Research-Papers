## Abstract
Premenstrual symptoms are characterized by unpleasant psychophysical symptoms that appear during the luteal phase before menstruation and interfere with a woman's quality of life. Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) is a pathological condition with premenstrual symptoms, of which premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) is a particularly severe psychological symptom. This study aimed to examine the gender differences in the diagnosis and treatment of PMS and PMDD among obstetricians and gynecologists (OB/GYNs) in Japan. Data were obtained from the survey conducted by the Japanese Society of Obstetrics and Gynecology. We used data from 1,257 of the 1,265 OB/GYNs who are engaged in PMS/PMDD practice and reported their gender. Multivariate regression analysis adjusted for propensity scores was performed. Female OB/GYNs were more frequently engaged in treating patients with PMS/PMDD than males [odds ratio (OR) 1.74; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.36-2.21]. With regard to the diagnostic methods, more female OB/GYNs selected the two-cycle symptom diary than males (OR 2.88; 95% CI 1.80-4.60). Regarding treatment, fewer female OB/GYNs selected selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors as their first-line drug (OR 0.39; 95% CI 0.17-0.89). Gender differences were found in the selection of PMS/PMDD diagnosis and treatment methods among Japanese OB/GYNs.
