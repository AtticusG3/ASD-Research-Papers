## Abstract
Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) is characterized by physical, cognitive, emotional, and behavioral symptoms that appear during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle, disappear after menstruation, and are recurrent in every cycle. PMS significantly affects the social and academic lives of adolescents, and historically, it has been neglected by healthcare professionals. We aimed to evaluate the current point prevalence of PMS in Turkish adolescents presented to a tertiary adolescent medicine clinic. Adolescent girls between the ages of 12 and 18 and who had regular menstrual cycles for at least three months without any mental or chronic illness were assessed. A clinic information form and the 'Premenstrual Syndrome Scale' (PMSS) questionnaire were completed. Those with a PMSS total score of more than 50% of the total score (>110 out of 220) were classified as PMS (+). Those classified as PMS were further classified as mild-moderate (score: 110-150) and severe (>150). The study included 417 adolescents. The point prevalence of PMS was found to be 61.2% (n:255). Of those with PMS, 49.4% had mild-moderate and 50.6% had severe PMS. The mean PMSS score was 154.56 ± 30.43 in the PMS group and 76.17 ± 20.65 in the non-PMS group (p<0.001). The mean age was 15.41 ± 1.3 years in the PMS group and 14.88 ± 1.35 years in the non-PMS group (p=0.029). None of the youth in our study applied to our clinic due to any premenstrual complaints. PMS is frequently observed in youth, as indicated by our study. Adolescents have little awareness of PMS and their need for healthcare services. During the evaluation of adolescents, it is important for health care providers to acquire knowledge regarding the features of menstrual cycles and conduct a comprehensive psychosocial assessment.
