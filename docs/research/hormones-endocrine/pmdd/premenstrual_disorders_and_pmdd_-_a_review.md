## Abstract
Defining, diagnosing and managing premenstrual disorders (PMDs) remains a challenge both for general practitioners and specialists. Yet these disorders are common and can have an enormous impact on women. PMDD (premenstrual dysphoric disorder), one severe form of PMD, has a functional impact similar to major depression yet remains under-recognised and poorly treated. The aim of this chapter is to give some clarity to this area, provide a framework for non-specialists to work towards, and to stress the importance of MDT care for severe PMDs, including PMDD.
