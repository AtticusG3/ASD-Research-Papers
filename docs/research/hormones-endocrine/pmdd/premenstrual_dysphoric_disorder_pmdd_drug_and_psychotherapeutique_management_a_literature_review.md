## Abstract
Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder (PMDD) was first recognised in July 2013 in the DSM-5 after a long journey to identify its existence. It was not until 1983 that the US National Institute of Mental Health determined research criteria for the study of PMS. In 1994, the term "premenstrual dysphoric disorder" (PMDD) replaced this term in the 4th edition of the Diagnostic System Manual (DSM). It was listed in the section "Mood Disorder Not Otherwise Specified" and remained under consideration until the DSM-5, in which it appeared in the depressive disorders section. The legitimisation of the psychiatric diagnosis as well as the determination of clear symptomatology criteria in 2013 opened up possibilities for management, development of clinical, pathophysiological, therapeutic and psychotherapeutic studies. This disabling disorder can affect personal, social, family and professional life. In 2019, the ICD-11 in turn introduced the diagnosis of premenstrual dysphoric disorder, which solidifies the recognition of the disorder. (I) to review the existing treatments, both medicinal and psychotherapeutic, and (II) to review their effectiveness. At the end of this work we will formulate recommendations for the management of these patients. A bibliographic search was carried out from 7 June 2021 to 7 July2021 on the databases (bases de données) Psychinfo APA, Scopus, PubMed, as well as the bases de données of the Cochrane organisation and the recommendation documents of the Haute Autorité de la santé. After an initial selection based on keywords, the full text of all articles were read to arrive at the final selection of 32 articles. Antidepressants and Cognitive Behavioural Therapies (CBT) appear to be the most commonly recommended treatments for PMDD. Other research shows the effectiveness of oral contraceptives including drospirenone. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) were identified as an effective treatment for PMDD. These data are consistent with the current etiological hypothesis of PMDD which has a negative impact of natural hormonal fluctuations on certain neurotransmitters. CBT showed positive results in reducing the functional impact of PMDD. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressants were reported to be first-line treatments for PMDD (sertraline 50-150 mg/d, fluoxetine 10-20 mg/d, escitalopram 10-20 mg/d, paroxetine 12.5-25 mg/d). Drospirenone (EE 3 mg and EE 20 mg/d 24 days of hormonal pills, 4 days inactive) appears to have been a first or second line treatment depending on the articles. Current results clearly point to the effectiveness of CBT in helping to reduce: functional impairment, depressed mood, feelings of hopelessness, anxiety, mood swings, sensitivity, irritability, insomnia, conflict with others, impact of premenstrual symptoms on daily life, intensity of symptoms experienced, and symptom handicap. CBTs could also become a first-line treatment if there were to be more evidence of their effectiveness. In the future, it would seem useful to offer a psychotherapeutic treatment that can be reproduced and to multiply research with a high level of scientific comparability in order to clarify the place of CBT in the management of PMDD. Research on the etiopathology of the disorder and the optimal drug regimen is still ongoing. There is a need to develop appropriate psychotherapeutic techniques to support and accompany these patients. In order to better evaluate treatments for PMDD, there is a need to homogenise studies on the subject at several levels: design, treatment doses, psychotherapeutic techniques, and evaluation measures. At present, some studies include both premenstrual syndrome (PMS) and PMDD patients. PMS and PMDD do not include the same symptoms, nor the same severity and potentially the same aetiology in the patients studied. In order to propose rigorous research that evaluates the effectiveness of treatments for PMDD and to properly support people with both these disorders, it seems essential to distinguish the two conditions. The role of the health practitioner is to be able to identify PMDD by differentiating it from other clinically related disorders. The patient must then be accompanied to make a choice of treatment adapted to her symptoms, their severity, her history, her plans for procreation, contraindications and her preferences. In 2021, the French National Authority for Health did not offer any guidelines or recommendations for the management of premenstrual dysphoric disorder. There is a need to develop research in France.
