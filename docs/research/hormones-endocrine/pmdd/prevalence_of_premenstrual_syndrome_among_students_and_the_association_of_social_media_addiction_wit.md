## Abstract
Considering that numerous adverse effects of social media addiction (SMA) share characteristics with premenstrual syndrome (PMS), this study aims to determine the prevalence of PMS and to investigate the relationship between SMA and the severity of PMS symptoms among students at Hamadan University of Medical Sciences. This descriptive-analytical cross-sectional study was conducted between 2023 and 2024, involving 380 students from Hamadan University of Medical Sciences situated within the university environment and its affiliated dormitories. Sampling was performed using a convenience approach, and participants who met the inclusion criteria completed demographic questionnaires, the Social Media Addiction Scale-Student Form (SMAS-SF), and the Premenstrual Symptoms Questionnaire (PSST). Data analysis was executed utilizing Stata version 13 statistical software, with a significance level set at less than 0.05. The results indicated that 73.68% of the participants were experiencing PMS, while 7.11% were diagnosed with Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder (PMDD). The prevalence of severe SMA among students was found to be 14.21%. Additionally, the findings demonstrated a significant correlation between increased dependence on social media and a higher incidence of PMS, with this upward trend achieving statistical significance (Chi-square for trend = 10.13, p-value = 0.001). Furthermore, multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that, after controlling for potential confounding variables, the adjusted odds ratio (AOR) for PMS in students with severe SMA was 5.35 times greater than that of students with mild SMA (p = 0.001). As the severity of SMA increases, the prevalence of PMS also rises. Given that PMS can significantly impact the quality of life and the educational and occupational performance of students, it is imperative to educate them on the appropriate use of social media. This education should focus on fostering effective management strategies, which can mitigate the adverse consequences associated with SMA.
