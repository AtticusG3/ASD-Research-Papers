## Abstract
Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) might become severe enough to interfere with normal interpersonal relationships. This study was planned to assess whether administration of vitamin D (200,000 IU at first, followed by 25,000 IU every 2 weeks) for a 4-month period might lessen the appearance and the intensity of mood disorders associated with PMS in young girls with severe hypovitaminosis D. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, INTERVENTIONS, AND MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: One hundred fifty-eight young girls (15-21 years old) with PMS-related severe symptoms of the emotional and cognitive domains and low serum 25-hydroxycholecalciferol (25-OH-D) levels (â‰¤10 ng/mL) were randomly assigned to two treatment groups and treated for 4 months with vitamin D (group 1; n = 80) or placebo (group 2; n = 78). Clinical and hormonal effects were compared between the two groups. In patients from group 1, levels of vitamin D reached the normal range (35-60 ng/mL) after the first month and remained stable throughout the whole study. At the end of treatment, anxiety score decreased from 51 to 20 (P < .001 vs baseline); irritability score declined from 130 to 70 (P < .001 vs baseline). Crying easily and sadness decreased by a score of 41 and 51 to a score of 30 and 31, respectively (P < .001). For disturbed relationships, the score decreased from 150 to 70 (P < .001). Conversely, no appreciable changes were noted in symptom intensity from patients of group 2. The frequency of adverse events (nausea and constipation) was not different between participants of group 1 and group 2. On the basis of the present findings, vitamin D therapy can be proposed as a safe, effective, and convenient method for improving the quality of life in young women with severe hypovitaminosis D and concomitant mood disorders associated with PMS.
