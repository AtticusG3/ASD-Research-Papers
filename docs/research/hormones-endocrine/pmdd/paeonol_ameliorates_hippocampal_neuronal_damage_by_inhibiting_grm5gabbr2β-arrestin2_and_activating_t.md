## Abstract
Premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) is a periodic psychiatric disorder with high prevalence in women of childbearing age, seriously affecting patients' work and life. Currently, the international first-line drugs for PMDD have low efficiency and increased side effects. Paeonol, a major component of the traditional Chinese medicine Cortex Moutan, has been applied in treating PMDD in China with satisfactory results, but the therapeutic mechanism is not fully understood. This study aims to evaluate the therapeutic effects and pharmacological mechanisms of paeonol on the main psychiatric symptoms and hippocampal damage in PMDD. We established a premenstrual irritability rat model by the resident-intruder paradigm and performed elevated plus maze and social interactions. And we employed the HE and Nissl staining techniques to observe the therapeutic effect of paeonol on hippocampal damage in PMDD rats. Subsequently, Elisa, qRT-PCR Array, Western Blotting, and cell models were utilized to elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms through which paeonol intervenes in treating PMDD. In this study, we demonstrated the therapeutic effects of paeonol on irritability, anxiety, and social withdrawal behaviors in rats. In addition, we found that paeonol significantly reduced the serum corticosterone (CORT) level, improved hippocampal morphological structure and neuron number, and reduced hippocampal neuron apoptosis in PMDD rats. Paeonol reduced GRM5, GABBR2, β-arrestin2, and GRK3 expression levels in hippocampal brain regions of PMDD rats and activated the cAMP/PKA signaling pathway. Inhibitor cell experiments showed that paeonol specifically ameliorated hippocampal injury by modulating the β-arrestin2/PDE4-cAMP/PKA signaling pathway. The present study demonstrates, for the first time, that paeonol exerts a therapeutic effect on periodic psychotic symptoms and hippocampal injury in PMDD through inhibiting GRM5/GABBR2/β-arrestin2 and activating cAMP-PKA signaling pathway. These findings enhance our understanding of the pharmacological mechanism underlying paeonol and provide a solid scientific foundation for its future clinical application.
