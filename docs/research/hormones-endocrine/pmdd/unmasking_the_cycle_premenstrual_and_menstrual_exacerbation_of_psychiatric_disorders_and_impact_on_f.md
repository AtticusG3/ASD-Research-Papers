## Abstract
Premenstrual and menstrual exacerbation of psychiatric disorders is a significant area of concern in female mental health. Many females experience a worsening of psychiatric symptoms in the premenstrual and menstrual phases of their menstrual cycle, including heightened anxiety, depression, irritability, and mood swings. These exacerbations are most commonly associated with premenstrual syndrome and premenstrual dysphoric disorder that are characterized by severe emotional and physical symptoms that interfere with daily functioning. The hormonal fluctuations during the menstrual cycle, particularly changes in estrogen and progesterone levels, are believed to play a pivotal role in these exacerbations. Psychiatric disorders such as depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia may be influenced by these hormonal changes, with many females reporting an increase in symptom severity during specific phases of the cycle. The mechanisms behind this phenomenon remain complex, with both biological and psychosocial factors contributing to the heightened vulnerability. Clinical management includes careful monitoring of symptom patterns in relation to the menstrual cycle, with treatment options ranging from lifestyle modifications and psychotherapy to pharmacological interventions such as antidepressants and hormonal therapies. Understanding the link between menstruation and psychiatric disorders is essential for improving diagnosis and tailoring effective treatment strategies for affected individuals.
