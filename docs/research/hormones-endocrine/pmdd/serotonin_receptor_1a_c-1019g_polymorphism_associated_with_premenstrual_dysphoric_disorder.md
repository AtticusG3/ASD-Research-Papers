## Abstract
To assess whether the G allele of the serotonin receptor 1A C(-1019)G polymorphism is associated with premenstrual dysphoric disorder. The study sample comprised 53 women with clinically diagnosed premenstrual dysphoric disorder (age range 27-46 years, mean 37.7 years) and 51 healthy control subjects (age range 22-48 years, mean 36.2 years). The serotonin receptor 1A C(-1019)G polymorphism was genotyped and compared between the two groups. In contrast to the postulated "high-risk" G/G genotype, there was a marked overrepresentation of the C/C genotype in the premenstrual dysphoric disorder group (P=.034; odds ratio 3.63, 95% confidence interval 1.22-10.78). The presence of at least one C allele was associated with a 2.5-fold increased risk of premenstrual dysphoric disorder (P=.053; odds ratio 2.46, 95% confidence interval 1.03-5.88). Our hypothesis that the high-risk G allele is associated with the occurrence of premenstrual dysphoria was not proved in this study. However, due to the increased prevalence of the C variant, we suggest that the C(-1019) allele may contribute to the risk of premenstrual dysphoria. II.
