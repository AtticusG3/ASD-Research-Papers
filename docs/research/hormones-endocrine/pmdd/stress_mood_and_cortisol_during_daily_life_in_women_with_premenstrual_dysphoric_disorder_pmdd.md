## Abstract
Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder (PMDD) is characterized by significant emotional, physical and behavioral distress during the late luteal phase that remits after menses onset. Outlined as a new diagnostic category in DSM-5, the mechanisms underlying PMDD are still insufficiently known. Previous research suggests that PMDD exacerbates with stressful events, indicating a dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. However, studies measuring stress-related processes in affected women in real-time and real-life are lacking. We conducted an Ambulatory Assessment (AA) study to compare subjective stress reactivity together with basal and stress-reactive cortisol activity across the menstrual cycle in women with and without PMDD. Women with current PMDD (n = 61) and age- and education matched controls (n = 61) reported momentary mood, rumination, and daily events via smartphones at semi-random time points 8 times a day over two consecutive days per cycle phase (menstrual, follicular, ovulatory, and late luteal). Twenty minutes after assessments participants collected saliva cortisol samples. Three additional morning samples determined the cortisol awakening response (CAR). Women with PMDD reported particular high daily life stress and high arousal negative affect (NA
