## Abstract
Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) is a common menstrual disorder that can significantly impact the physical, emotional, and social well-being of affected women. However, PMS remains a neglected problem in Afghanistan, with limited data on its prevalence and impact. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of PMS and the more severe premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) among female university students in Kabul, Afghanistan. Researchers conducted a cross-sectional study from April to October 2021 at four universities in Kabul. They included a total of 310 female students aged 15-35 years. After data cleaning, 44 participants were removed and 266 participants remained. Data were collected using a validated screening tool for PMS and PMDD, along with information on participants' sociodemographic and lifestyle factors. Statistical analysis was performed to assess the findings. The study found that 88.8% of participants screened positive for either moderate to severe PMS (27.1%) or PMDD (61.7%). There was a significant association between lower educational attainment and higher rates of PMS/PMDD. This study uncovered a high prevalence of PMS and PMDD among female university students in Kabul. These conditions significantly impact young Afghan women's health and well-being, but remain a neglected issue. Urgent action is needed to improve awareness, screening, and treatment access for premenstrual issues in Afghanistan.
