## Abstract
Premenstrual tension syndrome can vary in type and severity among females, potentially affecting their academic performance. This study aims to examine the prevalence and severity of premenstrual tension syndrome symptoms in female university students and their impact on academics. A cross-sectional descriptive study was conducted among female university students from Ras Al Khaimah, UAE over 6 months, from January 1, 2022 to June 30, 2022. The updated premenstrual tension syndrome self-rating scale questionnaire was used to assess the prevalence and severity of symptoms. A total of 251 respondents were included in the study. The chi-square test was used to determine the association between PMT and academic performance. The results showed that 78.9% of the participants experienced premenstrual tension syndrome, with 16.3% of them reporting premenstrual dysphoric disorder. The majority of participants reported mild to moderate symptoms, with anxiety and depressed mood being the most common psychological symptoms. In terms of behavioral symptoms, physical symptoms and feeling overwhelmed were the most prevalent. Furthermore, 90% of participants reported a negative impact on their academic performance, with paying attention in class being the most affected. The study also found that PMT disorder had a significant impact on physical activities and extracurricular activities. Our study showed a high prevalence of premenstrual disorders among female students and their influence on physical activity and extracurricular participation. The study highlights the importance of implementing therapies for PMT syndrome and providing support to improve academic performance and overall quality of life.
