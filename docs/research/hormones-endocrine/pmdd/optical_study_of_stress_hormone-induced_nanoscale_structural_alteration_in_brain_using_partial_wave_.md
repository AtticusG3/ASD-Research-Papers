## Abstract
Chronic stress affects nano to microscale structures of the brain cells/tissues due the suppression of neural growths and reconnections, hence the neuronal activities. This results in depression, memory loss and even the death of the brain cells. Our recently developed novel optical technique, partial wave spectroscopic (PWS) microscopy has nanoscale sensitivity, and hence, can detect nanoscale changes in brain tissues due to stress. In this study, we applied this technique to quantify the stress related structural changes in the corticosterone-treated mouse model of stress. Our results show that brains from corticosterone-treated mice showed higher nanoscale structural disorder in the hippocampal region as compared to the brain from normal (vehicle) mice. The increase in structural alteration correlates with the duration of the stress. We further quantified the relative changes and the spatial localization of these changes in this mouse model and found out that the maximum changes occurred nearly symmetrically in both regions of the hippocampus. The mRNA for stress-related genes, BDNF and TrkB were also significantly reduced in the hippocampus of corticosterone-treated mice compared to that in control mice. These results indicate that chronic corticosterone treatment induces nanoscale structural alterations in mouse brain that corresponds to the changes in stress-related gene expression.
