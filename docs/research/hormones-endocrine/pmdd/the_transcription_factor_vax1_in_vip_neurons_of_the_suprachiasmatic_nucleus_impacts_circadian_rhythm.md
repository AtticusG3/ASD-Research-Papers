## Abstract
The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) within the hypothalamus is a key brain structure required to relay light information to the body and synchronize cell and tissue level rhythms and hormone release. Specific subpopulations of SCN neurons, defined by their peptide expression, regulate defined SCN output. Here we focus on the vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) expressing neurons of the SCN. SCN VIP neurons are known to regulate circadian rhythms and reproductive function. To specifically study SCN VIP neurons, we generated a novel knock out mouse line by conditionally deleting the SCN enriched transcription factor, Ventral Anterior Homeobox 1 (Vax1), in VIP neurons (Vax1 We found that Vax1 Together, these data identify VAX1 in SCN VIP neurons as a neurological overlap between circadian timekeeping, female reproduction, and depressive-like symptoms in mice, and provide novel insight into the role of SCN VIP neurons.
