## Abstract
In the United States, depression is approximately twice as common among women as among men, across all age groups. This review examines gender differences in the epidemiology and clinical presentation of depression, and explores whether women respond differently than men to antidepressant medications. This is a selective review focusing on current issues in the management of depression, with particular attention to gender differences in the epidemiology, diagnosis, and treatment of the disease. Women are more likely than men to have atypical symptoms of depression (eg, hypersomnia, hyperphagia), to have comorbid anxiety disorders, and to attempt suicide. Women are also more likely to have seasonal affective disorder. Mood and anxiety symptoms that seem to be related to the menstrual cycle do not often represent genuine premenstrual dysphoria, but when premenstrual dysphoric disorder does occur, its impact on quality of life is similar to that of major depressive disorder. There is ongoing controversy about whether men and women respond equally well to antidepressant medications, and preliminary evidence suggests that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are more effective in the presence of estrogen. Depression affects about 10% of pregnant women. Antidepressant medication should be considered during pregnancy if depression is moderate or severe, or if withdrawal of maintenance medication is likely to result in recurrent depression. The potential benefits of using antidepressant medications in a pregnant or breastfeeding woman should be balanced against the potential risks to the newborn. Because of the risk of neonatal withdrawal syndrome, SSRIs should be used at the lowest effective dose during the third trimester of pregnancy and should be tapered before delivery. Continuing research is needed to determine how gender influences the risk, clinical presentation, and response to treatment of depression. Exploration of sex differences in animals and humans should aid in efforts to treat depression as an organic disorder rather than a psychological maladaptation.
