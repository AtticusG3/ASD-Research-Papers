## Abstract
Premenstrual dysphoric disorder, which affects 3-8% of women of reproductive age, is characterized by a combination of symptoms that may include depressed mood, irritability, anxiety and/or physical symptoms. These symptoms occur during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle, with remission generally occurring within 3 days after the onset of menses. Presently, treatment guidelines for premenstrual dysphoric disorder focus on lifestyle management and psychopharmacologic interventions, with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors being considered the first line of medication intervention. The US Food and Drug Administration and Health Canada recently approved paroxetine for the treatment of premenstrual dysphoric disorder. This article reviews the properties of this medication and its use in the treatment of premenstrual dysphoric disorder.
