## Abstract
Premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) and premenstrual syndrome (PMS) refer to physical, cognitive, or affective symptoms that arise in the late luteal phase and remit with menses. The present work is a clinically focused scoping review of the last twenty years of research on treatment for these disorders. A search of key terms using the PubMed/Medline, the Cochrane Library, Embase, and Web of Science databases was performed, and 194 studies of adult women met initial inclusion criteria for review. Research studies concerning medications, pharmacological and non-pharmacological complementary and alternative medicine treatments, and surgical interventions with the most available evidence were appraised and summarized. The most high-quality evidence can be found for the use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and combined oral contraceptives (COCs), with gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists and surgical interventions showing efficacy for refractory cases. While there is some evidence of the efficacy of alternative and complementary medicine treatments such as nutraceuticals, acupuncture, and yoga, variability in quality and methods of studies must be taken into account.
