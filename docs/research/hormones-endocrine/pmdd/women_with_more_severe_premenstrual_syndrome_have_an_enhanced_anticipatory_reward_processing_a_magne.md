## Abstract
Laboratory studies reveal that young women with premenstrual syndrome (PMS) often exhibit decreased reward processing during the late luteal phase. However, studies based on the self-reports find opposite results (e.g., higher craving for high-sweet-fat food). These differences may lie in the difference between the stimulus used and measuring the different aspects of the reward. The present study was designed to expand previous work by using a classic monetary reward paradigm, simultaneously examining the motivational (i.e., reward anticipation, "wanting") and emotional (i.e., reward outcome, "liking") components of reward processing in women with high premenstrual symptoms (High PMS). College female students in their early twenties with High PMS (n = 20) and low premenstrual symptoms (Low PMS, n = 20) completed a monetary incentive delay task during their late luteal phase when the premenstrual symptoms typically peak. Brain activities in the reward anticipation phase and outcome phase were recorded using the magnetoencephalographic (MEG) imaging technique. No group differences were found in various behavioral measurements. For the MEG results, in the anticipation phase, when High PMS participants were presented with cues that predicted the upcoming monetary gains, they showed higher event-related magnetic fields (ERFs) than when they were presented with neutral non-reward cues. This pattern was reversed in Low PMS participants, as they showed lower reward cue-elicited ERFs than non-reward cue-elicited ones (cluster mass = 2560, cluster size = 891, p = .03, corrected for multiple comparisons), mainly in the right medial orbitofrontal and lateral orbitofrontal cortex (cluster mass = 375, cluster size = 140, p = .03, corrected for multiple comparisons). More importantly, women with High PMS had an overall significantly higher level of ERFs than women with Low PMS (cluster mass = 8039, cluster size = 2937, p = .0009, corrected for multiple comparisons) in the bilateral precentral gyrus, right postcentral gyrus, and left superior temporal gyrus (right: cluster mass = 410, cluster size = 128, p = .03; left: cluster mass = 352, cluster size = 98, p = .05; corrected for multiple comparisons). In the outcome phase, women with High PMS showed significantly lower theta power than the Low PMS ones for the expected non-reward feedback in the bilateral temporal-parietal regions (cluster mass = 47620, cluster size = 18308, p = .01, corrected for multiple comparisons). These findings reveal that the severity of PMS might alter reward anticipation. Specifically, women with High PMS displayed increased brain activities to reward-predicting cues and increased action preparation after the cues appear.
