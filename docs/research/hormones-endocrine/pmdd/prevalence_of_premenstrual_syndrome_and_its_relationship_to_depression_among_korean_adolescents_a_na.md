## Abstract
To investigate the prevalence of PMS and depressive symptoms and to determine their association among Korean adolescent girls using a nationally representative cross-sectional survey. The Korean Study of Women's Health Related Issues (K-Stori)was used. Of the 3000 adolescent girls aged 14-17 years, the study subjects were 2970 girls after menarche. Depressive symptom was assessed with the PHQ-9. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to investigate factors associated with depressive symptom. The prevalence of PMS was 70.5 %. Irritability (43.8 %), abdominal bloating (32.8 %), and breast tenderness (27.5 %) were the most predominant symptoms. The prevalence of depressive symptom was 15.5 %. Girls with PMS were more likely to be depressed than those who did not experience PMS (OR, 1.70; CI, 1.31-2.20). BMI was not associated with depressive symptom. However, a significant association was noted between satisfaction with one's body image and depressive symptom. Ever-smokers were more likely to be depressed than never-smokers (OR, 1.64; CI, 1.10-2.45). PMS were significantly associated with depressive symptom. PMS should be taken into account in the management of depression. Our study emphasized the significance of a multidisciplinary approach.
