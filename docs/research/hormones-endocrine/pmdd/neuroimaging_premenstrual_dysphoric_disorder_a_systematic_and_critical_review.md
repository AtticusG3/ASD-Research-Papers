## Abstract
Endocrine organizational and activational influences on cognitive and affective circuits are likely critical to the development of premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD), a sex-specific hormone-dependent mood disorder. An overview of the anatomical and functional neural characterization of this disorder is presented here by means of neuroimaging correlates, identified from eighteen publications (n = 361 subjects). While white matter integrity remains uninvestigated, greater cerebellar grey matter volume and metabolism were observed in patients with PMDD, along with altered serotonergic and GABAergic neurotransmission. Differential corticolimbic activation in response to emotional stimuli distinguishes the PMDD brain, namely enhanced amygdalar and diminished fronto-cortical function. Thus far, the emotional distress and dysregulation linked to PMDD seem to be defined by structural, chemical and functional brain signatures; however, their characterization remains sparsely studied and somewhat inconsistent. Clear and well-replicated neurobiological features of PMDD are needed to promote timely diagnoses and inform development of prevention and treatment strategies.
