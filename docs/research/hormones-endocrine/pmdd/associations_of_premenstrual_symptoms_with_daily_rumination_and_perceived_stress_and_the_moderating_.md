## Abstract
Subthreshold premenstrual symptoms can be impairing even if the diagnostic criteria for premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) are not reached. Previous research suggests shared psychological risk factors without a clear differentiation of premenstrual syndrome (PMS) from PMDD. This study focuses on a sample with a wide range of premenstrual symptoms not reaching PMDD-criteria and aims to investigate within-person associations of premenstrual symptoms with daily rumination and perceived stress during the late luteal phase as well as cycle-phase specific associations of habitual mindfulness including present-moment-awareness and acceptance with premenstrual symptoms and impairment. Fifty-six naturally cycling women with self-reported premenstrual symptoms completed an online diary on premenstrual symptoms, rumination and perceived stress over two consecutive menstrual cycles, and baseline questionnaires on habitual present-moment-awareness and acceptance. Multilevel analyses revealed cycle-related variations in premenstrual symptoms and impairment (all ps < .001). Higher within-person levels of core and secondary premenstrual symptoms during the late luteal phase predicted increased daily rumination and perceived stress (all ps < .001) and increased somatic symptoms predicted increased rumination (p ≤ .018). Higher habitual present-moment-awareness was linked to lower premenstrual symptom and impairment levels toward the late luteal phase whereas higher habitual acceptance was associated with lower premenstrual functional impairment (p ≤ .015). Premenstrual symptom increases during the late luteal phase in women with PMS seem to be linked to increased daily rumination and perceived stress. Trait present-moment-awareness and acceptance in turn seem to reflect protective factors against premenstrual distress and may represent useful targets for interventions.
