## Abstract
Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) characterized by cyclic symptoms during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle, presents an uncertain etiology in adolescents involving hormonal fluctuations and serotonin-related neurotransmitters with a limited existing literature on the impact of oxidative stress. This study aimed to explore the potential association between PMS and oxidative stress in adolescents. In a cross-sectional study conducted at a university hospital, involving 45 adolescent girls aged 12 to 18, participants were categorized based on the presence or absence of PMS using the cut-off point of 110 on the PMS Scale developed by Gençdoğan. Oxidative stress was assessed through dynamic thiol-disulfide homeostasis. The shift from the balance towards disulfide form is associated with oxidative stress, whereas towards thiol it shows a greater antioxidant capacity. Thirty out of the forty-five participants were found to have PMS with a mean age of 15.5 years. The PMS group demonstrated a significant increase in antioxidant markers, specifically elevated native (631.6±57.55 vs 598.2±41.08, p=0.048) and total thiol levels (675.15±3.4 vs 639.3±44.9, p=0.031). Despite a significant increase in thiol, thiol to disulfide ratio was not found to be significant (p=0.849). Contradictory to other studies in adults, we have demonstrated an increase in the antioxidant markers in adolescents with PMS. Elevated antioxidant status in adolescents with PMS may be an adaptive response to acute cyclic inflammation in the adolescent period, which might decrease with the progression of age. Further research is needed to investigate the complex interaction between oxidative stress and PMS across different age groups.
