## Abstract
Neurosteroids are involved in the pathophysiology of many neuroendocrine disorders in women. This review describes recent advancements in pharmacology of neurosteroids and emphasizes the benefits of neurosteroid replacement therapy for the management of neuroendocrine disorders such as catamenial epilepsy (CE), postpartum depression (PPD) and premenstrual brain conditions. Neurosteroids are endogenous modulators of neuronal excitability. A variety of neurosteroids are present in the brain including allopregnanolone (AP), allotetrahydro-deoxycorticosterone and androstanediol. Neurosteroids interact with synaptic and extrasynaptic GABA
