## Abstract
Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) is a common condition affecting young women, characterized by emotional, behavioral, and physical symptoms. Stress is believed to exacerbate PMS symptoms, yet the relationship between stress and PMS remains underexplored in the Indian context, particularly among young women in urban areas like Ahmedabad. This study aims to assess the impact of stress on PMS among young women aged 18-21 years residing in Ahmedabad, Gujarat. A cross-sectional study was conducted among 473 young women aged 18-21 years in Ahmedabad, Gujarat, using a stratified random sampling technique. Data were collected using a validated questionnaire that assessed PMS symptoms and perceived stress levels. Statistical analysis was performed using chi-square tests to determine the association between stress and PMS. Participants found to have moderate to severe PMS were 167 (35.3%). The most commonly reported symptoms included irritability, fatigue, and breast tenderness. A majority (84.4%) of the participants were having moderate stress. A significant positive correlation was found between high-stress levels and the severity of PMS (p < 0.01). The amount of menstrual flow was found to be associated with PMS in this study. The study highlights the significant impact of stress on the severity of PMS among young women in Ahmedabad, Gujarat. Considering higher percentages of stress levels among participants, there is a need for stress management interventions to alleviate PMS symptoms among the study participants.
