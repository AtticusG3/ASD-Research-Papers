## Abstract

<jats:p>
            <jats:bold>Background:</jats:bold>
            Nutrition can influence the occurrence of Premenstrual Syndrome (PMS) symptoms such as depression and food addiction. However, there is insufficient evidence on how ultra processed foods (UPFs) characterised by high sugar, fat and additive content contribute to PMS symptoms.
            <jats:bold>Aim:</jats:bold>
            This study aimed to examine the relationship between UPF consumption and PMS symptoms including depressed affect, anxiety, fatigue, irritability, and pain severity among female university students.
            <jats:bold>Methods:</jats:bold>
            The study is cross sectional. It was conducted among 432 female students from Bandirma Onyedi Eylul University. The data collection tools included descriptive information form, UPF consumption frequency questionnaire, and the PMS scale. Numbers, percentages, mean, standard deviation and multiple linear regression analysis were used in the analysis of the data.
            <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold>
            In this study in Model 1 and Model 2 and Model 3 adjusted for confounding variables, an increase in UPF consumption was found to be associated with an increase in PMS scale subscale scores (p &lt; 0.05).
            <jats:bold>Conclusion:</jats:bold>
            This study shows that an increase in UPF consumption exacerbates PMS symptoms such as depression, anxiety, fatigue, irritability, depressive thoughts, pain, appetite changes, and sleep changes, except bloating. Given these results, limiting UPF intake and adopting a balanced diet rich in whole foods, fiber, and essential nutrients may help alleviate PMS symptoms. Future interventions should focus on dietary education and awareness programs to promote healthier eating habits among young women.
