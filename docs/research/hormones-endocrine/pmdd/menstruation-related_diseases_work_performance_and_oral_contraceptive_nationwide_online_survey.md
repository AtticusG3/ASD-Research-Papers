## Abstract
This study aims to compare the effect of Menstruation-related diseases (MRDs), including premenstrual syndrome (PMS), premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD), and dysmenorrhea, on work performance (WP). Besides, we investigate whether oral contraceptives (OCs) mitigate these impacts in the general population. The data from a nationwide online-based survey conducted in Japan were analyzed (N = 4,818). Regression analyses examined the relationship between MRDs and presenteeism or absenteeism and the mitigating effect of OCs. Population attributable fractions (PAFs) for severe work-functioning impairment were calculated model-based. PMDD most substantially increased the risk of presenteeism and absenteeism. The PAFs were significant for PMS and PMDD and approximate 15% in total. OCs significantly alleviated presenteeism only among women with PMDD. PMS and PMDD impaired WP more profoundly than dysmenorrhea. OCs mitigated MRDs' effect on WP in women with PMDD.
