## Abstract
Premenstrual syndrome(PMS) lacks a highly consistent and feasible animal model that aligns with diagnostic and therapeutic standards in both traditional Chinese medicine(TCM) and western medicine, resulting in a lack of reliable experimental carriers for studying its pathogenesis and pharmacological effects. This study aims to systematically analyze the biological implications of PMS from the perspective of the "disease-syndrome-symptom" correlation and establish preparation and evaluation methods for an improved animal model of this disease. Firstly, clinical symptom gene sets related to the Qi stagnation syndromes due to liver depression and blood stasis in PMS in both modern medicine and TCM diagnostic standards were collected through GeneCards, DisGeNET, Mala-Cards, and the System of Foundational Diagnostic Association(SoFDA) database, as well as published literature. Based on the interaction information between genes, a "disease-syndrome-symptom" correlation network of PMS was established. Based on data mining results, an improved rat model of PMS was prepared by combining chronic restraint stress with the classical progesterone-withdrawal mo-del to simulate emotional depression caused by external environmental stimuli during the clinical onset process, inducing pathological damage from both physiological and emotional dimensions. The evaluation of the improved model before and after modification included open field experiment scores, organ indices, ovarian pathological changes, serum levels of estradiol(E_2), follicle-stimulating hormone/luteinizing hormone(FSH/LH), 5-hydroxytryptamine(5-HT), dopamine(DA), norepinephrine(NE), as well as coagulation parameters and hemorheology indexes. By calculating the degree, betweenness, and closeness centrality of nodes in the "disease-syndrome-symptom" correlation network, 163 core genes with topological importance were identified. Further biological function mining results indicated that core genes in PMS mainly participated in the regulation of the "nervous-endocrine-immune" system and pathways related to circulatory disorders. Mapping analysis of clinical phenotype symptom gene sets suggested significant correlations between core genes in PMS and depressive symptoms and pain symptoms caused by blood stasis. Compared with the simple progesterone withdrawal model, rats subjected to combined injections and restraint stress showed more significant abnormalities in open field experiment scores, ovarian tissue pathology, serum neurotransmitter levels of 5-HT and DA, as well as serum hormone levels of E_2 and FSH/LH. The modified modeling conditions exacerbated the pathological changes in blood rheology, coagulation function, and red blood cell morphology in model rats, confirming that the improved rat model could characterize the "nervous-endocrine-immune" system disorder and circulatory system disorders in the occurrence and progression of PMS, consistent with the clinical diagnostic and therapeutic standards of both TCM and western medicine. The establishment of the improved rat model of PMS can provide a reliable experimental carrier for elucidating the pathogenesis of PMS and discovering and evaluating therapeutic drugs. It also provides references for objectively reflecting the clinical characteristics of PMS in TCM and western medicine and precision treatment.
