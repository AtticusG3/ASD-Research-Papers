## Abstract
To explore the pathogenesis of premenstrual syndrome (PMS), and the correlation between anger and depression and PMS of Gan-yang ascending syndrome (GYAS) and Gan-qi stagnation syndrome (GQSS) by detecting the neuro-reproductive hormones of PMS patients of GYAS and GOSS, thus providing theoretical reliance for diagnostic standards for clinical normative PMS. Using techniques such as HPLC, HPLC-MC, ELISA, and radioimmunoassay (RIA), levels of serum sex hormones (follicle stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, estradiol, progesterone, testosterone, and prolactin), plasma neurotransmitters (gamma-aminobutyric acid, beta-endorphin, glutamic acid, dopamine, 5-HT, adrenaline, and noradrenaline), neurosteroids (allopregnanolone, pregnenolone, and dehydroepiandrosterone) in the follicular phase and the luteal phase of PMS patients of GYAS (30 cases) and GQSS (30 cases) were detected, and compared with the healthy control group (30 cases). There was no statistical difference in either index of the follicular phase among the 3 groups. Compared with the healthy control group, the testosterone level in PMS patients of GYAS in the luteal phase showed increasing tendency (P > 0.05). The levels of dopamine and 5-HT of PMS patients of GYAS in the luteal phase were higher and the gamma-aminobutyric acid level was lower than those of the healthy control group (all P < 0.05). The levels of adrenaline and noradrenaline of PMS patients of GYAS and GQSS in the luteal phase were higher than those of the healthy control group (all P < 0.05). The levels of allopregnanolone and pregnenolone of PMS patients of GYAS and GQSS in the luteal phase were lower, and the dehydroepiandrosterone level was higher than those of the healthy control group (all P < 0.05). The ratios of dehydroepiandrosterone/allopregnanolone and dehydroepiandrosterone/pregnenolone of PMS patients of GYAS and GQSS in the luteal phase were higher than those of the healthy control group (P < 0.05). The decreased levels of pregnenolone and allopregnanolone, increased dehydroepiandrosterone levels, and increased ratios of dehydroepiandrosterone/allopregnanolone and dehydroepiandrosterone/pregnenolone might be one of biological factors for anger and depression in PMS patients of GYAS and GQSS.
