## Abstract
To investigate neural-reproductive hormonal basis of liver yang rising (LYR), liver qi stagnation (LQS) premenstrual syndrome (PMS), and to develop standardized diagnostic criteria for PMS. HPLC, HPLC-MC, ELISA and radioimmunoassay were used to compare levels of serum hormones, plasma neurotransmitters and neurosteroids between LYR PMS patients, LQS PMS patients and healthy controls (30 subjects in each group). Of the measures, all three groups exhibited no significant differences during the follicular phase. In contrast, during the luteal phase, LYR PMS testosterone levels tended to be higher than controls, while dopamine and 5-HT of the LYR PMS group were significantly higher. Conversely, Î³-aminobutyric acid in the LYR PMS group was significantly lower than controls (p < 0.05). On the other hand, epinephrine and norepinephrine levels in both PMS groups were significantly higher than controls (p < 0.05), while pregnenolone and allopregnanolone of LYR and LQS groups were significantly lower than controls, with dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) being significantly higher than controls (p < 0.05). The ratios of DHEA/allopregnanolone and DHEA/pregnenolone of both PMS groups were significantly higher than the control group, with the LYR PMS group ratios being significantly higher than in the LQS PMS group (p < 0.05). The decrease in pregnenolone and allopregnenolone, increase in DHEA, DHEA/allopregnanolone and DHEA/pregnenolone during the luteal phase may be one of the biological bases for anger in LYR PMS patients and depression in LQS PMS patients.
