## Abstract
This study aimed to investigate the neural substrates of processing depression emotion in premenstrual syndrome (PMS) and healthy subjects of college students using blood oxygenation level-dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging (BOLD-fMRI). During BOLD-fMRI scanning, 13 PMS patients and 15 healthy controls (HC) performed a picture visual stimulation task during luteal and follicular phases, in which participants and HC were asked to see pictures containing depression and non-depression emotions. Simultaneously, self-rating depression scales (SDS) were employed to evaluate the emotional status of participants. Compared to HC, right inferior occipital gyrus, right middle occipital gyrus, right lingual gyrus, right fusiform gyrus, right inferior temporal gyrus, cerebelum_crus1_R, cerebelum_6_R, culmen, the cerebellum anterior lobe, tuber, and cerebellar tonsil of PMS patients showed enhanced activation. In contrast, sub-lobar, sub-gyral, extra-nuclear, right orbit part of superior frontal gyrus, right middle temporal gyrus, right orbit part of inferior frontal gyrus, limbic lobe, right insula, bilateral anterior and adjacent cingulate gyrus, bilateral caudate, caudate head, bilateral putamen, and left globus pallidus exhibited decreased activation. The findings indicate that abnormal functional regulation of brain regions such as occipital lobe and cerebellum leads to abnormal changes in emotional regulation, cognitive ability, and attention distribution in PMS patients, implying significant central pathogenesis.
