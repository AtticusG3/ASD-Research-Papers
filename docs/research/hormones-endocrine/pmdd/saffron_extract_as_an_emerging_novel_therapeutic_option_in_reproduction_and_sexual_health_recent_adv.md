## Abstract
Saffron, derived from Crocus sativus, is gaining research attention for potential therapeutic applications. Its diverse clinical applications extend to cardiovascular health, diabetes management, sleep quality, psychiatric illnesses, and rheumatoid arthritis. Saffron's positive effects on blood pressure, glucose levels, cognitive function, and inflammatory markers contribute to its versatility. Additionally, carotenoids like crocin and crocetin suggest anti-cancer potential. In terms of reproductive health, saffron's impact on male reproductive health shows conflicting findings on semen parameters. However, in female reproductive health, saffron appears promising for managing dysmenorrhoea, reducing menstrual pain, regulating hormonal fluctuations, and improving overall menstrual health. Safety considerations highlight the importance of adhering to specified dosages, as excessive intake may lead to toxicity. Yet, within the therapeutic range, saffron is considered safe, relieving symptoms without serious side effects, according to clinical research. Future trials in 2023 will explore saffron's potential in cancer therapy, diabetes management, mental health, stress response, cardiovascular health, postmenopausal women's well-being, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). This ongoing research underscores saffron's adaptability and promise as a natural treatment across various medical applications, emphasizing its efficacy. The current review, therefore, aims to provide up-to-date insights on saffron's role particularly in the realm of reproductive health, contributing to a growing body of evidence supporting its diverse therapeutic benefits.
