## Abstract
To estimate the prevalence and symptom severity of premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) in Brazilian women according to age groups, and to conduct an association analysis between psychoemotional and somatic symptoms. Cross-sectional study. 303 private clinics across Brazil. 45 160 women aged 20-49 years. Self-report questionnaire regarding the prevalence and intensity of premenstrual symptoms. Statistical analysis performed using Pearson's chi-square test and Poisson regression and multiple logistic regression. Prevalence and intensity of somatic and psychoemotional premenstrual symptoms. Prevalence of PMDD was 3.57% (95% CI: 3.40-3.75). Psychoemotional symptoms were more prevalent than somatic symptoms, with anxiety/tension (99.9%) and irritability/anger (99.8%) being the most frequently reported symptoms. Weight gain (92.5%) and edema (92.1%) were the most prevalent somatic symptoms. Anxiety/tension and headache occurred independently of other symptoms. Binge eating was associated with weight gain (OR = 2.77, 95% CI [2.11, 3.62]), acne (OR = 2.37, 95% CI [1.79, 3.10]), immunoallergic exacerbations (OR = 1.81, 95% CI [1.26, 2;60]) and edema (OR-0.74, 95% CI [0.55, 0.97]). Affective lability was associated with immunoallergic exacerbations (OR = 1.49, 95% CI [1.16, 1.91]) and mastalgia (OR = 1.29, 95% CI [1.02, 1.63]). Depression was associated with acne (OR = 0.72, 95% CI [0.57, 0.89]) and weight gain (OR = 0.77, 95% CI [0.61, 0.96]). The prevalence of PMDD was consistent with other population studies. Psychoemotional symptoms were more prevalent. Association analysis provided new insights into premenstrual symptomatology.
