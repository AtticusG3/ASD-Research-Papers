## Abstract
Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) is a group of psychological, physical, and behavioral symptoms that recur with the menstrual cycle, usually occurring a few days before menstruation and ceasing with the onset of menstruation. Premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) is a severe form of PMS that has been included in a subcategory of depression in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-V) according to the latest diagnostic criteria. Patients usually present with mild to moderate emotional and physical symptoms that affect their routine work, social activities, and family lives. The pathogenesis of PMDD remains unclear, and some researchers believe that it is related to fluctuations in ovarian hormone levels. However, the details of the interrelationships and regulating effects between ovarian hormones, symptoms, and the brain need to be more comprehensively determined. Recent studies have revealed some novel findings on PMS and PMDD based on brain morphology, function, and metabolism. Additionally, multiple studies have suggested that PMS and PMDD are closely related to brain structural and functional variations in certain core temporal lobe regions, such as the amygdala and hippocampus. We summarized neuroimaging studies of PMS and PMDD related to the temporal lobe by retrospectively reviewing relevant literature over the past decade. This review contributes to further clarifying the significant role of the temporal lobe in PMS and PMDD and understanding the neurochemical links between hormones, symptoms, and the brain.
