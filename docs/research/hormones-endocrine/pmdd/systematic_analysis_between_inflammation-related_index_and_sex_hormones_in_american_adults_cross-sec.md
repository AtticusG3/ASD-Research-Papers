## Abstract
A series of novel inflammation-related indexes has been confirmed to be efficient indicators of human immune and inflammatory status, with great potential as predictors for a variety of diseases. However, the association between inflammation-related indexes and sex hormones in the general population remained uncertain. We incorporated data from the NHANES 2013-2016 survey of American adults. On the basis of distribution and comparison analysis, we chose to undertake separate analyses of men and women (including premenopausal and postmenopausal groups). Multivariable weighted linear regression models, eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) models, generalized linear analysis, stratified models, logistic regression models and sensitivity analysis were utilized to assess the relationships between inflammation-related indexes and sex hormones. Total 9372 participants out of 20146 were fitted into our research. We conducted separate gender analysis due to different distribution. Multivariable weighted linear regression indicated every component of the inflammation-related index was negatively correlated with at least one component of the male hormone indexes. However, SII, NLR, PPN, and NC were associated positively with female estradiol. XGBoost identify SII, PLR and NLR were the critical indexes on sex hormones. Inflammation-related indexes was associated with Testosterone deficiency in male and postmenstrual group and associated with Excessive Estradiol in premenstrual group. Finally, the subgroup analysis revealed that the association between sex hormones and inflammatory indicators was prominent in American adults over the age of 60 or those with BMI (>28 kg/m In all, inflammation-related indexes act as independent risks associated with sex hormone alterations and metabolic disorder in both genders. Using multiple models, we revealed the relative importance of inflammation-related indexes. Subgroup analysis also identified the high-risk population. More prospective and experimental research should be conducted to validate the results.
