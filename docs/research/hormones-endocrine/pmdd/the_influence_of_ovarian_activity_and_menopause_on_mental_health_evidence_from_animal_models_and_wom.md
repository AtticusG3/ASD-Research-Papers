## Abstract
Hormonal variations occurring throughout the female reproductive cycle have a significant impact on physical and mental health, particularly due to the influence of estradiol (E2) and progesterone (P4). These changes are directly related to alterations in neurological systems, being associated with conditions such as premenstrual syndrome (PMS), premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD), and mood disorders during hormonal transition phases, such as perimenopause and menopause. Studies conducted in humans and animal models indicate that these fluctuations affect neurotransmitters, neural plasticity, and patterns of brain activity, ultimately influencing quality of life and mental health. Despite extensive research on the topic, the interactions between sex hormones, mental health, and reproductive aging still require further investigation, emphasizing approaches that simultaneously address experimental and behavioral aspects. Thus, this review aims to sumarize findings about the influence of hormonal fluctuations throughout the female reproductive lifespan, including transitions such as perimenopause and menopause, on mental health. A comparative analysis of data from studies in animal models and humans was conducted, highlighting neuroendocrine, behavioral, and emotional mechanisms associated with hormonal changes and their impacts on female mental health.
