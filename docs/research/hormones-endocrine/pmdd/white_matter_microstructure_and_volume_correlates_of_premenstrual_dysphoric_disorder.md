## Abstract
Premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) is a mood disorder characterized by psychological and physical symptoms. Differences in white matter have been associated with affective and anxiety disorders, which share some symptoms with PMDD. However, whether white matter structure differs between the brains of individuals with PMDD and healthy controls is not known, nor is its relation to symptom severity. We performed tract-based spatial statistics and voxel-based morphometry analyses of diffusion tensor imaging metrics and white matter volume, using 2 neuroimaging data sets ( We found greater fractional anisotropy in the left uncinate fasciculus ( It is challenging to interpret group differences in diffusion tensor imaging metrics in terms of their underlying biophysical properties. The small size of the control group in the diffusion tensor imaging study may have prevented effects of interest from being detected. The findings of the present study provide evidence of differential cerebral white matter structure associated with PMDD and its symptoms.
