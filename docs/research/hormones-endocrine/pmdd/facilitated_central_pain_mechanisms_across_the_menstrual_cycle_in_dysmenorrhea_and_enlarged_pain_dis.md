## Abstract
Dysmenorrhea (DYS), or recurrent menstrual pain, is a highly prevalent pain condition among otherwise healthy women. However, the progression of DYS over time and the influence of the menstrual cycle phases need to be better understood. While the location and distribution of pain have been used to assess pain mechanisms in other conditions, they are unexplored in DYS. Thirty otherwise healthy women with severe DYS and 30 healthy control women were recruited into 3 subgroups (n = 10) according to the length of their menstrual history (<5, 5-15, or>15 years since menarche). The intensity and distribution of menstrual pain were recorded. Pressure pain thresholds at abdominal, hip, and arm sites, pressure-induced pain distribution, temporal summation of pain, and pain intensity after pressure cessation over the gluteus medius were assessed at 3 menstrual cycle phases. Compared with the healthy control women, those with DYS showed lower pressure pain thresholds in every site and menstrual cycle phase (P < .05), enlarged pressure-induced pain areas during menstruations (P < .01), and increased temporal summation and pain intensity after pressure cessation in the overall menstrual cycle (P < .05). Additionally, these manifestations were enhanced during the menstrual and premenstrual phases compared to ovulation in women with DYS (P < .01). Women with long-term DYS demonstrated enlarged pressure-induced pain distribution, enlarged menstrual pain areas, and more days with severe menstrual pain compared to the short-term DYS subgroup (P < .01). Pressure-induced and menstrual pain distributions were strongly correlated (P < .001). These findings suggest that severe DYS is a progressive condition underscored by facilitated central pain mechanisms associated with pain recurrence and exacerbation. PERSPECTIVE: Enlarged pressure-induced pain areas occur in DYS, associated with the length of the condition and the distribution of menstrual pain. Generalized hyperalgesia is present throughout the entire menstrual cycle and intensifies during premenstrual and menstrual phases.
