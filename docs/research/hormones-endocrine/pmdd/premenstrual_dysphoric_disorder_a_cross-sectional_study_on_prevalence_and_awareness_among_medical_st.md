## Abstract
Premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD), a severe form of PMS, has been recognized recently as a mental disorder. PMDD can present with disabling physical, mental, and psychological symptoms affecting women's daily functions. Due to its overlapping nature with other disorders, the prevalence of PMDD remains unknown. This study aimed to evaluate the awareness of PMDD among medical students and to assess the prevalence of PMDD among female students. This cross-sectional study included 377 medical students from King Saud bin Abdulaziz University for Health Sciences, Jeddah. PMDD awareness was assessed using a self-developed questionnaire, and prevalence among women was evaluated with the PSST. Data were analyzed using the John's Macintosh Project software, version 10.0 (JMP Statistical Discovery, LLC, Cary, NC), with chi-square, Mann-Whitney, and Kruskal's tests, considering p < 0.05 as statistically significant. Out of 377 students, there was a significant difference in recognizing PMDD as a mental disorder between 106 female students (66%) and 51 male students (27.3%). Significantly higher PMDD awareness was observed among students in the clinical years and those with medical or mental conditions. Around 40% of the students had a positive attitude toward PMDD, believing it may require medical management. Among the 150 female medical students who met the inclusion criteria for PSST assessment to screen for PMDD, 8.7% tested positive, and this was correlated with the severity of dysmenorrhea. Anxiety/tension was the most common symptom in the PMDD group, with significant impairment in social activities and home responsibilities. The study demonstrated a noticeable level of awareness toward PMDD among medical students, especially among women and those in the clinical years. The association between PMDD symptoms and the severity of dysmenorrhea highlights the relationship between hormonal fluctuations and PMDD manifestations. Early detection and intervention are required to improve the quality of life for women with PMDD. Further research is recommended to assess the awareness of practitioners and the general population about the diagnosis of PMDD and to explore PMDD pathophysiology.
