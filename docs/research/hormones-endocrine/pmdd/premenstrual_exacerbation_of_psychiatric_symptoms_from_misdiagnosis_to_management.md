## Abstract
Premenstrual exacerbation of existing mental illnesses (PME) is a condition where symptoms of mental disorders worsen during the luteal phase. Unlike premenstrual syndrome or premenstrual dysphoric disorder, PME is poorly recognised, with misdiagnoses and inadequate treatment. Understanding the brain impact of gonadal hormone fluctuations in PME is crucial.
