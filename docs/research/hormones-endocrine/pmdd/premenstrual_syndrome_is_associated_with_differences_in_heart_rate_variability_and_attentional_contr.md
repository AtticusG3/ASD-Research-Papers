## Abstract
Most persons with an active menstrual cycle suffer from a range of aversive symptoms (e.g. reduced ability to concentrate) in the days before their menstruation - the premenstrual syndrome (PMS). Biological and cognitive mechanisms of PMS are poorly understood. It has been shown that vagally mediated heart rate variability (vmHRV), a physiological marker of self-regulation, decreases during the PMS-affected cycle phase (luteal phase) only in individuals with high PMS symptomology. This study investigates the specific associations between vmHRV, PMS symptomology and cognitive self-regulation (attentional control). In this between-subject study, participants completed an vmHRV baseline measurement through electrocardiography, a reaction time paradigm to measure attentional control (modified attention network test revised, ANT-R) and filled out a questionnaire regarding impact of PMS as well as current menstrual phase. Mixed Model analysis showed interactions effects in the hypothesized direction. VmHRV was decreased during the luteal phase only in individuals with higher PMS. Analogously, performance in the Executive Functioning of the ANT-R task was reduced in the luteal compared to the follicular phase only in individuals with increased PMS symptoms. No effects were found in the Orienting Network Score. The results point in the direction of associations between vmHRV, PMS and self-regulation. This could hint at common underlying mechanisms. Further research, however, must be conducted to examine causal pathways to confirm these associations.
