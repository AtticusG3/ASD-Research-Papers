## Abstract
Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) affects 950 million women worldwide. However, conventional pharmacological treatments offer limited improvements. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of the FemmeBalance supplement in relieving PMS symptoms. We conducted a single-group study of 38 women, aged 18-40, with self-reported PMS symptoms. Participants received the FemmeBalance supplement (two capsules/day) for four menstrual cycles, completing the premenstrual symptoms screening tool (PSST) and study-specific questionnaires at baseline and on day 7 of each cycle. Skin changes were also assessed using dermatologist-graded facial photos. By the first menstrual cycle, all PSST parameters showed significant improvement except insomnia. The greatest improvement was observed in interest in social activities, which improved by 40.13% in the fourth cycle. In addition, period heaviness was significantly decreased by the fourth cycle. Dermatologist skin grading showed improved overall skin health in 91.18% of participants. Moreover, 77.1% of the participants reported reduced PMS symptom severity, and 71.4% reported they would recommend the supplement. FemmeBalance was significantly effective in improving several PMS symptoms, including physical discomfort, mood disturbance, and skin health. The supplement also improved social functioning and overall menstrual health, suggesting that it could be an alternative to conventional PMS treatments.
