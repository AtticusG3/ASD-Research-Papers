## Abstract
An artificial neural network (ANN) based on fundamental principles of physics can simulate the operation of neurobiological reality of membrane potential as well as the properly defined order parameter. This ANN operates in conditions of criticality and simulates the behavior of an excitatory biological neuron, especially the relaxation phase where the critical fluctuations of biological neuron appear. These critical fluctuations can not be explained by the Hodgkin-Huxley (H-H) model. A proposal for the origin of these fluctuations is being discussed.
