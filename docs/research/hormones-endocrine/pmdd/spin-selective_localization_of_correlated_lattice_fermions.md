## Abstract
The interplay between local, repulsive interactions and disorder acting only on one spin orientation of lattice fermions ("spin-dependent disorder") is investigated. The nonmagnetic disorder vs. interaction phase diagram is computed using Dynamical Mean-Field Theory in combination with the geometric average over disorder. The latter determines the typical local density of states and is therefore sensitive to Anderson localization. The effect of spin-dependent disorder is found to be very different from that of conventional disorder. In particular, it destabilizes the metallic solution and leads to a novel spin-selective, localized phase at weak interactions and strong disorder.
