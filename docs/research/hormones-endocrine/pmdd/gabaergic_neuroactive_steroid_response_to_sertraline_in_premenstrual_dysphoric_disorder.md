## Abstract
Premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) affects approximately 5% of menstruating individuals, with significant negative mood symptoms in the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle. PMDD's pathophysiology and treatment mechanisms are poorly characterized, but may involve altered neuroactive steroid function in the brain. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), a first-line PMDD treatment, reportedly alter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic neuroactive steroid levels in PMDD. The aims of this study were to determine whether the SSRI sertraline increased serum levels of neuroactive steroids that modulate the effect of GABA at GABA-A receptors (GABAAR) and if so, whether an increase was associated with improvement in PMDD symptoms. Participants included controls and individuals with PMDD. Serum levels of 9 neuroactive steroids were measured (3α,5α-THP; 3α5β-THP; pregnenolone; 3α,5α-androsterone; 3α,5β-androsterone; 3α,5α-A-diol; 3α5β-A-diol; 3α,5α-THDOC; 3α5β-THDOC) in the follicular and luteal phases. In the subsequent luteal phase, neuroactive steroids were measured during sertraline treatment (50 mg sertraline from approximate ovulation to menses onset) in the PMDD group. Mixed models assessed associations among diagnostic group, menstrual cycle phase, and sertraline treatment. Participants included 38 controls and 32 women with PMDD. There were no significant differences in neuroactive steroid levels between controls and participants with PMDD in the luteal phase (p > 0.05). Within the PMDD group, sertraline treatment significantly increased serum pregnanolone levels and the pregnanolone:progesterone ratio, and decreased 3α,5α-androsterone. This was the first study to assess the impact of SSRI treatment on peripheral levels of GABAergic neuroactive steroids in PMDD. Within the PMDD group, sertraline treatment was associated with a significant increase in luteal phase serum pregnanolone levels and a significantly increased pregnanolone:progesterone ratio, a novel finding. Future research should examine alterations in the metabolic pathways among GABAergic neuroactive steroids in individuals with PMDD, in a placebo-controlled design.
