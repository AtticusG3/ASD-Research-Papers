## Abstract
Sensitivity to ovarian hormone fluctuations can lead to mental distress during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle, such as in premenstrual syndrome (PMS) and premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD), and also during pregnancy and postpartum, as in perinatal depression (PND). In two cohorts, we investigated the relationship between history of PMS/PMDD and PND symptoms. We also examined how premenstrual symptoms are associated with perinatal symptom trajectories and dimensional phenotypes of PND symptoms, which remains unidentified. From early pregnancy until 6 months postpartum, participants of two large longitudinal cohorts were followed using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS). Premenstrual symptoms were self-reported retrospectively. Both pre-pregnancy PMS and PMDD were associated with higher EPDS scores across pregnancy and postpartum, even after adjustment for confounders. The odds of developing PND were higher among those reporting PMS and PMDD, ranging up to 1.68 (95% CI 1.25-2.29) (6-13 weeks postpartum) and 3.05 (95% CI 2.26-4.10) (late pregnancy) respectively for PMS and PMDD, throughout the perinatal period. Premenstrual symptomatology was associated more with certain PND trajectories based on the time of occurrence and persistence of symptoms. However, PND symptom severity did not differ depending on premenstrual symptomatology in any trajectory. Prior PMS/PMDD was associated with underlying dimensions of symptom constructs of PND, including severe and moderate symptoms of depressed mood, anxiety and anhedonia. Women with a history of PMS/PMDD require coordinated care by psychiatrists, other mental health clinicians, midwives and gynaecologists during pregnancy as well as postpartum.
