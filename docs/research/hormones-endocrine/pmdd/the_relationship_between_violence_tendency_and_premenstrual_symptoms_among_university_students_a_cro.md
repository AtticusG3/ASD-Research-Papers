## Abstract
Literature discusses the relationship between young women's violent tendencies and biological, psychological, and social factors. Notably, hormonal fluctuations during the menstrual cycle are reflected in mood swings and aggression levels, which may increase the tendency of young women to resort to violence. This study aimed to evaluate the relationship between violent tendencies and premenstrual symptoms in university students. Data for this cross-sectional analytical study were collected from 1301 students via a Google survey between January and May 2020 using the Personal Information Form, Premenstrual Syndrome Scale (PMSS), and Violence Tendency Scale (VTS). It was determined that 65.3% of students had PMS, and the students' VTS scores was high in 25.8% of them and low in 73.2 of them. There was significant correlation between the students' VTS scores in both subscales and total scores of PMSS (P < 0.05), PMSS' anxiety (β = 0.171), irritability (β = 0.348), and sleep changes (β = 0.182) subscale scores positively affected VTS scores (P < 0.05). Most of the students in the study were found to suffer from PMS, and PMS symptoms, particularly anxiety, irritability, and sleep disturbances, were associated with higher VTS scores. These results suggest that specific symptoms of PMS may play an important role in determining students' VTS scores, and this may have implications for understanding PMS broader effects on student wellbeing and performance. Health professionals can provide education and health services aimed at reducing premenstrual symptoms, preventing violent tendencies, and providing resources and foundations for future studies by conducting more studies.
