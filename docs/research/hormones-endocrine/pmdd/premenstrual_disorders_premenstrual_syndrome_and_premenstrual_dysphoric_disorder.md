## Abstract
Recently, the term premenstrual disorders (PMDs), which includes premenstrual syndrome and premenstrual dysphoric disorder as a continuum, has been proposed. Although the precise etiology of PMDs remains unknown, the involvement of hormonal fluctuations is clear. The brain transmitters, serotonin and Î³-amino butyric acid, also seem to be involved. Serotonin reuptake inhibitors and oral contraceptives are the current mainstay of treatment, but these are insufficient. Even the currently used prospective two-period symptom diary is not widely used in actual clinical practice, creating a major problem of discrepancy between research and clinical practice. In this review, I would like to outline the latest information and problems in the etiology, diagnosis, and treatment of PMDs, with an emphasis on promising new therapies.
