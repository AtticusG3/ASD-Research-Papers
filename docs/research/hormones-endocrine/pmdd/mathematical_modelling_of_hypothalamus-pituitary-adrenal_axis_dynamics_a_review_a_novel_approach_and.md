## Abstract
A novel mathematical model for the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis is proposed to comprehend the oscillations observed in hormone concentration and potential dysfunction within the HPA axis in stressful situation. This model integrates impact of hippocampal receptors on the secretion of corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), an additional signaling pathway involving Arginine Vasopressin (AVP) for the production and secretion of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), the inclusion of a daylight-related function for modeling circadian rhythms, and a short negative feedback loop from the pituitary to the hypothalamus in a minimal mechanistic model of the HPA axis. This expansion allows us to estimate model parameters that led to a significant reduction in the mean absolute percent error, thereby enhancing the model's predictive accuracy with a demonstration of a strong fit to the validation dataset. Through sensitivity and correlation analyses, our study shows the parameters that exert the most significant influence on the dynamics of cortisol within the system. This study reveals intricate interdependencies within the model and among the various components of the HPA axis. Despite current advancements in the model to comprehend the dynamics of the HPA Axis, these models are still lacking in addressing major factors such as the impact of genetic and epigenetics, the role of the amygdala in processing and transmitting stress signals, and other minor impacting factors.
