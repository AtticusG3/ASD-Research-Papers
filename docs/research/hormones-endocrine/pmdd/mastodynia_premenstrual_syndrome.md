## Abstract
Mastodynia is defined as breast tenderness and pain, also called mastalgia. There are several types of cyclic, noncyclic and extramammary. The cyclic mastodynia is the most common one, and represents a clinical symptom of the premenstrual syndrome and of the more severe premenstrual dysphoric disorder. The article outlines different types of mastalgia with their typical clinical features, including the relatively rear Tietze's syndrome and MONDOR'S disease, as well as the PMS and the PMDD. The authors also offer a diagnostic algorithm and specific diagnostic criteria. There is also a discussion on the main treatment alternatives being symptomatic treatment of the most troublesome symptoms or alteration of the menstrual cycle and a brief discussion on the pharmaceutical preparations used for treatment including the administration of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI).
