## Abstract
γ-Aminobutyric acid type A receptors (GABAARs) play an important role in cognitive and emotional regulation and are related to the hippocampus. However, little is known regarding patterns of hippocampal GABAAR subunit expression in rat models of premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD). This study investigated the above changes by establishing two PMDD rat models based on Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) theories, namely, PMDD liver-qi invasion syndrome (PMDD-LIS) and PMDD liver-qi depression syndrome (PMDD-LDS). Behavioral tests were used to detect depression and irritability emotion. Western blot analysis was used to investigate protein levels of GABAAR α1, α2, α4, α5, β2, β3, and δ subunits, whereas ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS) analysis was performed to determine gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and glutamate (Glu) levels in the hippocampus across each group. Concurrently, behavioral data indicated that the PMDD-LDS and PMDD-LIS rat models had been successfully established. GABAAR α2, α5, β2, and δ subunit was significantly upregulated, whereas α4 was significantly downregulated (P < 0.05) in PMDD-LDS rat models relative to controls. On the other hand, GABAAR α1, α2, and β3 were significantly downregulated while α4 and β2 were significantly upregulated in PMDD-LIS rat models relative to the control group (P < 0.05). Moreover, GABA levels significantly decreased, while Glu and the ratio of glutamate to GABA increased in PMDD-LIS rat models (P < 0.05). Conversely, GABA and Glu levels significantly decreased, whereas the ratio of glutamate to GABA increased in PMDD-LIS rat models (P < 0.05). Conclusively, our results revealed differential expression of GABAAR α1, α2, α4, α5, β2, β3, and δ subunits between PMDD-LIS and PMDD-LDS rat models, suggesting that they may be biomarkers in the pathogenesis of PMDD.
