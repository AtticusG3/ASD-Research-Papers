## Abstract
This research project aims to tackle the growing mental health challenges in today's digital age. It employs a modified pre-trained BERT model to detect depressive text within social media and users' web browsing data, achieving an impressive 93% test accuracy. Simultaneously, the project aims to incorporate physiological signals from wearable devices, such as smartwatches and EEG sensors, to provide long-term tracking and prognosis of mood disorders and emotional states. This comprehensive approach holds promise for enhancing early detection of depression and advancing overall mental health outcomes.
