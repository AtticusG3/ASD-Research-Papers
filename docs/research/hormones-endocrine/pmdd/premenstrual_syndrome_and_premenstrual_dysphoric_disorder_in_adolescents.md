## Abstract
Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) and premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) represent two premenstrual disorders characterized by physical and psychological symptoms that occur in the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle, prior to the onset of menses, and have a negative impact on the psychosocial functioning of affected individuals. PMS, more common than PMDD, affects 20-40% of menstruating women, with common symptoms including fatigue, irritability, mood swings, depression, abdominal bloating, breast tenderness, acne, changes in appetite and food cravings. PMDD, affecting a smaller percentage of women, is characterized by more severe symptoms and is listed as a depressive disorder in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5). While the pathophysiology of these premenstrual disorders remains unclear, it has been hypothesized that sensitivity to hormonal fluctuations during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle, abnormal serotonergic activity, and aberrations in progesterone and the neurotransmitter gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA) may all play a role in these disorders. Treatment of PMS and PMDD is focused on alleviation of symptoms and improvement of functioning and quality of life for affected individuals. The treatment of severe PMS and PMDD typically requires pharmacologic therapy with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), oral contraceptive pills (OCPs), gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists, and non-contraceptive estrogen formulations. Non-pharmacologic treatment with diet, exercise, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), certain vitamin and herbal supplements, and acupuncture may additionally be effective for some individuals.
