## Abstract
To provide recommendations for the management of premenstrual syndrome and premenstrual dysphoric disorder, collectively referred to as premenstrual disorders, based on assessment of the evidence regarding the safety and efficacy of available treatment options. An overview of the epidemiology, pathophysiology, and diagnosis of premenstrual disorders also is included to provide readers with relevant background information and context for the clinical recommendations. Reproductive-aged adults and adolescents with premenstrual symptoms. This guideline was developed using an a priori protocol in conjunction with a writing team consisting of two specialists in obstetrics and gynecology appointed by the ACOG Committee on Clinical Practice Guidelines-Gynecology and one external subject matter expert. ACOG medical librarians completed a comprehensive literature search for primary literature within Cochrane Library, Cochrane Collaboration Registry of Controlled Trials, EMBASE, PubMed, and MEDLINE. Studies that moved forward to the full-text screening stage were assessed by two authors from the writing team based on standardized inclusion and exclusion criteria. Included studies underwent quality assessment, and a modified GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluations) evidence-to-decision framework was applied to interpret and translate the evidence into recommendation statements. This Clinical Practice Guideline includes recommendations on the following evidence-based treatment options for premenstrual disorders, with an acknowledgement that many patients may benefit from a multimodal approach that combines several interventions: pharmacologic agents (hormonal and nonhormonal), psychological counseling, complementary and alternative treatments, exercise and nutritional therapies, patient education and self-help strategies, and surgical management. Recommendations are classified by strength and evidence quality. Ungraded Good Practice Points are included to provide guidance when a formal recommendation could not be made because of inadequate or nonexistent evidence. Based on review of extrapolated data from adult populations and expert consensus, it was determined that the recommendations also apply to adolescents, with a few exceptions that are noted in the Clinical Practice Guideline.
