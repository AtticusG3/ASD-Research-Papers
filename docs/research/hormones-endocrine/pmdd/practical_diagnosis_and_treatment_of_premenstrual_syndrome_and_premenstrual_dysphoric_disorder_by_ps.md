## Abstract
To investigate and compare the diagnoses and treatment of premenstrual syndrome (PMS) and premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) from the perspectives of psychiatrists and obstetricians/gynecologists (OB/GYNs) in Japan. Between December 2021 and February 2022, a web-based survey was conducted among the members of the Japanese Association of Neuro-Psychiatric Clinics. Data from 262 psychiatrists who responded to the aforementioned survey were compared with data from 409 OB/GYNs from a survey conducted in 2021 among members of the Japanese Society of Obstetrics and Gynecology. Overall, 79.8% of psychiatrists and 97.3% of OB/GYNs were involved in practicing PMS/PMDD diagnosis and treatment. Most psychiatrists believed that PMS should be treated by OB/GYNs (74.4%) and PMDD by psychiatrists (75.6%). Only vague medical interviews were conducted by 86.6% of psychiatrists, and only 9.7% maintained a two-cycle symptom diary. Psychiatrists mostly prescribed selective serotonin/serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor (SSRI/SNRI) continuous dosing (91.1%), followed by Kampo medicines, especially Many Japanese psychiatrists and OB/GYNs do not base PMS/PMDD diagnoses on prospective monitoring methods using specific diagnostic criteria and therefore do not provide evidence-based treatment. Moreover, a tendency of being biased toward treatments in which the department specialized was observed.
