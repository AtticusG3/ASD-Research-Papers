## Abstract
This triple-blinded, randomized, controlled trial was conducted on 80 women. The subjects were assigned to two groups of intervention (receiving EA 2 g/day and FV 1 g/day, in the second two weeks of the cycle, in two consecutive cycles) and placebo control. The data collection tools included the PSST, DRSP, and SF36 questionnaires. Between-group differences in all subscales of DRSP were significant at one- and two-month time points (p<0.05). Bleeding volume was significantly increased in the intervention group, compared to the placebo group, two months after the intervention (p<0.05). Between-group comparison of the changes demonstrated significant differences in all subscales of SF36, except for limitations in usual role activities due to emotional problems (p=0.07). Consumption of EA and FV combination improved the quality of life in women with PMS and exerted favorable changes in PMS symptoms.
