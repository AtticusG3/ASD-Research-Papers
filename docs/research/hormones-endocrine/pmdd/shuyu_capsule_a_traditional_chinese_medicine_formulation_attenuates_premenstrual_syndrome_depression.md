## Abstract
The present study aimed to investigate the therapeutic effect of the Shu-Yu capsule (SYC), a Traditional Chinese Medicine formulation, on premenstrual syndrome (PMS) depression and the ratio of glutamate (Glu) to γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in a rat model of PMS depression. Rats were randomly divided into a control group, model group, fluoxetine group, SYC group and saikosaponins (SS) group. The therapeutic effect of SYC was evaluated using a sucrose preference test (SPT), open field test (OFT) and body mass following four days of treatment. Hippocampal extracellular fluid was collected by microdialysis and the levels of Glu and GABA in the microdialysate were measured by high performance liquid chromatography. The results revealed that, compared with the control group, the sucrose preference coefficient (SC%), total score of OFT and body mass of the model group were significantly lower (P<0.01, P<0.05 and P<0.01, respectively). However, the sucrose preference coefficient, total score of OFT and body mass of the SYC group were all significantly increased compared with the model group (P<0.05). Furthermore, SYC inhibited the decrease of the Glu/GABA ratio in the hippocampus of rats with PMS depression. It was concluded that SYC effectively improved the symptoms of PMS depression, possibly by inhibiting the dysregulation of the Glu/GABA balance in the central nervous system.
