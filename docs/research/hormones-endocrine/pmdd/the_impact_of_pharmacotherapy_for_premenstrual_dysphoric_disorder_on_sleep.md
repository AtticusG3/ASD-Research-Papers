## Abstract
Premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) affects a subset of women of reproductive age, characterized by severe mood disturbances and physical symptoms during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle. Symptoms include mood swings, irritability, anxiety, fatigue, physical discomfort, and disruptions to sleep and circadian rhythms, such as altered melatonin secretion. Despite the prevalence of these symptoms, the impact of PMDD treatments on sleep and circadian markers, like melatonin, remains insufficiently understood. This review examines how dysregulated serotonin signaling, disrupted allopregnanolone activity (a neurosteroid derived from progesterone), and aberrant circadian rhythms contribute to PMDD. It also explores the effects of pharmacological treatments, including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, on sleep and melatonin regulation, and how these factors influence treatment outcomes. Additionally, the use of hypnotics and sedatives to manage sleep disturbances in PMDD is considered, weighing their potential benefits and risks. A deeper understanding of the interaction between PMDD symptoms, sleep, and circadian rhythms is crucial for developing more effective treatments. Further research is needed to explore the relationship between symptom management, sleep patterns, and circadian function in PMDD, and to determine how these factors can be optimized to improve clinical outcomes and quality of life for women affected by the disorder.
