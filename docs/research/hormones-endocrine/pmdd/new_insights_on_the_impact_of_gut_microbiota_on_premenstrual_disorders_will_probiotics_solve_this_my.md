## Abstract
Premenstrual disorders (PMDs) refer to premenstrual syndrome (PMS) and premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD), where both are characterized by physical and psychological changes occurring in the luteal phase of menstrual cycle. According to the available theories, there is no single accusation succeeded to explain the pathophysiology of PMDs. However, there is emerging evidence for the role of gut microbiota (GM) in PMDs, supported by the diverging impact of GM on our body systems. The direct secretory function of GM and their integration in hormonal, neurotransmitters and bioactive compounds secretion and activity reinforce this speculation. Moreover, the bidirectional relation between GM and steroid hormones and the impact of diet, drugs, and inflammation on both, GM and PMDs incidence and severity justify the need for more studies to determine the actual role of GM in PMDs and the possible potential of probiotics and prebiotics as therapeutic options.
