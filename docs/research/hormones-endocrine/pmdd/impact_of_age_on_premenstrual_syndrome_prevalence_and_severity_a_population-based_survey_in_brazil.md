## Abstract
To evaluate the relationship between premenstrual disorders (PMD) and age, we analyzed the prevalence and severity of psycho-emotional and physical symptoms in a representative sample of Brazilian women. This observational and retrospective study analyzed data from Brazilian women aged 20-49 years from five regions of the country who reported premenstrual symptoms. Participants completed a premenstrual symptom screening questionnaire and self-reported the presence and severity of their symptoms. Among 23 104 women reporting does premenstrual symptoms, 38.91% (n = 8990) experienced PMD caused functional impairment. Finally, 5121 participants agreed to complete the adapted version of the screening questionnaire. The age group distribution was 20-29 (46.7%), 30-39 (38.3%), and 40-49 years (15%). The most prevalent and severe physical symptom was acne/oily skin in participants aged 20-29 years and headache in women aged 30-49 years. Regarding psycho-emotional symptoms, the most prevalent was anxiety/tension in women aged 20-29 years and 40-49 years and irritability/anger in those aged 30-39 years. Irritability/anger was the most severe symptom in all groups. PMD significantly impacts the quality of life of Brazilian women with varying intensity. Physical symptoms associated with PMD vary with age, while psycho-emotional symptoms, particularly irritability/anger and anxiety, were intense in Brazilian women of reproductive age. These findings inform early diagnosis and individualized treatment approaches for PMD, addressing the needs of women.
