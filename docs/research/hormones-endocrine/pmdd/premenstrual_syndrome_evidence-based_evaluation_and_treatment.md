## Abstract
Premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) is defined by both physical and psychiatric symptoms that impact a woman significantly during the luteal phase of her menstrual cycle. Diagnostic criteria for PMDD were firmly established in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders V in 2013, but many patients fall short of the diagnosis while still appreciably affected by severe premenstrual symptoms. More recent and robust investigations have evaluated the efficacy of treatment ranging from serotonergic therapy to hormonal treatment as well as lifestyle and herbal remedies. This article reviews the evidence for diagnosis and treatment of PMDD.
