## Abstract
Many women may change their eating behaviors and exhibit different behaviors during their premenstrual period. Although there are studies evaluating the nutritional status of women with premenstrual syndrome in the literature, a limited number of studies evaluate the eating behaviors of these women. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the relationship between premenstrual syndrome (PMS) symptoms, anthropometric measurements, and eating behaviors in women of childbearing age. The study was conducted with 351 adult women aged 18-49 years. Data were collected through a face-to-face questionnaire form. Participants' sociodemographic characteristics, eating behaviors, and PMS symptoms were determined using a questionnaire. In addition, the participants' anthropometric measurements (body weight, height, and waist circumference) were taken. The Three Factor Eating Questionnaire (TFEQ) was used to evaluate eating behaviors. The premenstrual Syndrome Scale (PMSS) was used to determine the severity of PMS. Individuals with PMS-positive had higher scores for uncontrolled eating, emotional eating, and cognitive restriction than PMS-negative (p < 0.05). It was determined that age, body mass index (BMI), and Premenstrual Syndrome Scale (PMSS) total score affected uncontrolled eating and emotional eating (p < 0.05). BMI and PMSS total score were determined to affect cognitive restriction (p < 0.05). In conclusion, the present study showed that PMS affects eating behaviors in adult women. Both PMS and eating disorders are factors that can negatively affect daily life. Therefore, it is important to investigate and correctly define the relationship between them in terms of increasing women's quality of life. Comprehensive intervention studies are also needed in this regard. We think that our study can shed light on these further studies.
