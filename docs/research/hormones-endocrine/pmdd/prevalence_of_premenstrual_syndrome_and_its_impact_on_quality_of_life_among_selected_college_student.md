## Abstract
Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) refers to a set of distressing symptoms experienced around the time of menstrual flow. Hormonal changes may underlie these symptoms which can lead to difficulties in day-to-day functioning and poor quality of life. In this cross-sectional study, 300 students attending the science stream at a women's college of Puducherry were administered self-reported questionnaires to obtain socio- demographic, dietary, lifestyle and family details. The Shortened Premenstrual Assessment Form was used to assess PMS, a symptom checklist was used to assess premenstrual dysphoric disorder and Short From 36 was used to assess quality of life. The prevalence of PMS was 62.7%. Back, joint and muscle aches were the most common symptoms followed by abdominal heaviness and discomfort. PMS was associated with a poorer quality of life across all domains. About half the students had affective symptoms in the premenstrual phase. Dietary and lifestyle factors such as consumption of sweets and lack of physical activity were associated with the presence of PMS.
