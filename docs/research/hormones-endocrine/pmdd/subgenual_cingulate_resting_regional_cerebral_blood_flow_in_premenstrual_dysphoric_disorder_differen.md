## Abstract
Substantial evidence suggests that circulating ovarian steroids modulate behavior differently in women with PMDD than in those without this condition. However, hormonal state-related abnormalities of neural functioning in PMDD remain to be better characterized. In addition, while altered neural function in PMDD likely co-exists with alterations in intrinsic cellular function, such a relationship has not been explored. Here, we investigated the effects of ovarian steroids on basal, resting regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in PMDD, and, in an exploratory analysis, we tested whether the rCBF findings were linked to the expression of ESC/E(Z) genes, which form an essential ovarian steroid-regulated gene-silencing complex. Resting rCBF was measured with oxygen-15 water PET (189 PET sessions in 43 healthy women and 20 women with PMDD) during three self-as-own-control conditions: GnRH agonist (Lupron)-induced ovarian suppression, estradiol add-back, and progesterone add-back. ESC/E(Z) gene expression data were obtained from RNA-sequencing of lymphoblastoid cell lines performed in a previous study and were examined in relation to hormone-induced changes in rCBF. In the rCBF PET data, there was a significant diagnosis-by-hormone interaction in the subgenual cingulate (P
