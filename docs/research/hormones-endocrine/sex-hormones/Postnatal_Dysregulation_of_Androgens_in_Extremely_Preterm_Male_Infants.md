## Abstract

Neurodevelopmental impairments are common among survivors of extremely preterm birth, particularly in males. Hyperactivation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis has been suggested as an underlying cause, but this has been poorly investigated. Establish levels and temporal changes in circulating androgens in extremely preterm infant males. Observational cohort study analyzing cord blood serum (n = 25) and postnatal plasma (n = 13) collected from day 0 until week 11 from infant males born at 22.8-27.9 weeks gestational age. Testosterone and dihydrotestosterone (DHT) were determined using gas chromatography mass spectrometry, sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) with the Luminex xMAP multiplex assay. Testosterone and DHT levels were higher on day 0 (median 4.27 and 0.30 ng/mL) than in cord blood (0.15 and 0.01 ng/mL) ( The HPG axis is activated immediately after birth in extremely preterm infant males, resulting in an androgen pulse occurring several months earlier than during a normal pregnancy. The long-term implications of high androgen exposure during a sensitive neurodevelopmental period warrant further studies.
