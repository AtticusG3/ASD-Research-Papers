## Abstract
Progesterone is a natural steroid hormone, while progestins are synthetic molecules. In the female reproductive system, progesterone contributes to the control of luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone secretion and their pulsatility, via its receptors on the kisspeptin, neurokinin B, and dynorphin neurons in the hypothalamus. Progesterone together with estradiol controls the cyclic changes of proliferation and decidualization of the endometrium; exerts anti-mitogenic actions on endometrial epithelial cells; regulates normal menstrual bleeding; contributes to fertilization and pregnancy maintenance; participates in the onset of labor. In addition, it exerts numerous effects on other endocrine systems. Micronized progesterone (MP) is natural progesterone with increased bioavailability, due to its pharmacotechnical micronized structure, which makes it an attractive diagnostic and therapeutic tool. This critical literature review aims to summarize and put forward the potential diagnostic and therapeutic uses of MP in the field of endocrinology. During reproductive life, MP is used for diagnostic purposes in the evaluation of primary or secondary amenorrhea as a challenge test. Moreover, it can be prescribed to women presenting with amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea for induction of withdrawal bleeding, in order to time blood-sampling for diagnostic purposes in early follicular phase. Therapeutically, MP, alone or combined with estrogens, is a useful tool in various endocrine disorders including primary amenorrhea, abnormal uterine bleeding due to disordered ovulation, luteal phase deficiency, premenstrual syndrome, polycystic ovary syndrome, secondary amenorrhea [functional hypothalamic amenorrhea, premature ovarian insufficiency], perimenopause and menopause. When administrated per os, acting as a neurosteroid directly or through its metabolites, it exerts beneficial effects on brain function such as alleviation of symptoms of anxiety and depression, asw well as of sleep problems, while it improves working memory in peri- and menopausal women. Micronized progesterone preserves full potential of progesterone activity, without presenting many of the side-effects of progestins. Although it has been associated with more frequent drowsiness and dizziness, it can be well tolerated with nocturnal administration. Because of its better safety profile, especially with regard to metabolic ailments, breast cancer risk and veno-thromboembolism risk, MP is the preferred option for individuals with an increased risk of cardiovascular and metabolic diseases and of all-cause mortality.
