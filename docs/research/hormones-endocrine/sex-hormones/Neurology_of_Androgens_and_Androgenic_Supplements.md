## Abstract

This article explores the intricate relationship between androgens, androgen receptors, and the central nervous system. We examine the role of physiologically derived androgens and androgenic supplements in neurodevelopment and neuroplasticity and delve into the involvement of androgen pathways in the pathogenesis of various neurological disorders. This review highlights the increasing recognition of testosterone and androgen signaling in various neurological conditions, with evidence of both protective and harmful effects depending on dosage and context. Although limited to experimental use, testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) may serve potential benefits in the management of multiple sclerosis, epilepsy, headache, Duchenne muscular dystrophy, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and Parkinson disease. On the other hand, androgen-blocking treatments may help alter disease progression in spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy. Testosterone supplementation can have potential adverse events when used at a supratherapeutic level, and prenatal testosterone exposure is believed to contribute to the pathogenesis of neurodevelopmental disease. Additionally, androgen-blocking agents could increase the risk of neurodegenerative conditions, such as Parkinson disease and Alzheimer disease. Despite the above findings, there is no established indication of TRT or androgen-blocking medication in neurological disorders. The body of evidence highlighting the involvement of androgens and androgen receptors (ARs) in pathogenesis of neurological diseases is growing. This includes ongoing research exploring the potential therapeutic targets involving the androgen signaling pathway for management of neurological disorders. Future placebo-controlled clinical trials are essential to determine the efficacy and safety of TRT or androgen-blocking therapies in managing neurological disease.
