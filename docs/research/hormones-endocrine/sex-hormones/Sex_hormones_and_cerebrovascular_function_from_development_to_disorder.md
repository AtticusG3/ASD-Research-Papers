## Abstract

Proper cerebrovascular development and neurogliovascular unit assembly are essential for brain growth and function throughout life, ensuring the continuous supply of nutrients and oxygen. This involves crucial events during pre- and postnatal stages through key pathways, including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and Wnt signaling. These pathways are pivotal for brain vascular growth, expansion, and blood-brain barrier (BBB) maturation. Interestingly, during fetal and neonatal life, cerebrovascular formation coincides with the early peak activity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, supporting the idea of sex hormonal influence on cerebrovascular development and barriergenesis.Sex hormonal dysregulation in early development has been implicated in neurodevelopmental disorders with highly sexually dimorphic features, such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Both disorders show higher prevalence in men, with varying symptoms between sexes, with boys exhibiting more externalizing behaviors, such as aggressivity or hyperactivity, and girls displaying higher internalizing behaviors, including anxiety, depression, or attention disorders. Indeed, ASD and ADHD are linked to high prenatal testosterone exposure and reduced aromatase expression, potentially explaining sex differences in prevalence and symptomatology. In line with this, high estrogen levels seem to attenuate ADHD symptoms. At the cerebrovascular level, sex- and region-specific variations of cerebral blood flow perfusion have been reported in both conditions, indicating an impact of gonadal hormones on the brain vascular system, disrupting its ability to respond to neuronal demands.This review aims to provide an overview of the existing knowledge concerning the impact of sex hormones on cerebrovascular formation and maturation, as well as the onset of neurodevelopmental disorders. Here, we explore the concept of gonadal hormone interactions with brain vascular and BBB development to function, with a particular focus on the modulation of VEGF and Wnt signaling. We outline how these pathways may be involved in the underpinnings of ASD and ADHD. Outstanding questions and potential avenues for future research are highlighted, as uncovering sex-specific physiological and pathological aspects of brain vascular development might lead to innovative therapeutic approaches in the context of ASD, ADHD and beyond.
