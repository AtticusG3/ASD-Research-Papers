## Abstract

Higher prenatal testosterone exposure regulates brain development and affects learning and intelligence directly. The digit ratio (2D:4D) is regarded as an indicator of prenatal testosterone exposure. This study aims to investigate the 2D:4D ratios and intelligence levels in individuals with specific learning disorders (SLD) and compare the ratios with healthy subjects. The study included a total of 117 patients diagnosed with SLD and 67 healthy controls. We measured the 2D:4D ratios and administered the Wechsler-Intelligence Scale for Children-Revised to assess intelligence quotient (IQ) scores in the SLD group. Sociodemographic data was obtained for both patients and healthy subjects and compared in both groups, as well as 2D:4D ratios. Compared to healthy controls, both-hand 2D:4D ratios were found to be lower in the SLD group. In addition, male and female participants with SLD showed lower 2D:4D ratios in both hands than controls. The total scores on the WISC-R were found to decrease as the right-hand 2D:4D ratios and the age increased in the SLD group. Our findings add to the literature examining the influence of prenatal testosterone exposure on learning and intelligence in the SLD sample. Further research in this domain may yield valuable insights into the underlying mechanisms and potential clinical implications for the management of SLDs examining additional variables that could potentially impact alongside the impact of sex hormones on brain development.
