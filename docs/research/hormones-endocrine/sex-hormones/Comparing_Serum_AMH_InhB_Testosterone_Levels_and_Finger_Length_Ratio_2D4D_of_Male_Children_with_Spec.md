## Abstract

It has been suggested that inhibin B (InhB), Anti-Müllerian hormone (Müllerian-inhibiting substance, AMH) levels, and 2D/4D finger length ratios are related to sex differences in neurodevelopmental disorders. The aim of this study is to investigate the role of InhB, AMH levels, and 2D/4D finger length ratios in male children with specific learning disorder (SLD). The study included 38 male children diagnosed with SLD and 38 males of similar ages without SLD as the control group. Tests used in the evaluation were the Kiddie Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School-Age Children-Present and Lifetime version, Specific learning disorder clinical observation battery, Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Revised (WISC-R), and Conners' Parent Rating Scale. Short Form. Serum AMH, InhB, and Testosterone levels were measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Male children diagnosed with SLD demonstrated significantly higher levels of serum InhB compared to controls (t= 2.59 p=0.009); both groups had similar levels of serum testosterone and AMH. The 2D/4D finger ratios in the SLD group were found to be lower than those in the control group (t= 2.92 p= 0.005). Serum InhB levels were positively correlated with WISC-R verbal scores (p= 0.003). Our findings suggest that serum InhB levels and the 2D/4D ratio, which is an indicator of prenatal testosterone exposure, may play a role in the male predominance of SLD.
