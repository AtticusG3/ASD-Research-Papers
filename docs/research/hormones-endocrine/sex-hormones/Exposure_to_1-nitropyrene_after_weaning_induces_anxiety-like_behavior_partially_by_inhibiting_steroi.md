## Abstract

1-Nitropyrene (1-NP) is a neurodevelopmental toxicant. This study was to evaluate the impact of exposure to 1-NP after weaning on anxiety-like behavior. Five-week-old mice were administered with 1-NP (0.1 or 1Â mg/kg) daily for 4 weeks. Anxiety-like behaviour was measured using elevated-plus maze (EPM) and open field test (OFT). In EPM test, time spending in open arm and times entering open arm were reduced in 1-NP-treated mice. In OFT test, time spent in the center region and times entering the center region were diminished in 1-NP-treated mice. Prefrontal dendritic length and number of dendrite branches were decreased in 1-NP-treated mice. Prefrontal PSD95, an excitatory postsynaptic membrane protein, and gephyrin, an inhibitory postsynaptic membrane protein, were downregulated in 1-NP-treated mice. Further analysis showed that peripheral steroid hormones, including serum testosterone (T) and estradiol (E
