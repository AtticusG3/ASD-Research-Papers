## Abstract

An early prediction of outcomes of neonatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (NE) is of key importance in reducing neonatal mortality and morbidity. The objectives were (i) to analyze the characteristics of miRNA expression and metabolic patterns of neonates with NE and (ii) to assess their predictive performance for neurodevelopmental outcomes. Plasma samples from moderate/severe NE patients (N = 92) of the HYPOTOP study were collected before, during, and after therapeutic hypothermia (TH) and compared to a control group (healthy term infants). The expression of miRNAs and concentrations of metabolites (hypoxia-related and energy, steroid, and tryptophan metabolisms) were analyzed. Neurodevelopmental outcomes were evaluated at 24 months postnatal age using Bayley Scales of Infant Development, ed. III, BSID-III. Differences in miRNA and metabolic profiles were found between NE vs. control infants, abnormal (i.e., mildly and moderately abnormal and severe) vs. normal, and severe vs. non-severe (i.e., normal and mildly and moderately abnormal) BSID-III. 4-Androstene-3,17-dione, testosterone, betaine, xanthine, and lactate were suitable for BSID-III outcome prediction (receiver operating characteristic areas under the curve (AUCs) ≥ 0.6), as well as 68 miRNAs (AUCs of 0.5-0.9). Significant partial correlations of xanthine and betaine levels and the expression of several miRNAs with BSID-III sub-scales were found. Conclusion: We have identified metabolites/miRNAs that might be useful to support the prediction of middle-term neurodevelopmental outcomes of NE. What is known and what is new: • The early prediction of outcomes of neonatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (NE) is of key importance in reducing neonatal mortality and morbidity. • Alterations of the metabolome and miRNAs had been observed in NE. • We performed miRNA sequencing and quantified selected metabolites (i.e., lactate, pyruvate, ketone bodies, Krebs cycle intermediates, tryptophan pathway, hypoxia-related metabolites, and steroids) by GC- and LC-MS. • Specific miRNAs and metabolites that allow prediction of middle-term neurodevelopmental outcomes of newborns with NE undergoing hypothermia treatment were identified.
