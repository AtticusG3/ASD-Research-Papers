# Maternal Hyperandrogenemia and the Long-Term Neuropsychological, Sex Developmental, and Metabolic Effects on Offspring.

## Abstract

Maternal hormonal and metabolic disorders, such as diabetes and obesity, can adversely affect the intrauterine environment, resulting in suboptimal fetal growth and an elevated risk of cardiovascular and metabolic diseases in the later life of the offspring. In this review, we examine the long-term impact of elevated maternal androgen levels during pregnancy on offspring. Maternal hyperandrogenemia is linked to various neurodevelopmental disorders, including attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, autism spectrum disorder, and anxiety-like behaviors, mediated by alterations in key brain regions responsible for emotion and cognition. Furthermore, children born to mothers with hyperandrogenemia exhibit heightened risk of metabolic and cardiovascular dysfunctions, such as obesity, insulin resistance, and hypertension, which can manifest early in life. Prenatal exposure to androgens has also been linked to reduced birth weights and altered fetal growth, potentially due to impaired placental function. Additionally, maternal testosterone levels influence offspring sex ratios, often favoring male births, though exceptions occur in certain conditions, such as congenital adrenal hyperplasia. The findings of this review underscore the need for healthcare professionals to monitor maternal serum androgen profiles during pregnancy. Further research is needed to determine underlying mechanisms and potential interventions to mitigate these risks.
