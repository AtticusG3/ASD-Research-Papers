## Abstract

Safer chemical alternatives to bisphenol (BP) have been a major pursuit of modern green chemistry and toxicology. Using a chemical similarity-based approach, it is difficult to identify minor structural differences that contribute to the significant changes of toxicity. Here, we used omics and computational toxicology to identify chemical features associated with BP analogue-induced embryonic toxicity, offering valuable insights to inform the design of safer chemical alternatives. The zebrafish embryonic acute toxicity, behavioral effects, and concentration-dependent transcriptome analysis of 17 BP analogues were tested, and the chemical structure characteristics and key biological activities-induced embryonic toxicity were explored. BPE, BPF, BPP, BPBP, and BPS induced lower embryonic lethality than BPA. And, 8 BP analogues triggered hyperactive behavior at environmentally and human relevant concentrations. BP analogues with phenol rings linked via hydrophobic segments ("chain:alkaneBranch_neopentyl_C5") disturbed stress response, leading to embryonic lethality, and introducing hydrophobic groups on the meta position of bisphenol structure augmented their embryonic lethality effects. "3DACorr_TotChg_3" of BP analogues is a key physicochemical feature for behavioral disorders, and BP analogues with 3DACorr_TotChg_3 value < 0.11 could induce hyperactive behavior by perturbing neurodevelopment relevant biological pathways. This study provides an integrated strategy, combining data-driven profiling and mechanism-based analysis for safer chemical alternatives.
