## Abstract

Bisphenol A (BPA), a prevalent endocrine-disrupting chemical, is widely found in various consumer products and poses significant health risks, particularly through hormone receptor interactions, oxidative stress, and mitochondrial dysfunction. BPA exposure is associated with reproductive, metabolic, and neurodevelopmental disorders. Melatonin, a neurohormone with strong antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, has emerged as a potential therapeutic agent to counteract the toxic effects of BPA. This review consolidates recent findings from in vitro and animal/preclinical studies, highlighting melatonin's protective mechanisms against BPA-induced toxicity. These include its capacity to reduce oxidative stress, restore mitochondrial function, modulate inflammatory responses, and protect against DNA damage. In animal models, melatonin also mitigates reproductive toxicity, enhances fertility parameters, and reduces histopathological damage. Melatonin's ability to regulate endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and cell death pathways underscores its multifaceted protective role. Despite promising preclinical results, human clinical trials are needed to validate these findings and establish optimal dosages, treatment durations, and safety profiles. This review discusses the wide range of potential uses of melatonin for treating BPA toxicity and suggests directions for future research.
