## Abstract

Prenatal stress exposure irreversibly impairs mitochondrial dynamics, including mitochondrial trafficking and morphology in offspring, leading to neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders in adulthood. Thus, understanding the molecular mechanism controlling mitochondrial dynamics in differentiating neurons is crucial to prevent the prenatal stress-induced impairments in behavior. We investigated the interplay between mitochondrial transport and fusion/fission in differentiating neurons exposed to prenatal stress, leading to ensuing behavior impairments, and then tried to identify the primary regulator that modulates both phenomena. We used primary hippocampal neurons of mice exposed to prenatal stress and human induced-pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived neurons, for investigating the impact of glucocorticoid on mitochondrial dynamics during differentiation. For constructing mouse models, we used AAV vectors into mouse pups exposed to prenatal stress to regulate protein expressions in hippocampal regions. We first observed that prenatal exposure to glucocorticoids induced motility arrest and fragmentation of mitochondria in differentiating neurons derived from mouse fetuses (E18) and human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs). Further, glucocorticoid exposure during neurogenesis selectively downregulated Miro1 and increased Drp1 phosphorylation (Ser616). MIRO1 overexpression restored mitochondrial motility and increased intramitochondrial calcium influx through ER-mitochondria contact (ERMC) formation. Furthermore, we determined that the N-terminal GTPase domain of Miro1 plays a critical role in ERMC formation, which then decreased Drp1 phosphorylation (Ser616). Similarly, prenatal corticosterone exposure led to impaired neuropsychiatric and cognitive function in the offspring by affecting mitochondrial distribution and synaptogenesis, rescued by Miro1 Prenatal glucocorticoid-mediated Miro1 downregulation contributes to dysfunction in mitochondrial dynamics through Drp1 phosphorylation (Ser616) in differentiating neurons.
