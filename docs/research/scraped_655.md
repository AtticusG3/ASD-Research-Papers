## Abstract

Endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) are widespread environmental contaminants that interfere with hormonal regulation, affecting metabolism, reproduction, neurodevelopment, and overall health. This review presents an overview of recent evidence on the health effects and biological mechanisms of EDCs, with a focus on their impact on hormonal balance and quality of life. An integrative literature review was conducted using 28 peer-reviewed articles published between 2020 and 2025, retrieved from databases such as PubMed, Scopus, and ScienceDirect. The selected studies explored the physiological and pathological effects of EDCs in humans. Compounds, such as bisphenol A, phthalates, and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), can mimic or block hormones, disrupt endocrine signaling pathways, and bioaccumulate in tissues. Exposure, especially during critical developmental windows, is linked to metabolic disorders, infertility, neurodevelopmental delays, and hormone-sensitive cancers. Common exposure sources include food, air, household dust, water, and personal care products. Key mechanisms of action involve receptor binding interference, oxidative stress, and epigenetic alterations. EDCs pose a significant and growing threat to public health, warranting urgent regulatory measures, increased public awareness, and continued research to mitigate long-term health consequences.
