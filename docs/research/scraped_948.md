## Abstract

Abstract:
We consider the application of approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) in the context of medical imaging data. We consider the parameter estimation of compartmental models in PET imaging analysis, and provide a simple ABC algorithm for its estimation. We demonstrate the utility of the proposed estimation methods on a neurotransmitter response model, and compare our approach to existing methods.
