## Abstract

Tourette syndrome (TS) is a chronic neurodevelopmental disorder with childhood onset characterized by multiple motor tics and at least one vocal tic, with symptoms persisting for over one year. Its exact etiology remains unclear. Identifying novel therapeutic targets for TS is critically important.
We utilized cis-expression quantitative trait loci (cis-eQTLs) of druggable genes obtained from the eQTLGen Consortium and genome-wide association study (GWAS) data for TS from the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium as the outcome to simulate the effects of pharmacological interventions on TS via Mendelian randomization (MR). Colocalization analyses were then conducted to validate the findings. To further corroborate these results, we investigated the role of DNA methylation in mediating the relationship between druggable gene expression and TS.
The expression of seven druggable genes was significantly associated with TS susceptibility (FDR < 0.05). TS susceptibility and three key genes (RET, CAPNS1, and LAMA5) were likely to share a causal variant. Further DNA methylation analysis identified seven critical methylation sites (cg02605258, cg02907768, cg06026331, cg09831553, cg12382846, cg19674797, and cg20752878), which indirectly influence TS development by regulating LAMA5 gene expression.
LAMA5 is the most promising potential drug target for mitigating TS risk. Our study not only reveals potential therapeutic targets but also provides directions for future TS drug development.

Our study not only reveals potential therapeutic targets but also provides directions for future TS drug development.BackgroundTourette syndrome (TS) is classified as a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by the presence of both motor and phonic tics that persist for over one year. The disorder typically manifests during childhood, with 88% of affected individuals exhibiting comorbid psychiatric conditions such as obsessive‒compulsive disorder (OCD), attention‒deficit‒hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), anxiety, or depressive disorders [1]. TS diminishes quality of life through chronic motor/phonic tics and predisposes individuals to self-injurious behaviors linked to compulsivity and sensorimotor dysregulation [2]. Therapeutic decision-making in pediatric tic disorders frequently faces conflicting symptom management priorities. Notably, pharmacological agents targeting cooccurring ADHD may exacerbate tic severity, whereas antipsychotics pose cognitive impairment risks that restrict their prolonged administration [3]. Second-generation antipsychotics such as aripiprazole demonstrate improved tolerability profiles, yet their clinical adoption remains hindered by insufficient evidence for sustained therapeutic efficacy and unresolved concerns regarding neurodevelopmental safety in pediatric populations [4]. Current etiological hypotheses have not yet been translated into actionable therapeutic targets, whereas the validity of animal models remains limited owing to their inability to replicate subjective experiences such as prodromal urges [5]. Preclinical research is further constrained by the inherent limitations of animal models, which fail to recapitulate clinically salient features such as premonitory urges, thereby diminishing their predictive validity for drug development [5]. These constraints collectively underscore the imperative to identify novel molecular targets capable of addressing both core tic symptomatology and neurodevelopmental trajectories while mitigating the risk–benefit trade-offs inherent to current therapeutic paradigms.Mendelian randomization (MR) employs genetic variants, such as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), closely linked to target exposures as instrumental variables (IVs) and leverages genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary statistics to infer causal relationships between exposures and outcomes [6]. This methodology is grounded in the principle that genetic predisposition is randomly allocated during gamete formation under Mendelian inheritance laws, analogous to randomization in controlled trials, thereby mitigating confounding biases inherent in observational studies [7]. The key strengths of MR include (1) reducing confounding, as genetic variants are assigned independently of postnatal environmental or lifestyle factors under the IV independence assumption; [8](2) eliminating reverse causality, since genetic associations precede disease onset, allowing unambiguous causal inference; [7] and (3) therapeutic target prioritization, by simulating pharmacological interventions through genetic proxies (e.g., protein or metabolite levels) to predict efficacy and adverse effects, thus accelerating drug discovery [9].Expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) represent genomic regions where genetic variants, such as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), are associated with the expression levels of specific genes. These variants may act locally (cis-eQTLs) or distally(Trans-acting expression quantitative trait loci, trans-eQTLs) [10]. Crucially, eQTLs reveal genetic regulatory mechanisms governing gene expression, particularly enabling the functional annotation of disease-associated noncoding variants [11]. Furthermore, eQTLs facilitate candidate gene prioritization for complex traits by integrating GWAS data through colocalization analyses or transcriptome-wide association studies (TWASs) [12]. Colocalization analysis, a complementary approach, determines whether distinct molecular phenotypes (e.g., eQTLs, methylation QTLs [mQTLs], protein QTLs [pQTLs]) or GWAS signals share a causal genetic variant [13]. For example, the colocalization of eQTLs with disease-associated GWAS loci highlights direct regulatory influences on phenotypic outcomes, thereby validating pleiotropic genetic effects [14]. Methylation quantitative trait loci (mQTLs), which reflect genetic influences on DNA methylation levels, capture genotype‒epigenome interactions [11]. Notably, mQTLs reveal the genetic basis of methylation regulation, with some operating independently of eQTLs, thereby providing complementary mechanistic insights [15]. Additionally, the colocalization of mQTLs with eQTLs identifies methylation-mediated gene regulation (epigenetic quantitative trait methylation, eQTM) [16]. Collectively, these approaches advance our understanding of epigenetic contributions to complex traits. In summary, the integration of eQTLs and mQTLs with colocalization enables systematic dissection of genetic regulation across the transcriptional, translational, and epigenetic layers, refining causal inference and accelerating therapeutic discovery.Integrating these insights, our investigation applies MR to systematically prioritize therapeutic candidates for TS from a curated repository of 4479 genes annotated as druggable on the basis of their encoded protein targets or pharmacological relevance. This approach evaluates genetic evidence to identify targets with plausible causal roles in disrupting disease onset or modifying its progression trajectory.MethodsStudy designWe conducted a two-sample Mendelian randomization study to evaluate causal relationships between blood-based cis-eQTLs of druggable genes and Tourette syndrome risk, utilizing genome-wide association summary statistics. Instrumental variables were selected under stringent criteria, with sensitivity analyses applied to validate methodological robustness. Significant candidates underwent integrative assessment via colocalization analyses to distinguish causal associations from confounding associations. Complementary validation included mQTL exploration for epigenetic insights. This multitiered framework harmonizes transcriptional, proteomic, and epigenetic evidence to systematically prioritize therapeutic targets.Exposure dataThe druggable genome encompasses 4479 genes encoding proteins amenable to therapeutic modulation. The integrated GWAS identified 9,178 loci (p≤ 5 × 10⁻⁸), 30% of which were linked to genes encoding therapeutic targets within linkage disequilibrium (LD) intervals. Strikingly, 532 loci were associated with single druggable genes, whereas associations “rediscovered” 74 licensed drug targets through disease-biomarker concordance (e.g., HMGCR for statins). Conversely, 1,523 phenotype-indication mismatches suggested repurposing opportunities. To address incomplete variant coverage in conventional arrays, the Illumina DrugDev Array (182,375 custom SNPs) optimizes coding (2.5 SNPs/kbp) and tagging efficiency for druggable genes across populations. This platform aids Mendelian randomization studies, modeling pharmacological effects via cis-regulatory variants. Systematic alignment of GWAS loci, drug targets, and compounds advances precision in target validation, reduces late-stage attrition, and unlocks novel therapeutic avenues [17]. Through genome-wide profiling of blood-derived transcriptomes across 31,684 individuals (primarily European-ancestry participants, aggregated from 37 independent cohorts), the eQTLGen Consortium enabled systematic cis-regulatory mapping targeting gene-proximal variants (spanning ± 1 Mb of transcription start/end sites) with allele frequencies exceeding 1%. Analysis revealed significant cis-eQTLs (FDR < 0.05) for only 56% (2,525) of the 4,479 computationally predicted druggable genes, potentially reflecting dynamic regulatory constraints on therapeutic targets or analytical limitations in detecting low-penetrance effects [18].Instrumental variable (IV) selectionThe three core assumptions underpinning MR analyses are as follows. First, the Relevance assumption stipulates that genetic variants (e.g., SNPs) must exhibit a strong association with the exposure of interest, ensuring that the selected SNPs effectively represent the genetic effects of the exposure. Second, the independence assumption requires genetic instruments to remain independent of potential confounders influencing both the exposure and outcome, thereby mitigating confounding bias. Third, the exclusion restriction principle mandates that SNPs must affect the outcome exclusively through their association with the exposure, precluding horizontal pleiotropy or alternative causal pathways (e.g., direct or indirect effects unrelated to the exposure). These assumptions collectively safeguard the validity of MR as an instrumental variable approach for inferring causal relationships in observational studies [19]. In accordance with these principles, a stringent selection protocol was established for druggable genes in our analysis. First, cis-eQTLs were prioritized by applying a genome-wide significance threshold (P< 5.0 × 10 − 8). To ensure genetic instrument independence, SNPs associated with each druggable gene were subsequently clumped using reference data from the 1,000 Genomes Project European cohort. This procedure employed an LD threshold of r² < 0.1 and a clumping window of 10,000 kilobases (kb) to eliminate correlated variants. Collectively, these steps optimize the validity of instrumental variables by addressing pleiotropy and confounding while maintaining robust genetic associations with target exposures [20]. During SNP harmonization, allele mismatches between the exposure and outcome datasets (e.g., A/G vs. A/C) were systematically discarded. For palindromic SNPs, allele alignment relies on frequency-based inference of forward-strand alleles; loci lacking unambiguous allele frequency data are excluded entirely to minimize ambiguity. To evaluate instrument strength and mitigate weak instrument bias, F statistics—a measure of the genetic instruments’ association strength with the exposure—were calculated. Variants with F statistics less than 20 were rigorously filtered from subsequent analyses, aligning with established thresholds for robust causal inference in Mendelian randomization frameworks [21].Outcome dataGWAS data on susceptibility to TS and disease progression were obtained from the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium. For the TS susceptibility GWAS, a meta-analysis of four studies comprising a total of 4,819 Tourette’s syndrome cases and 9,488 controls was performed [22].Mendelian randomization and colocalizationMR analyses were conducted via the R package “TwoSampleMR” (version 0.5.6), which employs five MR methods: inverse variance weighted (IVW), MR‒Egger, weighted median, simple mode, and weighted mode. To control for false positives arising from multiple hypothesis testing, false discovery rate (FDR) correction was applied, thereby enhancing the reliability of causal inferences. Sensitivity analyses were further performed to assess potential biases, including horizontal pleiotropy and instrumental variable heterogeneity, and to validate the robustness of the causal estimates. Horizontal pleiotropy was evaluated via MR‒Egger regression, where a statistically significant intercept term (p< 0.05) indicated bias, rendering the results unreliable [23]. Heterogeneity across instrumental variables was quantified via Cochran’s Q test, with a significant Q statistic (p< 0.05) suggesting heterogeneity [24].For druggable genes exhibiting significant MR findings, colocalization analysis was conducted via the R package “coloc” (v5.1.0.1) [25], with default prior probabilities set as P1 = 1.0 × 10 − 10 (SNP associated with druggable gene expression), P2 = 1.0 × 10 − 10 (SNP associated with outcome), and P12 = 1.0 × 10 − 10 (SNP associated with both). Five posterior probability hypotheses (PPHs) were evaluated: PPH0 (no association with either expression or outcome), PPH1 (associated with expression only), PPH2 (associated with outcome only), PPH3 (distinct causal variants for expression and outcome), and PPH4 (shared causal variant for both). A PPH4 threshold > 0.80 provided robust evidence of colocalization, prioritizing genes colocalized with TS as potential therapeutic targets. The lead exposure-associated variant (lowest P value) was selected as the reference, with variants within ± 500 kb included in the analysis [26].ResultsA total of 40,356 SNPs met the IV selection criteria and were mapped to 2,534 druggable genes. All the retained SNPs presented F statistics > 20, confirming robust instrument strength and negligible weak instrument bias.Mendelian randomizationUsing the IVW method, we identified 12 druggable genes whose expression levels were significantly associated with TS susceptibility after FDR correction (FDR < 0.05). Cochran’s Q test revealed no evidence of heterogeneity or horizontal pleiotropy among the IVs for these genes. (see Additional file1). The associated forest plot can be found in Fig.1.Fig. 1Significant MR results between the expression of druggable genes and TS susceptibility after FDR correctionFull size imageColocalizationFor druggable genes with significant MR signals, colocalization analysis was performed to estimate the probability of shared causal variants between cis-eQTLs and TS susceptibility. The analysis revealed strong evidence (posterior probability for hypothesis 4 [PP.H4] > 75%) of colocalization with TS for three genes, RET (PP.H4 = 95.31%), CAPNS1 (PP.H4 = 77.53%) and LAMA5 (PP.H4 = 77.36%), suggesting a shared causal variant. In contrast, no colocalization signal was observed between these genes and TS progression. On the basis of integrated Mendelian randomization and colocalization evidence, RET was identified as a potential therapeutic target for TS risk reduction through its inhibitory effects, whereas CAPNS1 and LAMA5 emerged as risk-promoting genes requiring suppression to mitigate TS pathogenesis. (see Additional file2)DNA Methylation-eQTL-TS relationshipMethylation site information for the RET, CAPNS1, and LAMA5 genes was obtained from the mQTLdb database (http://mqtldb.godmc.org.uk/downloads) [27]. To minimize potential bias and ensure methodological consistency in the MR analysis, we excluded CAPNS1 (which had no methylation sites) and RET (which contained only one methylation site), retaining only LAMA5 for further investigation. The MR results revealed eight methylation sites that significantly influence LAMA5 expression. Sensitivity analyses demonstrated no evidence of heterogeneity via Cochran’s Q test, whereas MR‒Egger regression indicated horizontal pleiotropy for one methylation site (cg12382846), which was subsequently excluded. After removal, seven methylation sites remained significant: cg02605258 (OR = 1.402, 95% CI: 1.090–1.804,p= 0.009), cg02907768 (OR = 0.706, 95% CI: 0.573–0.870,p= 0.001), cg06026331 (OR = 0.884, 95% CI: 0.808–0.968,p= 0.008), cg09831553 (OR = 0.711, 95% CI: 0.510–0.991,p= 0.044), cg12382846 (OR = 0.857, 95% CI: 0.742–0.989,p= 0.035), cg19674797 (OR = 1.184, 95% CI: 1.020–1.374,p= 0.027), and cg20752878 (OR = 0.648, 95% CI: 0.562–0.748,p= 2.610 × 10 − 9). (see Additional file3)DiscussionIn this study, we employed two-sample MR and DNA methylation analysis to investigate the causal relationship between eQTLs and TS. Our results revealed a significant association between elevated expression of LAMA5 and increased TS risk, which was mediated by DNA methylations. These findings provide novel insights into the pathogenesis of TS and suggest potential clinical applications, including the development of LAMA5 as a diagnostic biomarker or therapeutic target for TS.LAMA5 (laminin α5) encodes laminin α5, a critical component of the basement membrane, particularly in the glomerular basement membrane, where it plays essential roles in structural integrity and cellular signaling [28,29]. As a member of the laminin family, LAMA5 regulates cell adhesion, differentiation, and tissue development across multiple biological systems [30]. Its dynamic interaction with extracellular matrices underscores its broad impact on organogenesis and homeostasis.In nonneural contexts, mutations in LAMA5 have been linked to hereditary nephropathies, including focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), end-stage kidney disease (ESKD), and diffuse mesangial sclerosis (DMS) [28,29,31]. Affected individuals often carry heterozygous or homozygous LAMA5 variants and exhibit familial clustering of renal disorders [28,31]. This dual implication in both neurodevelopmental and renal pathologies highlights the pleiotropic functional importance of LAMA5 across organ systems.While direct evidence linking LAMA5 to TS pathogenesis remains elusive, its plausible mechanisms can be inferred from existing biological and clinical insights. First, LAMA5 encodes laminin α5, a critical component of basement membranes known for its structural role in the glomerular basement membrane [32]. Basement membranes are indispensable for neurodevelopment and neuronal migration—processes tightly linked to TS pathophysiology, which centers on aberrant development of the cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical (CSTC) circuit [2,33]. Although not studied directly in TS, genetic perturbations in LAMA5 might compromise basement membrane integrity, potentially disrupting neural circuit formation or synaptic maturation, thereby contributing to the neurodevelopmental anomalies observed in TS.Expanding the scope to systemic associations, LAMA5 variants also exhibit connections with nonneurological disorders. For example, heterozygous LAMA5 mutations are correlated with FSGS and end-stage renal disease3, indicating its broader role in multisystem regulation. Notably, TS frequently co-occurs with neurodevelopmental comorbidities such as ADHD and autism spectrum disorder [34], suggesting shared genetic susceptibility across developmental pathways. As a ubiquitous basement membrane protein, systemic dysfunction of LAMA5 could align with the polygenic and multifactorial nature of TS, where subtle defects in diverse biological systems may collectively drive pathogenesis.Finally, emerging evidence suggests that immune modulation is another plausible mechanism. Animal studies indicate that Lama5 regulates CD4 + T-cell differentiation and migration, influencing immune reactivity30, a pathway of interest given prior hypotheses linking immune dysregulation (e.g., poststreptococcal autoimmunity) to TS [35]. While speculative, LAMA5 might indirectly modulate neuroimmune interactions in TS, potentially via effects on blood‒brain barrier integrity or neuroinflammatory signaling. These putative roles, spanning structural, systemic, and immune domains, position LAMA5 as a candidate gene warrant further investigation in TS etiology.This study has several notable strengths. First, the application of MR strengthened causal inference by mitigating biases and reverse causality commonly observed in conventional observational studies. Second, applying MR corroborated the role of LAMA5 in TS and highlighted the influence of DNA methylations, enhancing the reliability and depth of our findings. Additionally, the use of large-scale datasets encompassing 4,819 TS cases and 9,488 controls ensured the robustness and generalizability of the conclusions.Despite these strengths, several limitations warrant attention. First, the reliance on datasets derived primarily from European populations may limit the generalizability of the results to other ethnic groups, necessitating validation in more diverse cohorts. Second, the lack of experimental validation (e.g., in vitro cellular models or animal studies) for LAMA5 expression and methylation sites remains a critical gap. Third, environmental factors and their potential interactions with epigenetic modifications were not addressed, even though such interactions may play pivotal roles in TS pathogenesis. Finally, whether LAMA5 methylation can serve as an early diagnostic biomarker or therapeutic target requires further validation through large-scale clinical studies.ConclusionThis study revealed, through MR, an association between DNA methylation and LAMA5 gene expression during TS progression. These findings provide novel insights into the pathogenesis of TS, demonstrating the role of DNA methylation as a crucial epigenetic modification in this disorder.Data availabilityThe cis-eQTL data were obtained from the eQTLGen Consortium (https://www.eqtlgen.org/cis-eqtls.html) [36].
