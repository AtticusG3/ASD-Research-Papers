## Abstract

Tourette syndrome (TS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by impaired or delayed functional development. Although the pathology of TS remains to be determined, the continuous development of science and technology has provided new perspectives to understand its pathological mechanism. Research into non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) techniques, such as transcranial magnetic stimulation and direct current stimulation, have shown promising therapeutic potential in clinical studies. Furthermore, NIBS has been shown to affect the brain of patients with TS, including synaptic transmission, release of neurotransmitters, in addition to the activation of microglial cells and astrocytes. However, an exploration of the innate mechanisms is still lacking. This review aims to summarize the pathogenesis of TS and intervention with NIBS in clinical patients with TS. It aims to provide a theoretical basis for more in-depth investigations of innovative therapies for TS in the future.
