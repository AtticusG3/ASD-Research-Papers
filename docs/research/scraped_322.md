## Abstract

In the last decades, growing caseness for Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) has been observed, owing to the diagnostic accretion of low-impairment forms, over and above other possible causes. Unrecognized ASD is likely to be mislabeled as a psychotic disorder (PD), as people in the spectrum may show 'pseudopsychotic' symptoms, resembling both negative and positive symptoms. On the other hand, PDs are likely to be overlooked when they arise in people with ASD, due to the 'diagnostic overshadowing' of new-onset conditions by lifelong core autistic symptoms. The three available metanalyses on the occurrence of psychosis in adults with ASD convergently reported a rate of PDs that is at least ten times higher than in the general population. Therefore, the lack of literature addressing risk factors, outcomes, and treatment options for psychosis in the context of ASD is utterly concerning. The present review aims to summarize up-to-date knowledge of PDs with comorbid ASD in terms of clinical features, course, and treatment.
