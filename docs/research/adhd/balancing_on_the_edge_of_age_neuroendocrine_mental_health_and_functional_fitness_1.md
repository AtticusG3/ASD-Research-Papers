## Abstract

Fear of Falling (FOF) is a common and natural behavior experienced by most of the elderly population during aging. It is thought to be caused by previous falls, dizziness, depression, and neuromotor impairments. However, the association between FOF and salivary biomarkers such as Cortisol (COR), Testosterone (TT), Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), and alpha-amylase activities has not been consistently explored.
To explore the association between FOF and general health status, Functional Fitness (FF), and salivary-related stress biomarkers in institutionalized older women.
A total of 278 older women were assessed and grouped as having Higher (n = 176) or Lower FOF (n = 102), according to the Falls Efficacy Scale. Saliva samples were collected.
