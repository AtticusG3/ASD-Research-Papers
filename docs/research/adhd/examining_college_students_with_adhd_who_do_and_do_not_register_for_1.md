## Abstract

The number of college students with ADHD is growing but challenges remain in the full inclusion of these students with ADHD in higher education settings in the United States. The results of the current study indicate that only 1 in 3 college students with ADHD registered for accommodations utilizing data from the Healthy Minds Study across the United States. There were some differences in who registered for accommodations among college students with ADHD such as that students who reported being male being less likely to register and students receiving medication being more likely to register. When statistically controlling for comorbid disorders, severity of ADHD, and whether they received stimulant medications, college students with ADHD who registered for accommodations reported a lower number of illicit substances used than college students with ADHD who did not register for accommodations.
