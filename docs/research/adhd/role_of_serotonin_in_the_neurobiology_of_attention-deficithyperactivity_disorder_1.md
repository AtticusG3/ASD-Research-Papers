## Abstract

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common neuropsychiatric disorder of inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity. Roles for dopamine and norepinephrine are widely recognized; however, the role of serotonergic neurotransmission is less clear. This systematic literature review aimed to determine if changes in serotonin transmission are implicated in the neurobiology of ADHD.
A search of published literature was conducted. Eligible publications addressing the role of serotonin, its receptor family, and/or its transporter in the neurobiology of ADHD were selected according to prespecified criteria. The quality of evidence was graded.
Of 95 publications meeting our criteria, many (
Substantial evidence implicates serotonin in the neurobiology of ADHD and in the regulation of the catecholaminergic systems believed to be dysregulated by the disorder. Yet this evidence is incomplete and, at times, conflicting. It does suggest, however, that medications that engage the serotonin system should be tested for their efficacy in the treatment of ADHD.
Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common disorder. Individuals with ADHD can have symptoms of inattention, impulsivity, and hyperactivity, and often need medication to help with behavior, address deficits at school or work, and avoid the many life impairments associated with the disorder. ADHD can occur from genetic alterations or environmental factors which can cause changes in the brain. Chemicals in the brain called neurotransmitters carry messages, and one neurotransmitter, called serotonin, may be an important factor in ADHD. To address this issue, we (1) searched published scientific articles about the role of serotonin in ADHD, (2) cataloged the types of evidence (for example, did it come from humans with ADHD or from animal models), and (3) identified how strong the evidence was. This search found 95 articles that looked at the potential link between serotonin and ADHD, of which 77 (81%) supported a role for serotonin. A full understanding of all processes involved in ADHD is not yet known, but overall, this study confirms that serotonin is likely to be involved in ADHD, making it a good target for future medications to help manage the symptoms.
