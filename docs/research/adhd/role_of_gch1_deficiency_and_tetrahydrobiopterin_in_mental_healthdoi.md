## Abstract

Treatment-resistant mental health concerns significantly contribute to society in terms of financial costs and individually by creating emotional and functional costs. An important yet little-recognized cause of treatment-resistant mental health conditions is tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) deficiency. BH4 is an essential cofactor for producing serotonin, dopamine, norepinephrine, and nitric oxide-molecules critical to mood and focus. The enzyme GTP Cyclohydrolase 1 (GCH1), produced by a gene of the same name, catalyzes the first step in synthesizing BH4. Variants in this gene have been associated with low BH4 levels, as well as depression and ADHD. The case reports presented in this article illustrate that a partial BH4 deficiency, as conveyed by the

An important yet little-recognized cause of treatment-resistant mental health conditions is tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) deficiency. BH4 is an essential cofactor for producing serotonin, dopamine, norepinephrine, and nitric oxide-molecules critical to mood and focus. The enzyme GTP Cyclohydrolase 1 (GCH1), produced by a gene of the same name, catalyzes the first step in synthesizing BH4. Variants in this gene have been associated with low BH4 levels, as well as depression and ADHD. The case reports presented in this article illustrate that a partial BH4 deficiency, as conveyed by theGCH1rs841 variant, may contribute to wider issues in mental and neurological health including depression and ADHD but also severe treatment-resistant anxiety, Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder, insomnia, complex behavioral issues, and autism. The effects of GCH1-mediated BH4 deficiency may be able to be rescued with a low-dose BH4 replacement, as illustrated by these cases, where substantial observational improvements in mental health concerns were reported in all five cases. This paper also demonstrates how a genomics clinical decision support tool can non-invasively flag "low producers" by identifying individuals with the AA genotype forGCH1rs841, as well as other modifiable genomic contributing factors to mental health concerns. These cases broaden the understanding of BH4's psychiatric relevance and also serve to further the medical literature by documenting positive responses to low-dose BH4 (ranging from 0.09 to 0.3 mg/kg/day) and other genotype-guided interventions across diverse mental and neurological health presentations, highlighting the potential benefits and importance of a genomically targeted, precision approach to psychiatry.Keywords:BH4; GCH1; anxiety; clinical decision support tool; depression; genomics; mental health; neurotransmitters; personalized psychiatry; precision medicine; tetrahydrobiopterin.---
