## Abstract

Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and its pharmacological treatments may influence growth in children and adolescents. This meta-analysis aimed to clarify their effects on the physical development, especially weight and height. To investigate the effects of ADHD and its treatment on growth in children and adolescents. Researchers reviewed 18 studies published up to September 2023 from databases such as PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane, and Web of Science. They analyzed changes in body weight, height, and body mass index (BMI) before and after ADHD treatment, along with the risks of overweight and obesity. Children with ADHD undergoing long-term medication therapy showed decreased actual weight [weighted mean difference (WMD) = -9.50] and height (WMD = -0.15), along with a slight increase in weight standard deviation scores (WMD = 0.23) and height z scores (WMD = 0.10). BMI showed a non-significant downward trend (WMD = -1.72). Regarding overweight and obesity risks, the pooled odds ratios were 1.37 and 1.16, respectively, but these were not statistically significant. Overall, the study suggests that long-term pharmacological treatment for ADHD may be associated with reduced growth in weight and height among young patients. However, no clear link was found between ADHD and increased risk of overweight or obesity. These findings highlight the importance of monitoring growth in children receiving medication for ADHD.
