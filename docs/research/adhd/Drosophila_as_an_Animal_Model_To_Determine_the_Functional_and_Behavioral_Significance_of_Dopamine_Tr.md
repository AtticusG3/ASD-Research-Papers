## Abstract

Drosophila melanogaster, commonly referred to as the "fruit fly," has been a long-utilized animal model in multiple areas of biological research. It is estimated that 75% of human genes, which are associated with disease, have homologues in Drosophila. The conservation of biological systems, the genetic tractability, short generation time, and a broad array of available behavioral assessments make Drosophila an especially robust model organism for neuroscience investigations. The dopamine (DA) system, in particular, is highly conserved between mammals and Drosophila. Mutations of the DA transporter (DAT), a negative regulator of DA neurotransmission, have been associated with multiple different neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders, including autism spectrum disorders (ASDs), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and Parkinson's disease (PD). Utilization of Drosophila models demonstrates specific structural and functional alterations in mutated DAT that manifest as unique behavioral phenotypes. Ultimately, combining techniques ranging from biochemistry, electrochemistry, and complex behavioral analyses facilitated a deeper understanding of how transporter function and dysfunction can translate to neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders.
