## Abstract

Aberrant dopamine (DA) signaling is implicated in schizophrenia, bipolar disorder (BPD), autism spectrum disorder (ASD), substance use disorder, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Treatment of these disorders remains inadequate, as exemplified by the therapeutic use of d-amphetamine and methylphenidate for the treatment of ADHD, agents with high abuse liability. In search for an improved and non-addictive therapeutic approach for the treatment of DA-linked disorders, we utilized a preclinical mouse model expressing the human DA transporter (DAT) coding variant DAT Val559, previously identified in individuals with ADHD, ASD, or BPD. DAT Val559, like several other disease-associated variants of DAT, exhibits anomalous DA efflux (ADE) that can be blocked by d-amphetamine and methylphenidate. Kappa opioid receptors (KORs) are expressed by DA neurons and modulate DA release and clearance, suggesting that targeting KORs might also provide an alternative approach to normalizing DA-signaling disrupted by perturbed DAT function. Here we demonstrate that KOR stimulation leads to enhanced surface trafficking and phosphorylation of Thr53 in wildtype DAT, effects achieved constitutively by the Val559 mutant. Moreover, these effects can be rescued by KOR antagonism of DAT Val559 in ex vivo preparations. Importantly, KOR antagonism also corrected in vivo DA release as well as sex-dependent behavioral abnormalities observed in DAT Val559 mice. Given their low abuse liability, our studies with a construct valid model of human DA associated disorders reinforce considerations of KOR antagonism as a pharmacological strategy to treat DA associated brain disorders.
