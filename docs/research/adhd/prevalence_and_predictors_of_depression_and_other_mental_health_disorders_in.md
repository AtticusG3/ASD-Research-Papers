## Abstract

To investigate the occurrence of depression and mental health disorders other than depression among Brazilian people with intellectual disabilities, analysing data from a national household survey.
Cross-sectional epidemiological study using data from the 2019 National Health Survey (PNS).
Brazil, nationwide data collection in urban and rural private households.
272 499 individuals, among whom 1.2% (n=3198) reported intellectual disabilities.
Self-reported depression and mental health disorders other than depression (anxiety, panic, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, psychosis or obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD)), either isolated or comorbid.
Among people with intellectual disabilities, 43.2% reported at least one mental health disorder versus 13.7% without disabilities. In adults aged 0-59 years, intellectual disability was associated with higher odds of depression (adjusted OR (aOR) 3.25, 95% CI 1.76 to 6.00), mental health disorders other than depression (aOR 12.23, 95% CI 7.52 to 19.90) and depression associated with other mental health disorders (aOR 14.34, 95% CI 7.92 to 25.96). In older adults (≥60 years), risks also remained elevated: depression (aOR 1.71, 95% CI 1.04 to 2.79), mental health disorders other than depression (aOR 4.33, 95% CI 2.09 to 8.94) and depression associated with other mental health disorders (aOR 2.98, 95% CI 1.49 to 5.95). Women with intellectual disabilities were more likely to report depression and multimorbidity, while men more often reported non-depressive disorders. Poorer self-perceived health was consistently linked to worse outcomes across age groups.
Mental health disorders and their comorbidities are significantly more prevalent among people with intellectual disabilities in Brazil. These findings highlight the urgent need for inclusive, equitable and specialised mental healthcare policies.

health research. outcomes based on self-reports, which may be influenced by proxy responses and interpretation. lack of standardised diagnostic tools may lead to underestimation or overestimation of prevalence. cross-sectional design prevents causal inference. introduction estimates by the brazilian institute of geography and statistics (ibge), based on the 2022 continuous national household sample survey (pnad), indicate that there are 18.6 million people with disabilities in brazil, considering the population aged 2 years and older. according to the pesquisa nacional em saúde (2019), people with intellectual disabilities are distributed across various regions of the country, with a higher prevalence in areas with greater population density, such as the southeast and south. analysing the distribution of these individuals by region, they are most concentrated in são paulo in the southeast, pará in the north, bahia in the northeast, goiás in the midwest and rio grande do sul in the south (pns, 2019). 1 the development of policies promoting the health rights of people with disabilities in brazil has a history rooted in philanthropy and fragmented initiatives. over the past 50 years, different groups, such as the disability rights movement, experts, philanthropic institutions, international organisations and governments of diverse political ideologies, have advocated for and shaped these efforts. 2 despite advancements, a lack of adequate funding has hindered the brazilian national policy for comprehensive healthcare for people with disabilities. in addition, the network of care for people with disabilities, which operates within the brazilian unified health system (sus), also faces similar financial constraints. this underfunding contrasts with the country’s ambitious economic and social agendas, which strive for economic growth, poverty eradication and improved social and health indicators. 3 in brazil, mental health has become a well-established state public policy, implemented through a legal framework based on the redes de atenção psicossocial (raps) model. this model aims to expand access to and improve the quality of psychosocial care, encompassing services like núcleos de apoio à saúde da família, centros de atenção psicossocial, community centres and mental health beds in general hospitals. however, research has consistently shown that individuals with intellectual disabilities face significant barriers in accessing mental services. these barriers include a lack of professional training, limited accessibility to services and the dependency of many individuals with intellectual disabilities on others to navigate the care system. 4 population-based studies in high-income countries have consistently shown that individuals with intellectual disabilities are more vulnerable to mental health problems compared with the general population, with prevalence rates ranging from 12.8% in children to 23.4% in adults and 27.2% in older adults. 5 intellectual disability is a strong predictor of psychiatric conditions (or=7.1), 5 and prevalence estimates of mental illness in adults range between 14% and 41%, with disproportionately high rates of schizophrenia, phobic disorders and psychosis compared with the non-disabled population. 6 7 among children and adolescents, psychiatric disorders affect 30%–50%, with rates of 36% reported in the uk compared with only 8% among peers without intellectual disabilities. 5–7 moreover, anxiety, conduct disorders and hyperactivity are more frequent in this population. 8 9 in contrast, the scarcity of similar data in latin america highlights an urgent research gap, impeding the development of targeted policies and the removal of barriers to service delivery. 10 11 these health disparities demand public health attention, as the presence of multiple comorbidities further increases the risk of mental disorders and exacerbates health inequalities. 12 13 since access to healthcare is a key mechanism for identifying and addressing social inequalities, this manuscript aims to investigate the occurrence of depression and other mental health disorders associated with intellectual disability in brazil by analysing data from a national household survey 1 conducted in a middle-to-low-income country. methods design this is a cross-sectional epidemiological study based on secondary data from the national survey of health, 1 a population-based survey conducted in 2019 by the ibge in partnership with the ministry of health. the pns is part of the ibge’s integrated system of household surveys (sipd) and aims to obtain nationwide information on the health situation, lifestyles and healthcare of the adult brazilian population living in private households, in urban and rural areas, excluding special census tracts (barracks, military bases, lodgings, camps, boats, penitentiaries, penal colonies, prisons, jails, nursing homes, orphanages, convents and hospitals). the pns is a household-based survey with a three-stage cluster sampling plan, with stratification of the primary sampling units (upas (unidades primárias de amostragem)). census tracts are the primary sampling units; households are the secondary units and residents aged 15 and over are the tertiary units. households and residents were selected by simple random sampling. the sample was estimated at 108 525 households. information was collected from 94 114 households, with 90 846 residents aged 15 or over responding to the individual questionnaire, giving a final response rate of 96.5%. the interviews were conducted between august 2019 and march 2020. the information was collected by trained interviewers and recorded on mobile collection devices, smartphones, programmed with the survey questionnaire and the processes for analysing the variables. after explaining the study, the objectives and the importance of participating in the interview, a questionnaire was administered to the individual aged 15 or over selected in the household. the questionnaire included questions on sociodemographic characteristics, self-rated health, lifestyles, chronic diseases and oral health. weight and height measurements were also taken. if the person with intellectual disability could not directly participate in the interview, the information was obtained from proxy respondents, such as family members or close caregivers. these informants answered the same set of questions on behalf of the participant, without any modifications to the content or the mode of administration. this approach ensured comparability of responses and enabled the inclusion of participants who otherwise could not have been represented in the study. more detailed descriptions of the sampling process and data collection methods can be found in the pns 2019 report, available online on the ibge website. the data were accessed on 21 june 2023 ( https://www.pns.icict.fiocruz.br/bases-de-dados/ ). self-reported intellectual disabilities the following identifying variable is used to identify people with intellectual disabilities in the pns: ‘due to some limitation in mental or intellectual functions, does ___ have a permanent difficulty performing usual activities, such as communicating, performing personal care, working, attending school, playing, etc? (for residents aged 5 years or older)’ or ‘due to some limitation in mental or intellectual functions, does ___ have a permanent difficulty performing usual activities, such as attending school, playing, etc? (for residents aged 2 to 4 years).’ the pns considers people with intellectual disabilities to be those who ‘reported having great difficulty or being completely unable to perform usual activities, such as communicating, performing personal care, working, attending school, playing, etc, due to some limitation in mental/intellectual functions’. outcome: depression and mental health disorders other than depression self-report measures of depression in the pns were obtained through the following variable: ‘has a doctor or mental health professional (such as a psychiatrist or psychologist) ever given you a diagnosis of depression?’ (no/yes). self-report of mental health disorders other than depression (anxiety, panic, schizophrenia, bipolar, psychosis or ocd) was obtained by the variable: ‘has a doctor or health professional (such as a psychiatrist or psychologist) ever given you a diagnosis of another mental illness, such as anxiety disorder, panic disorder, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, psychosis or ocd (obsessive-compulsive disorder), etc?’ (no/yes) the outcome variable for mental health was constructed from the association between self-reported depression and self-reported mental health disorders other than depression and was categorised as: no mental health disorder/depression/mental health disorders other than depression/depression associated with other mental health disorders. characteristics of the individual, social environment and health the following variables were analysed: self-reported sociodemographic characteristics (sex (female/male); race (white/black/asian/brown/indigenous); age (0–18/19–59/>60); marital status (single/married/divorced/separated/widowed); education (illiterate/elementary/high school/college/postgraduate)). self-reported health characteristics (self-perceived health (very good/good/fair/poor/very bad); mental healthcare frequency (never visits/only when problems arise/regularly); reasons for not seeking mental health services (no longer depressed/too far/lack of motivation to seek help/long waiting times/general difficulty/incompatible schedule/cannot get an appointment via health plan/does not know whom to consult/other reason). the occurrence of stroke (no/yes) was assessed to control for potential confounding factors. statistical analysis descriptive analyses were conducted on the sociodemographic and health characteristics of brazilian individuals with intellectual disabilities. comparisons were performed using pearson’s χ² test with the rao-scott correction. 13 the description incorporated weights to adjust for different selection probabilities of the participants, and the results were expressed as weighted values. all p values <0.05 were considered statistically significant. the survey (svy) package in stata v.17 was used, providing procedures for analysing complex sample data. this software allowed the incorporation of different observation weights that could influence the parameter estimates for the total population, accounting for the effect of sampling on variance estimates. the pns does not differentiate intellectual disability present since birth. to minimise potential selection bias between individuals with intellectual disability present since birth and those with cognitive conditions acquired later in life (e.g., due to stroke or age-related conditions), we stratified the population into two age groups: 0–59 years and ≥60 years a multinomial logistic regression was used to analyse association between self-reported mental health disorders and intellectual disability. associations with a p<0.2 in the univariate analyses were included in the multinomial logistic regression using a forward selection approach. the strength of the associations was estimated through ors and their corresponding 95% cis. results of the 272 499 pns interviewees, only 1.2% (n=3198) had intellectual disabilities. the sample of people with intellectual disabilities was composed mainly of individuals aged 19–59 years, single, illiterate, without self-reported mental health disorders. despite this, they regularly attended mental health services. approximately 20% of the sample reported having suffered a stroke and 37.2% reported that their health status was regular ( table 1 ). view this table: view inline view popup table 1 sociodemographic and health characteristics of brazilian individuals with intellectual disabilities (n=272 499) nearly half of participants with intellectual disability (43.2%) had at least one mental health disorder diagnosis, compared with only 13.7% of those without intellectual disability ( table 1 ). table 2 presents the results of the associations between sociodemographic variables by age strata. women with intellectual disabilities showed higher prevalences of depression and depression associated with other mental health disorders compared with men, both among adults (0–59 years) and older adults (≥60 years). regarding marital status, single adults concentrated a higher proportion of diagnoses of depression and other mental health disorders, while among older adults, widowhood was associated with a higher burden of disorders and comorbidities. although no statistically significant differences were found by race/skin colour, brown and black individuals were more represented among the cases of mental health disorders. with respect to education, among younger adults, depression was more frequent in those with high school education, while illiteracy was associated with poorer self-perceived health and possible underdiagnosis. view this table: view inline view popup table 2 sociodemographic and health characteristics of individuals with intellectual disabilities among the health conditions assessed, no significant differences were observed in the occurrence of mental health disorders among adults who reported having had a stroke; however, among older adults, those with a history of stroke showed a higher prevalence of depression, suggesting an interaction between physical sequelae, functional dependence and increased risk of mental health disorders. regarding self-perceived health, a consistent association was found between poorer health perception and a higher prevalence of depression and other mental health disorders across all age groups, confirming this subjective indicator as a robust marker of vulnerability to mental health problems ( table 2 ). in the multinomial logistic regression analyses ( table 3 ), adults aged 0–59 years with intellectual disabilities had a 3.25-fold higher likelihood of depression (95% ci 1.76 to 6.00), a 12.23-fold higher likelihood of other mental health disorders (95% ci 7.52 to 19.90) and an extremely elevated adjusted or of 14.34 (95% ci 7.92 to 25.96) for the combination of depression and other disorders, indicating that intellectual disability is a strong predictor of psychiatric multimorbidity in younger adults. among older adults (≥60 years), intellectual disabilities remained significantly associated with mental health outcomes, with a 1.71-fold higher risk of depression (95% ci 1.04 to 2.79), a 4.33-fold higher risk of other disorders (95% ci 2.09 to 8.94) and a 2.98-fold higher risk of combined depression and other disorders (95% ci 1.49 to 5.95). view this table: view inline view popup table 3 estimates of crude and adjusted ors (aor) of mental health disorders according to intellectual disabilities, by age (n=3198)‡ discussion the prevalence of intellectual disability in brazil, as determined by our study, is 1.2%. the distribution of self-reported intellectual disabilities is notably higher within the age cohort under 59 years, a demographic where intellectual disability is less likely to be an acquired condition (eg, due to a stroke). this finding supports the representativeness of our sample and suggests that our study design successfully mitigated selection bias. among them, adults were notably more represented (46.0%), with about 20% having suffered a stroke. depressive disorders and comorbidities between depression and mental health disorders other than depression were more frequent among elderly brazilian women with intellectual disabilities, while mental health disorders other than depression were more common among men with intellectual disabilities. however, our findings highlight the high likelihood of mental health disorders occurring among brazilian people with intellectual disabilities, as well as the occurrence of comorbidities between depression and mental health disorders other than depression being approximately eight times higher when compared with the population without intellectual disabilities. the occurrence of mental health disorders among the brazilian population with intellectual disabilities is significantly higher than what has been found in other countries. a scoping review of 100 articles 14 found that the risk of developing mental disorders for people with intellectual disabilities is 3–4 times higher than the general population, despite frequent underdiagnosis and misdiagnoses, due to atypical symptom presentations, challenges in communication with patients and lack of adapted diagnostic tools. in our study, the chance of these outcomes occurring was 6–8 times higher. this could be attributed to the fact that the pns is a self-reported survey, meaning that self-declaration of intellectual disability may be either underestimated or overestimated, due to proxy responses or misunderstanding of the questions posed by interviewers. studies have shown that individuals with intellectual disabilities can provide reliable self-reports, but often require support, such as simplification of questions and the use of visual alternatives, which was not provided in the pns data collection. 15 moreover, with the inconsistency in definitions of intellectual disabilities, 16 the lack of common metrics and the variability in definitions and data collection methods, comparing results across different countries and over time becomes difficult. this prevents us from determining whether brazil is behind or ahead of other information on intellectual disabilities based on this study. additionally, we hypothesise that the high prevalence of people with intellectual disabilities above the age of 60 in our findings may be linked to the occurrence of stroke, as 20% of the studied population had experienced one. it is known that down syndrome, parkinson’s disease, stroke and traumatic brain injury together account for 10.0% (95% ci 6.0% to 16.5%) of the global dementia prevalence, with higher rates in men than in women, due to the greater prevalence of these conditions in men, though these differences are not statistically significant. 17 the age distribution also highlights the urgency of discussing the improvement of health services for people with intellectual disabilities and the new challenges emerging in the brazilian population as it ages. this emergency has been discussed in the country since 2014. 4 18 as people with intellectual disabilities age, new challenges related to mental health may arise, including increased vulnerability to age-related mental health issues and the need for appropriate support services. considering that 30% of the population in the são paulo metropolitan region suffers from mental health disorders, 19 with depressive and anxiety disorders being responsible for the fifth and sixth leading causes of years of life lost to disability, 20 the improvement of mental healthcare and better access for people with intellectual disabilities in the country is urgent. in this context, an important discussion arises about access to mental health services for people with intellectual disabilities in brazil. despite the rede de atenção psicossocial covering people with disabilities, similar to studies conducted in other countries, we observe access barriers, including limited resources, lack of specialised services and structural inequalities based on factors such as race, income and geographic location. 4 18 additionally, many healthcare professionals are not adequately trained to respond to the specific mental health needs of people with intellectual disabilities. this may result in underdiagnosis, undertreatment and a lack of understanding of the individual experiences of brazilian people with intellectual disabilities. moreover, caregivers and parents of people with intellectual disabilities often face a significant caregiving burden, which may further impair the mental health of these individuals. our study has some limitations, including the fact that the pns defines its target population as residents of private permanent households and does not capture individuals living in institutions such as hospitals and nursing homes. consequently, the proportion of people with intellectual disabilities presented in the pns refers only to those living in private households, excluding institutionalised populations. in addition, the finding that nearly 20% of individuals with intellectual disability reported a history of stroke is unusually high and may reflect the inclusion of adults with acquired cognitive impairments, rather than only those with lifelong intellectual disabilities. furthermore, because the pns identification item includes ‘mental functions’, some individuals classified as having intellectual disability may primarily present adult-onset mental health disorders or other cognitive conditions, rather than lifelong intellectual disability. taken together, these aspects suggest that the pns definition captures a heterogeneous group, which should be considered when interpreting these results. moreover, reliance on self-report may limit the inclusion of individuals with moderate or severe intellectual disabilities who cannot self-report, potentially leading to an underrepresentation of this subgroup and a relative over-representation of people with milder forms of intellectual disability. finally, even though we stratified analyses by age groups (0–59 and ≥60 years) to mitigate this bias, the overlap between lifelong and acquired conditions cannot be completely disentangled in the pns data, which should be acknowledged as an important limitation. conclusions our results are crucial for discussing the need for the improvement of evidence-based public policies and data-driven practices in healthcare to ensure that people with intellectual disabilities have equitable access to the mental healthcare they deserve, promoting their overall well-being and enabling them to live fulfilling lives. with these findings, we see the urgency of a holistic approach, including policies and practices that ensure accessible, high-quality and equitable mental healthcare for this vulnerable population. this includes increasing government resources and funding for specialised services, as well as improving professional training to equip healthcare providers with the skills and understanding needed to effectively support people with intellectual disabilities. additionally, addressing structural inequalities and providing support to caregivers are crucial steps in creating a more inclusive and supportive environment for people with intellectual disabilities and their families. failing to address these issues has significant and harmful consequences for the well-being and lives of people with intellectual disabilities and their families. data availability statement all data used in this study are publicly available from the 2019 brazilian national health survey (pns). microdata and

Introduction
estimates by the brazilian institute of geography and statistics (ibge), based on the 2022 continuous national household sample survey (pnad), indicate that there are 18.6 million people with disabilities in brazil, considering the population aged 2 years and older. according to the pesquisa nacional em saúde (2019), people with intellectual disabilities are distributed across various regions of the country, with a higher prevalence in areas with greater population density, such as the southeast and south. analysing the distribution of these individuals by region, they are most concentrated in são paulo in the southeast, pará in the north, bahia in the northeast, goiás in the midwest and rio grande do sul in the south (pns, 2019). 1 the development of policies promoting the health rights of people with disabilities in brazil has a history rooted in philanthropy and fragmented initiatives. over the past 50 years, different groups, such as the disability rights movement, experts, philanthropic institutions, international organisations and governments of diverse political ideologies, have advocated for and shaped these efforts. 2 despite advancements, a lack of adequate funding has hindered the brazilian national policy for comprehensive healthcare for people with disabilities. in addition, the network of care for people with disabilities, which operates within the brazilian unified health system (sus), also faces similar financial constraints. this underfunding contrasts with the country’s ambitious economic and social agendas, which strive for economic growth, poverty eradication and improved social and health indicators. 3 in brazil, mental health has become a well-established state public policy, implemented through a legal framework based on the redes de atenção psicossocial (raps) model. this model aims to expand access to and improve the quality of psychosocial care, encompassing services like núcleos de apoio à saúde da família, centros de atenção psicossocial, community centres and mental health beds in general hospitals. however, research has consistently shown that individuals with intellectual disabilities face significant barriers in accessing mental services. these barriers include a lack of professional training, limited accessibility to services and the dependency of many individuals with intellectual disabilities on others to navigate the care system. 4 population-based studies in high-income countries have consistently shown that individuals with intellectual disabilities are more vulnerable to mental health problems compared with the general population, with prevalence rates ranging from 12.8% in children to 23.4% in adults and 27.2% in older adults. 5 intellectual disability is a strong predictor of psychiatric conditions (or=7.1), 5 and prevalence estimates of mental illness in adults range between 14% and 41%, with disproportionately high rates of schizophrenia, phobic disorders and psychosis compared with the non-disabled population. 6 7 among children and adolescents, psychiatric disorders affect 30%–50%, with rates of 36% reported in the uk compared with only 8% among peers without intellectual disabilities. 5–7 moreover, anxiety, conduct disorders and hyperactivity are more frequent in this population. 8 9 in contrast, the scarcity of similar data in latin america highlights an urgent research gap, impeding the development of targeted policies and the removal of barriers to service delivery. 10 11 these health disparities demand public health attention, as the presence of multiple comorbidities further increases the risk of mental disorders and exacerbates health inequalities. 12 13 since access to healthcare is a key mechanism for identifying and addressing social inequalities, this manuscript aims to investigate the occurrence of depression and other mental health disorders associated with intellectual disability in brazil by analysing data from a national household survey 1 conducted in a middle-to-low-income country. methods design this is a cross-sectional epidemiological study based on secondary data from the national survey of health, 1 a population-based survey conducted in 2019 by the ibge in partnership with the ministry of health. the pns is part of the ibge’s integrated system of household surveys (sipd) and aims to obtain nationwide information on the health situation, lifestyles and healthcare of the adult brazilian population living in private households, in urban and rural areas, excluding special census tracts (barracks, military bases, lodgings, camps, boats, penitentiaries, penal colonies, prisons, jails, nursing homes, orphanages, convents and hospitals). the pns is a household-based survey with a three-stage cluster sampling plan, with stratification of the primary sampling units (upas (unidades primárias de amostragem)). census tracts are the primary sampling units; households are the secondary units and residents aged 15 and over are the tertiary units. households and residents were selected by simple random sampling. the sample was estimated at 108 525 households. information was collected from 94 114 households, with 90 846 residents aged 15 or over responding to the individual questionnaire, giving a final response rate of 96.5%. the interviews were conducted between august 2019 and march 2020. the information was collected by trained interviewers and recorded on mobile collection devices, smartphones, programmed with the survey questionnaire and the processes for analysing the variables. after explaining the study, the objectives and the importance of participating in the interview, a questionnaire was administered to the individual aged 15 or over selected in the household. the questionnaire included questions on sociodemographic characteristics, self-rated health, lifestyles, chronic diseases and oral health. weight and height measurements were also taken. if the person with intellectual disability could not directly participate in the interview, the information was obtained from proxy respondents, such as family members or close caregivers. these informants answered the same set of questions on behalf of the participant, without any modifications to the content or the mode of administration. this approach ensured comparability of responses and enabled the inclusion of participants who otherwise could not have been represented in the study. more detailed descriptions of the sampling process and data collection methods can be found in the pns 2019 report, available online on the ibge website. the data were accessed on 21 june 2023 ( https://www.pns.icict.fiocruz.br/bases-de-dados/ ). self-reported intellectual disabilities the following identifying variable is used to identify people with intellectual disabilities in the pns: ‘due to some limitation in mental or intellectual functions, does ___ have a permanent difficulty performing usual activities, such as communicating, performing personal care, working, attending school, playing, etc? (for residents aged 5 years or older)’ or ‘due to some limitation in mental or intellectual functions, does ___ have a permanent difficulty performing usual activities, such as attending school, playing, etc? (for residents aged 2 to 4 years).’ the pns considers people with intellectual disabilities to be those who ‘reported having great difficulty or being completely unable to perform usual activities, such as communicating, performing personal care, working, attending school, playing, etc, due to some limitation in mental/intellectual functions’. outcome: depression and mental health disorders other than depression self-report measures of depression in the pns were obtained through the following variable: ‘has a doctor or mental health professional (such as a psychiatrist or psychologist) ever given you a diagnosis of depression?’ (no/yes). self-report of mental health disorders other than depression (anxiety, panic, schizophrenia, bipolar, psychosis or ocd) was obtained by the variable: ‘has a doctor or health professional (such as a psychiatrist or psychologist) ever given you a diagnosis of another mental illness, such as anxiety disorder, panic disorder, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, psychosis or ocd (obsessive-compulsive disorder), etc?’ (no/yes) the outcome variable for mental health was constructed from the association between self-reported depression and self-reported mental health disorders other than depression and was categorised as: no mental health disorder/depression/mental health disorders other than depression/depression associated with other mental health disorders. characteristics of the individual, social environment and health the following variables were analysed: self-reported sociodemographic characteristics (sex (female/male); race (white/black/asian/brown/indigenous); age (0–18/19–59/>60); marital status (single/married/divorced/separated/widowed); education (illiterate/elementary/high school/college/postgraduate)). self-reported health characteristics (self-perceived health (very good/good/fair/poor/very bad); mental healthcare frequency (never visits/only when problems arise/regularly); reasons for not seeking mental health services (no longer depressed/too far/lack of motivation to seek help/long waiting times/general difficulty/incompatible schedule/cannot get an appointment via health plan/does not know whom to consult/other reason). the occurrence of stroke (no/yes) was assessed to control for potential confounding factors. statistical analysis descriptive analyses were conducted on the sociodemographic and health characteristics of brazilian individuals with intellectual disabilities. comparisons were performed using pearson’s χ² test with the rao-scott correction. 13 the description incorporated weights to adjust for different selection probabilities of the participants, and the results were expressed as weighted values. all p values <0.05 were considered statistically significant. the survey (svy) package in stata v.17 was used, providing procedures for analysing complex sample data. this software allowed the incorporation of different observation weights that could influence the parameter estimates for the total population, accounting for the effect of sampling on variance estimates. the pns does not differentiate intellectual disability present since birth. to minimise potential selection bias between individuals with intellectual disability present since birth and those with cognitive conditions acquired later in life (e.g., due to stroke or age-related conditions), we stratified the population into two age groups: 0–59 years and ≥60 years a multinomial logistic regression was used to analyse association between self-reported mental health disorders and intellectual disability. associations with a p<0.2 in the univariate analyses were included in the multinomial logistic regression using a forward selection approach. the strength of the associations was estimated through ors and their corresponding 95% cis. results of the 272 499 pns interviewees, only 1.2% (n=3198) had intellectual disabilities. the sample of people with intellectual disabilities was composed mainly of individuals aged 19–59 years, single, illiterate, without self-reported mental health disorders. despite this, they regularly attended mental health services. approximately 20% of the sample reported having suffered a stroke and 37.2% reported that their health status was regular ( table 1 ). view this table: view inline view popup table 1 sociodemographic and health characteristics of brazilian individuals with intellectual disabilities (n=272 499) nearly half of participants with intellectual disability (43.2%) had at least one mental health disorder diagnosis, compared with only 13.7% of those without intellectual disability ( table 1 ). table 2 presents the results of the associations between sociodemographic variables by age strata. women with intellectual disabilities showed higher prevalences of depression and depression associated with other mental health disorders compared with men, both among adults (0–59 years) and older adults (≥60 years). regarding marital status, single adults concentrated a higher proportion of diagnoses of depression and other mental health disorders, while among older adults, widowhood was associated with a higher burden of disorders and comorbidities. although no statistically significant differences were found by race/skin colour, brown and black individuals were more represented among the cases of mental health disorders. with respect to education, among younger adults, depression was more frequent in those with high school education, while illiteracy was associated with poorer self-perceived health and possible underdiagnosis. view this table: view inline view popup table 2 sociodemographic and health characteristics of individuals with intellectual disabilities among the health conditions assessed, no significant differences were observed in the occurrence of mental health disorders among adults who reported having had a stroke; however, among older adults, those with a history of stroke showed a higher prevalence of depression, suggesting an interaction between physical sequelae, functional dependence and increased risk of mental health disorders. regarding self-perceived health, a consistent association was found between poorer health perception and a higher prevalence of depression and other mental health disorders across all age groups, confirming this subjective indicator as a robust marker of vulnerability to mental health problems ( table 2 ). in the multinomial logistic regression analyses ( table 3 ), adults aged 0–59 years with intellectual disabilities had a 3.25-fold higher likelihood of depression (95% ci 1.76 to 6.00), a 12.23-fold higher likelihood of other mental health disorders (95% ci 7.52 to 19.90) and an extremely elevated adjusted or of 14.34 (95% ci 7.92 to 25.96) for the combination of depression and other disorders, indicating that intellectual disability is a strong predictor of psychiatric multimorbidity in younger adults. among older adults (≥60 years), intellectual disabilities remained significantly associated with mental health outcomes, with a 1.71-fold higher risk of depression (95% ci 1.04 to 2.79), a 4.33-fold higher risk of other disorders (95% ci 2.09 to 8.94) and a 2.98-fold higher risk of combined depression and other disorders (95% ci 1.49 to 5.95). view this table: view inline view popup table 3 estimates of crude and adjusted ors (aor) of mental health disorders according to intellectual disabilities, by age (n=3198)‡ discussion the prevalence of intellectual disability in brazil, as determined by our study, is 1.2%. the distribution of self-reported intellectual disabilities is notably higher within the age cohort under 59 years, a demographic where intellectual disability is less likely to be an acquired condition (eg, due to a stroke). this finding supports the representativeness of our sample and suggests that our study design successfully mitigated selection bias. among them, adults were notably more represented (46.0%), with about 20% having suffered a stroke. depressive disorders and comorbidities between depression and mental health disorders other than depression were more frequent among elderly brazilian women with intellectual disabilities, while mental health disorders other than depression were more common among men with intellectual disabilities. however, our findings highlight the high likelihood of mental health disorders occurring among brazilian people with intellectual disabilities, as well as the occurrence of comorbidities between depression and mental health disorders other than depression being approximately eight times higher when compared with the population without intellectual disabilities. the occurrence of mental health disorders among the brazilian population with intellectual disabilities is significantly higher than what has been found in other countries. a scoping review of 100 articles 14 found that the risk of developing mental disorders for people with intellectual disabilities is 3–4 times higher than the general population, despite frequent underdiagnosis and misdiagnoses, due to atypical symptom presentations, challenges in communication with patients and lack of adapted diagnostic tools. in our study, the chance of these outcomes occurring was 6–8 times higher. this could be attributed to the fact that the pns is a self-reported survey, meaning that self-declaration of intellectual disability may be either underestimated or overestimated, due to proxy responses or misunderstanding of the questions posed by interviewers. studies have shown that individuals with intellectual disabilities can provide reliable self-reports, but often require support, such as simplification of questions and the use of visual alternatives, which was not provided in the pns data collection. 15 moreover, with the inconsistency in definitions of intellectual disabilities, 16 the lack of common metrics and the variability in definitions and data collection methods, comparing results across different countries and over time becomes difficult. this prevents us from determining whether brazil is behind or ahead of other information on intellectual disabilities based on this study. additionally, we hypothesise that the high prevalence of people with intellectual disabilities above the age of 60 in our findings may be linked to the occurrence of stroke, as 20% of the studied population had experienced one. it is known that down syndrome, parkinson’s disease, stroke and traumatic brain injury together account for 10.0% (95% ci 6.0% to 16.5%) of the global dementia prevalence, with higher rates in men than in women, due to the greater prevalence of these conditions in men, though these differences are not statistically significant. 17 the age distribution also highlights the urgency of discussing the improvement of health services for people with intellectual disabilities and the new challenges emerging in the brazilian population as it ages. this emergency has been discussed in the country since 2014. 4 18 as people with intellectual disabilities age, new challenges related to mental health may arise, including increased vulnerability to age-related mental health issues and the need for appropriate support services. considering that 30% of the population in the são paulo metropolitan region suffers from mental health disorders, 19 with depressive and anxiety disorders being responsible for the fifth and sixth leading causes of years of life lost to disability, 20 the improvement of mental healthcare and better access for people with intellectual disabilities in the country is urgent. in this context, an important discussion arises about access to mental health services for people with intellectual disabilities in brazil. despite the rede de atenção psicossocial covering people with disabilities, similar to studies conducted in other countries, we observe access barriers, including limited resources, lack of specialised services and structural inequalities based on factors such as race, income and geographic location. 4 18 additionally, many healthcare professionals are not adequately trained to respond to the specific mental health needs of people with intellectual disabilities. this may result in underdiagnosis, undertreatment and a lack of understanding of the individual experiences of brazilian people with intellectual disabilities. moreover, caregivers and parents of people with intellectual disabilities often face a significant caregiving burden, which may further impair the mental health of these individuals. our study has some limitations, including the fact that the pns defines its target population as residents of private permanent households and does not capture individuals living in institutions such as hospitals and nursing homes. consequently, the proportion of people with intellectual disabilities presented in the pns refers only to those living in private households, excluding institutionalised populations. in addition, the finding that nearly 20% of individuals with intellectual disability reported a history of stroke is unusually high and may reflect the inclusion of adults with acquired cognitive impairments, rather than only those with lifelong intellectual disabilities. furthermore, because the pns identification item includes ‘mental functions’, some individuals classified as having intellectual disability may primarily present adult-onset mental health disorders or other cognitive conditions, rather than lifelong intellectual disability. taken together, these aspects suggest that the pns definition captures a heterogeneous group, which should be considered when interpreting these results. moreover, reliance on self-report may limit the inclusion of individuals with moderate or severe intellectual disabilities who cannot self-report, potentially leading to an underrepresentation of this subgroup and a relative over-representation of people with milder forms of intellectual disability. finally, even though we stratified analyses by age groups (0–59 and ≥60 years) to mitigate this bias, the overlap between lifelong and acquired conditions cannot be completely disentangled in the pns data, which should be acknowledged as an important limitation. conclusions our results are crucial for discussing the need for the improvement of evidence-based public policies and data-driven practices in healthcare to ensure that people with intellectual disabilities have equitable access to the mental healthcare they deserve, promoting their overall well-being and enabling them to live fulfilling lives. with these findings, we see the urgency of a holistic approach, including policies and practices that ensure accessible, high-quality and equitable mental healthcare for this vulnerable population. this includes increasing government resources and funding for specialised services, as well as improving professional training to equip healthcare providers with the skills and understanding needed to effectively support people with intellectual disabilities. additionally, addressing structural inequalities and providing support to caregivers are crucial steps in creating a more inclusive and supportive environment for people with intellectual disabilities and their families. failing to address these issues has significant and harmful consequences for the well-being and lives of people with intellectual disabilities and their families. data availability statement all data used in this study are publicly available from the 2019 brazilian national health survey (pns). microdata and

design this is a cross-sectional epidemiological study based on secondary data from the national survey of health, 1 a population-based survey conducted in 2019 by the ibge in partnership with the ministry of health. the pns is part of the ibge’s integrated system of household surveys (sipd) and aims to obtain nationwide information on the health situation, lifestyles and healthcare of the adult brazilian population living in private households, in urban and rural areas, excluding special census tracts (barracks, military bases, lodgings, camps, boats, penitentiaries, penal colonies, prisons, jails, nursing homes, orphanages, convents and hospitals). the pns is a household-based survey with a three-stage cluster sampling plan, with stratification of the primary sampling units (upas (unidades primárias de amostragem)). census tracts are the primary sampling units; households are the secondary units and residents aged 15 and over are the tertiary units. households and residents were selected by simple random sampling. the sample was estimated at 108 525 households. information was collected from 94 114 households, with 90 846 residents aged 15 or over responding to the individual questionnaire, giving a final response rate of 96.5%. the interviews were conducted between august 2019 and march 2020. the information was collected by trained interviewers and recorded on mobile collection devices, smartphones, programmed with the survey questionnaire and the processes for analysing the variables. after explaining the study, the objectives and the importance of participating in the interview, a questionnaire was administered to the individual aged 15 or over selected in the household. the questionnaire included questions on sociodemographic characteristics, self-rated health, lifestyles, chronic diseases and oral health. weight and height measurements were also taken. if the person with intellectual disability could not directly participate in the interview, the information was obtained from proxy respondents, such as family members or close caregivers. these informants answered the same set of questions on behalf of the participant, without any modifications to the content or the mode of administration. this approach ensured comparability of responses and enabled the inclusion of participants who otherwise could not have been represented in the study. more detailed descriptions of the sampling process and data collection methods can be found in the pns 2019 report, available online on the ibge website. the data were accessed on 21 june 2023 ( https://www.pns.icict.fiocruz.br/bases-de-dados/ ). self-reported intellectual disabilities the following identifying variable is used to identify people with intellectual disabilities in the pns: ‘due to some limitation in mental or intellectual functions, does ___ have a permanent difficulty performing usual activities, such as communicating, performing personal care, working, attending school, playing, etc? (for residents aged 5 years or older)’ or ‘due to some limitation in mental or intellectual functions, does ___ have a permanent difficulty performing usual activities, such as attending school, playing, etc? (for residents aged 2 to 4 years).’ the pns considers people with intellectual disabilities to be those who ‘reported having great difficulty or being completely unable to perform usual activities, such as communicating, performing personal care, working, attending school, playing, etc, due to some limitation in mental/intellectual functions’. outcome: depression and mental health disorders other than depression self-report measures of depression in the pns were obtained through the following variable: ‘has a doctor or mental health professional (such as a psychiatrist or psychologist) ever given you a diagnosis of depression?’ (no/yes). self-report of mental health disorders other than depression (anxiety, panic, schizophrenia, bipolar, psychosis or ocd) was obtained by the variable: ‘has a doctor or health professional (such as a psychiatrist or psychologist) ever given you a diagnosis of another mental illness, such as anxiety disorder, panic disorder, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, psychosis or ocd (obsessive-compulsive disorder), etc?’ (no/yes) the outcome variable for mental health was constructed from the association between self-reported depression and self-reported mental health disorders other than depression and was categorised as: no mental health disorder/depression/mental health disorders other than depression/depression associated with other mental health disorders. characteristics of the individual, social environment and health the following variables were analysed: self-reported sociodemographic characteristics (sex (female/male); race (white/black/asian/brown/indigenous); age (0–18/19–59/>60); marital status (single/married/divorced/separated/widowed); education (illiterate/elementary/high school/college/postgraduate)). self-reported health characteristics (self-perceived health (very good/good/fair/poor/very bad); mental healthcare frequency (never visits/only when problems arise/regularly); reasons for not seeking mental health services (no longer depressed/too far/lack of motivation to seek help/long waiting times/general difficulty/incompatible schedule/cannot get an appointment via health plan/does not know whom to consult/other reason). the occurrence of stroke (no/yes) was assessed to control for potential confounding factors. statistical analysis descriptive analyses were conducted on the sociodemographic and health characteristics of brazilian individuals with intellectual disabilities. comparisons were performed using pearson’s χ² test with the rao-scott correction. 13 the description incorporated weights to adjust for different selection probabilities of the participants, and the results were expressed as weighted values. all p values <0.05 were considered statistically significant. the survey (svy) package in stata v.17 was used, providing procedures for analysing complex sample data. this software allowed the incorporation of different observation weights that could influence the parameter estimates for the total population, accounting for the effect of sampling on variance estimates. the pns does not differentiate intellectual disability present since birth. to minimise potential selection bias between individuals with intellectual disability present since birth and those with cognitive conditions acquired later in life (e.g., due to stroke or age-related conditions), we stratified the population into two age groups: 0–59 years and ≥60 years a multinomial logistic regression was used to analyse association between self-reported mental health disorders and intellectual disability. associations with a p<0.2 in the univariate analyses were included in the multinomial logistic regression using a forward selection approach. the strength of the associations was estimated through ors and their corresponding 95% cis. results of the 272 499 pns interviewees, only 1.2% (n=3198) had intellectual disabilities. the sample of people with intellectual disabilities was composed mainly of individuals aged 19–59 years, single, illiterate, without self-reported mental health disorders. despite this, they regularly attended mental health services. approximately 20% of the sample reported having suffered a stroke and 37.2% reported that their health status was regular ( table 1 ). view this table: view inline view popup table 1 sociodemographic and health characteristics of brazilian individuals with intellectual disabilities (n=272 499) nearly half of participants with intellectual disability (43.2%) had at least one mental health disorder diagnosis, compared with only 13.7% of those without intellectual disability ( table 1 ). table 2 presents the results of the associations between sociodemographic variables by age strata. women with intellectual disabilities showed higher prevalences of depression and depression associated with other mental health disorders compared with men, both among adults (0–59 years) and older adults (≥60 years). regarding marital status, single adults concentrated a higher proportion of diagnoses of depression and other mental health disorders, while among older adults, widowhood was associated with a higher burden of disorders and comorbidities. although no statistically significant differences were found by race/skin colour, brown and black individuals were more represented among the cases of mental health disorders. with respect to education, among younger adults, depression was more frequent in those with high school education, while illiteracy was associated with poorer self-perceived health and possible underdiagnosis. view this table: view inline view popup table 2 sociodemographic and health characteristics of individuals with intellectual disabilities among the health conditions assessed, no significant differences were observed in the occurrence of mental health disorders among adults who reported having had a stroke; however, among older adults, those with a history of stroke showed a higher prevalence of depression, suggesting an interaction between physical sequelae, functional dependence and increased risk of mental health disorders. regarding self-perceived health, a consistent association was found between poorer health perception and a higher prevalence of depression and other mental health disorders across all age groups, confirming this subjective indicator as a robust marker of vulnerability to mental health problems ( table 2 ). in the multinomial logistic regression analyses ( table 3 ), adults aged 0–59 years with intellectual disabilities had a 3.25-fold higher likelihood of depression (95% ci 1.76 to 6.00), a 12.23-fold higher likelihood of other mental health disorders (95% ci 7.52 to 19.90) and an extremely elevated adjusted or of 14.34 (95% ci 7.92 to 25.96) for the combination of depression and other disorders, indicating that intellectual disability is a strong predictor of psychiatric multimorbidity in younger adults. among older adults (≥60 years), intellectual disabilities remained significantly associated with mental health outcomes, with a 1.71-fold higher risk of depression (95% ci 1.04 to 2.79), a 4.33-fold higher risk of other disorders (95% ci 2.09 to 8.94) and a 2.98-fold higher risk of combined depression and other disorders (95% ci 1.49 to 5.95). view this table: view inline view popup table 3 estimates of crude and adjusted ors (aor) of mental health disorders according to intellectual disabilities, by age (n=3198)‡ discussion the prevalence of intellectual disability in brazil, as determined by our study, is 1.2%. the distribution of self-reported intellectual disabilities is notably higher within the age cohort under 59 years, a demographic where intellectual disability is less likely to be an acquired condition (eg, due to a stroke). this finding supports the representativeness of our sample and suggests that our study design successfully mitigated selection bias. among them, adults were notably more represented (46.0%), with about 20% having suffered a stroke. depressive disorders and comorbidities between depression and mental health disorders other than depression were more frequent among elderly brazilian women with intellectual disabilities, while mental health disorders other than depression were more common among men with intellectual disabilities. however, our findings highlight the high likelihood of mental health disorders occurring among brazilian people with intellectual disabilities, as well as the occurrence of comorbidities between depression and mental health disorders other than depression being approximately eight times higher when compared with the population without intellectual disabilities. the occurrence of mental health disorders among the brazilian population with intellectual disabilities is significantly higher than what has been found in other countries. a scoping review of 100 articles 14 found that the risk of developing mental disorders for people with intellectual disabilities is 3–4 times higher than the general population, despite frequent underdiagnosis and misdiagnoses, due to atypical symptom presentations, challenges in communication with patients and lack of adapted diagnostic tools. in our study, the chance of these outcomes occurring was 6–8 times higher. this could be attributed to the fact that the pns is a self-reported survey, meaning that self-declaration of intellectual disability may be either underestimated or overestimated, due to proxy responses or misunderstanding of the questions posed by interviewers. studies have shown that individuals with intellectual disabilities can provide reliable self-reports, but often require support, such as simplification of questions and the use of visual alternatives, which was not provided in the pns data collection. 15 moreover, with the inconsistency in definitions of intellectual disabilities, 16 the lack of common metrics and the variability in definitions and data collection methods, comparing results across different countries and over time becomes difficult. this prevents us from determining whether brazil is behind or ahead of other information on intellectual disabilities based on this study. additionally, we hypothesise that the high prevalence of people with intellectual disabilities above the age of 60 in our findings may be linked to the occurrence of stroke, as 20% of the studied population had experienced one. it is known that down syndrome, parkinson’s disease, stroke and traumatic brain injury together account for 10.0% (95% ci 6.0% to 16.5%) of the global dementia prevalence, with higher rates in men than in women, due to the greater prevalence of these conditions in men, though these differences are not statistically significant. 17 the age distribution also highlights the urgency of discussing the improvement of health services for people with intellectual disabilities and the new challenges emerging in the brazilian population as it ages. this emergency has been discussed in the country since 2014. 4 18 as people with intellectual disabilities age, new challenges related to mental health may arise, including increased vulnerability to age-related mental health issues and the need for appropriate support services. considering that 30% of the population in the são paulo metropolitan region suffers from mental health disorders, 19 with depressive and anxiety disorders being responsible for the fifth and sixth leading causes of years of life lost to disability, 20 the improvement of mental healthcare and better access for people with intellectual disabilities in the country is urgent. in this context, an important discussion arises about access to mental health services for people with intellectual disabilities in brazil. despite the rede de atenção psicossocial covering people with disabilities, similar to studies conducted in other countries, we observe access barriers, including limited resources, lack of specialised services and structural inequalities based on factors such as race, income and geographic location. 4 18 additionally, many healthcare professionals are not adequately trained to respond to the specific mental health needs of people with intellectual disabilities. this may result in underdiagnosis, undertreatment and a lack of understanding of the individual experiences of brazilian people with intellectual disabilities. moreover, caregivers and parents of people with intellectual disabilities often face a significant caregiving burden, which may further impair the mental health of these individuals. our study has some limitations, including the fact that the pns defines its target population as residents of private permanent households and does not capture individuals living in institutions such as hospitals and nursing homes. consequently, the proportion of people with intellectual disabilities presented in the pns refers only to those living in private households, excluding institutionalised populations. in addition, the finding that nearly 20% of individuals with intellectual disability reported a history of stroke is unusually high and may reflect the inclusion of adults with acquired cognitive impairments, rather than only those with lifelong intellectual disabilities. furthermore, because the pns identification item includes ‘mental functions’, some individuals classified as having intellectual disability may primarily present adult-onset mental health disorders or other cognitive conditions, rather than lifelong intellectual disability. taken together, these aspects suggest that the pns definition captures a heterogeneous group, which should be considered when interpreting these results. moreover, reliance on self-report may limit the inclusion of individuals with moderate or severe intellectual disabilities who cannot self-report, potentially leading to an underrepresentation of this subgroup and a relative over-representation of people with milder forms of intellectual disability. finally, even though we stratified analyses by age groups (0–59 and ≥60 years) to mitigate this bias, the overlap between lifelong and acquired conditions cannot be completely disentangled in the pns data, which should be acknowledged as an important limitation. conclusions our results are crucial for discussing the need for the improvement of evidence-based public policies and data-driven practices in healthcare to ensure that people with intellectual disabilities have equitable access to the mental healthcare they deserve, promoting their overall well-being and enabling them to live fulfilling lives. with these findings, we see the urgency of a holistic approach, including policies and practices that ensure accessible, high-quality and equitable mental healthcare for this vulnerable population. this includes increasing government resources and funding for specialised services, as well as improving professional training to equip healthcare providers with the skills and understanding needed to effectively support people with intellectual disabilities. additionally, addressing structural inequalities and providing support to caregivers are crucial steps in creating a more inclusive and supportive environment for people with intellectual disabilities and their families. failing to address these issues has significant and harmful consequences for the well-being and lives of people with intellectual disabilities and their families. data availability statement all data used in this study are publicly available from the 2019 brazilian national health survey (pns). microdata and

Results
among people with intellectual disabilities, 43.2% reported at least one mental health disorder versus 13.7% without disabilities. in adults aged 0–59 years, intellectual disability was associated with higher odds of depression (adjusted or (aor) 3.25, 95% ci 1.76 to 6.00), mental health disorders other than depression (aor 12.23, 95% ci 7.52 to 19.90) and depression associated with other mental health disorders (aor 14.34, 95% ci 7.92 to 25.96). in older adults (≥60 years), risks also remained elevated: depression (aor 1.71, 95% ci 1.04 to 2.79), mental health disorders other than depression (aor 4.33, 95% ci 2.09 to 8.94) and depression associated with other mental health disorders (aor 2.98, 95% ci 1.49 to 5.95). women with intellectual disabilities were more likely to report depression and multimorbidity, while men more often reported non-depressive disorders. poorer self-perceived health was consistently linked to worse outcomes across age groups. conclusions mental health disorders and their comorbidities are significantly more prevalent among people with intellectual disabilities in brazil. these findings highlight the urgent need for inclusive, equitable and specialised mental healthcare policies. mental health health equity cross-sectional studies disabled persons data availability statement all data used in this study are publicly available from the

standardised diagnostic tools may lead to underestimation or overestimation of prevalence. cross-sectional design prevents causal inference. introduction estimates by the brazilian institute of geography and statistics (ibge), based on the 2022 continuous national household sample survey (pnad), indicate that there are 18.6 million people with disabilities in brazil, considering the population aged 2 years and older. according to the pesquisa nacional em saúde (2019), people with intellectual disabilities are distributed across various regions of the country, with a higher prevalence in areas with greater population density, such as the southeast and south. analysing the distribution of these individuals by region, they are most concentrated in são paulo in the southeast, pará in the north, bahia in the northeast, goiás in the midwest and rio grande do sul in the south (pns, 2019). 1 the development of policies promoting the health rights of people with disabilities in brazil has a history rooted in philanthropy and fragmented initiatives. over the past 50 years, different groups, such as the disability rights movement, experts, philanthropic institutions, international organisations and governments of diverse political ideologies, have advocated for and shaped these efforts. 2 despite advancements, a lack of adequate funding has hindered the brazilian national policy for comprehensive healthcare for people with disabilities. in addition, the network of care for people with disabilities, which operates within the brazilian unified health system (sus), also faces similar financial constraints. this underfunding contrasts with the country’s ambitious economic and social agendas, which strive for economic growth, poverty eradication and improved social and health indicators. 3 in brazil, mental health has become a well-established state public policy, implemented through a legal framework based on the redes de atenção psicossocial (raps) model. this model aims to expand access to and improve the quality of psychosocial care, encompassing services like núcleos de apoio à saúde da família, centros de atenção psicossocial, community centres and mental health beds in general hospitals. however, research has consistently shown that individuals with intellectual disabilities face significant barriers in accessing mental services. these barriers include a lack of professional training, limited accessibility to services and the dependency of many individuals with intellectual disabilities on others to navigate the care system. 4 population-based studies in high-income countries have consistently shown that individuals with intellectual disabilities are more vulnerable to mental health problems compared with the general population, with prevalence rates ranging from 12.8% in children to 23.4% in adults and 27.2% in older adults. 5 intellectual disability is a strong predictor of psychiatric conditions (or=7.1), 5 and prevalence estimates of mental illness in adults range between 14% and 41%, with disproportionately high rates of schizophrenia, phobic disorders and psychosis compared with the non-disabled population. 6 7 among children and adolescents, psychiatric disorders affect 30%–50%, with rates of 36% reported in the uk compared with only 8% among peers without intellectual disabilities. 5–7 moreover, anxiety, conduct disorders and hyperactivity are more frequent in this population. 8 9 in contrast, the scarcity of similar data in latin america highlights an urgent research gap, impeding the development of targeted policies and the removal of barriers to service delivery. 10 11 these health disparities demand public health attention, as the presence of multiple comorbidities further increases the risk of mental disorders and exacerbates health inequalities. 12 13 since access to healthcare is a key mechanism for identifying and addressing social inequalities, this manuscript aims to investigate the occurrence of depression and other mental health disorders associated with intellectual disability in brazil by analysing data from a national household survey 1 conducted in a middle-to-low-income country. methods design this is a cross-sectional epidemiological study based on secondary data from the national survey of health, 1 a population-based survey conducted in 2019 by the ibge in partnership with the ministry of health. the pns is part of the ibge’s integrated system of household surveys (sipd) and aims to obtain nationwide information on the health situation, lifestyles and healthcare of the adult brazilian population living in private households, in urban and rural areas, excluding special census tracts (barracks, military bases, lodgings, camps, boats, penitentiaries, penal colonies, prisons, jails, nursing homes, orphanages, convents and hospitals). the pns is a household-based survey with a three-stage cluster sampling plan, with stratification of the primary sampling units (upas (unidades primárias de amostragem)). census tracts are the primary sampling units; households are the secondary units and residents aged 15 and over are the tertiary units. households and residents were selected by simple random sampling. the sample was estimated at 108 525 households. information was collected from 94 114 households, with 90 846 residents aged 15 or over responding to the individual questionnaire, giving a final response rate of 96.5%. the interviews were conducted between august 2019 and march 2020. the information was collected by trained interviewers and recorded on mobile collection devices, smartphones, programmed with the survey questionnaire and the processes for analysing the variables. after explaining the study, the objectives and the importance of participating in the interview, a questionnaire was administered to the individual aged 15 or over selected in the household. the questionnaire included questions on sociodemographic characteristics, self-rated health, lifestyles, chronic diseases and oral health. weight and height measurements were also taken. if the person with intellectual disability could not directly participate in the interview, the information was obtained from proxy respondents, such as family members or close caregivers. these informants answered the same set of questions on behalf of the participant, without any modifications to the content or the mode of administration. this approach ensured comparability of responses and enabled the inclusion of participants who otherwise could not have been represented in the study. more detailed descriptions of the sampling process and data collection methods can be found in the pns 2019 report, available online on the ibge website. the data were accessed on 21 june 2023 ( https://www.pns.icict.fiocruz.br/bases-de-dados/ ). self-reported intellectual disabilities the following identifying variable is used to identify people with intellectual disabilities in the pns: ‘due to some limitation in mental or intellectual functions, does ___ have a permanent difficulty performing usual activities, such as communicating, performing personal care, working, attending school, playing, etc? (for residents aged 5 years or older)’ or ‘due to some limitation in mental or intellectual functions, does ___ have a permanent difficulty performing usual activities, such as attending school, playing, etc? (for residents aged 2 to 4 years).’ the pns considers people with intellectual disabilities to be those who ‘reported having great difficulty or being completely unable to perform usual activities, such as communicating, performing personal care, working, attending school, playing, etc, due to some limitation in mental/intellectual functions’. outcome: depression and mental health disorders other than depression self-report measures of depression in the pns were obtained through the following variable: ‘has a doctor or mental health professional (such as a psychiatrist or psychologist) ever given you a diagnosis of depression?’ (no/yes). self-report of mental health disorders other than depression (anxiety, panic, schizophrenia, bipolar, psychosis or ocd) was obtained by the variable: ‘has a doctor or health professional (such as a psychiatrist or psychologist) ever given you a diagnosis of another mental illness, such as anxiety disorder, panic disorder, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, psychosis or ocd (obsessive-compulsive disorder), etc?’ (no/yes) the outcome variable for mental health was constructed from the association between self-reported depression and self-reported mental health disorders other than depression and was categorised as: no mental health disorder/depression/mental health disorders other than depression/depression associated with other mental health disorders. characteristics of the individual, social environment and health the following variables were analysed: self-reported sociodemographic characteristics (sex (female/male); race (white/black/asian/brown/indigenous); age (0–18/19–59/>60); marital status (single/married/divorced/separated/widowed); education (illiterate/elementary/high school/college/postgraduate)). self-reported health characteristics (self-perceived health (very good/good/fair/poor/very bad); mental healthcare frequency (never visits/only when problems arise/regularly); reasons for not seeking mental health services (no longer depressed/too far/lack of motivation to seek help/long waiting times/general difficulty/incompatible schedule/cannot get an appointment via health plan/does not know whom to consult/other reason). the occurrence of stroke (no/yes) was assessed to control for potential confounding factors. statistical analysis descriptive analyses were conducted on the sociodemographic and health characteristics of brazilian individuals with intellectual disabilities. comparisons were performed using pearson’s χ² test with the rao-scott correction. 13 the description incorporated weights to adjust for different selection probabilities of the participants, and the results were expressed as weighted values. all p values <0.05 were considered statistically significant. the survey (svy) package in stata v.17 was used, providing procedures for analysing complex sample data. this software allowed the incorporation of different observation weights that could influence the parameter estimates for the total population, accounting for the effect of sampling on variance estimates. the pns does not differentiate intellectual disability present since birth. to minimise potential selection bias between individuals with intellectual disability present since birth and those with cognitive conditions acquired later in life (e.g., due to stroke or age-related conditions), we stratified the population into two age groups: 0–59 years and ≥60 years a multinomial logistic regression was used to analyse association between self-reported mental health disorders and intellectual disability. associations with a p<0.2 in the univariate analyses were included in the multinomial logistic regression using a forward selection approach. the strength of the associations was estimated through ors and their corresponding 95% cis. results of the 272 499 pns interviewees, only 1.2% (n=3198) had intellectual disabilities. the sample of people with intellectual disabilities was composed mainly of individuals aged 19–59 years, single, illiterate, without self-reported mental health disorders. despite this, they regularly attended mental health services. approximately 20% of the sample reported having suffered a stroke and 37.2% reported that their health status was regular ( table 1 ). view this table: view inline view popup table 1 sociodemographic and health characteristics of brazilian individuals with intellectual disabilities (n=272 499) nearly half of participants with intellectual disability (43.2%) had at least one mental health disorder diagnosis, compared with only 13.7% of those without intellectual disability ( table 1 ). table 2 presents the results of the associations between sociodemographic variables by age strata. women with intellectual disabilities showed higher prevalences of depression and depression associated with other mental health disorders compared with men, both among adults (0–59 years) and older adults (≥60 years). regarding marital status, single adults concentrated a higher proportion of diagnoses of depression and other mental health disorders, while among older adults, widowhood was associated with a higher burden of disorders and comorbidities. although no statistically significant differences were found by race/skin colour, brown and black individuals were more represented among the cases of mental health disorders. with respect to education, among younger adults, depression was more frequent in those with high school education, while illiteracy was associated with poorer self-perceived health and possible underdiagnosis. view this table: view inline view popup table 2 sociodemographic and health characteristics of individuals with intellectual disabilities among the health conditions assessed, no significant differences were observed in the occurrence of mental health disorders among adults who reported having had a stroke; however, among older adults, those with a history of stroke showed a higher prevalence of depression, suggesting an interaction between physical sequelae, functional dependence and increased risk of mental health disorders. regarding self-perceived health, a consistent association was found between poorer health perception and a higher prevalence of depression and other mental health disorders across all age groups, confirming this subjective indicator as a robust marker of vulnerability to mental health problems ( table 2 ). in the multinomial logistic regression analyses ( table 3 ), adults aged 0–59 years with intellectual disabilities had a 3.25-fold higher likelihood of depression (95% ci 1.76 to 6.00), a 12.23-fold higher likelihood of other mental health disorders (95% ci 7.52 to 19.90) and an extremely elevated adjusted or of 14.34 (95% ci 7.92 to 25.96) for the combination of depression and other disorders, indicating that intellectual disability is a strong predictor of psychiatric multimorbidity in younger adults. among older adults (≥60 years), intellectual disabilities remained significantly associated with mental health outcomes, with a 1.71-fold higher risk of depression (95% ci 1.04 to 2.79), a 4.33-fold higher risk of other disorders (95% ci 2.09 to 8.94) and a 2.98-fold higher risk of combined depression and other disorders (95% ci 1.49 to 5.95). view this table: view inline view popup table 3 estimates of crude and adjusted ors (aor) of mental health disorders according to intellectual disabilities, by age (n=3198)‡ discussion the prevalence of intellectual disability in brazil, as determined by our study, is 1.2%. the distribution of self-reported intellectual disabilities is notably higher within the age cohort under 59 years, a demographic where intellectual disability is less likely to be an acquired condition (eg, due to a stroke). this finding supports the representativeness of our sample and suggests that our study design successfully mitigated selection bias. among them, adults were notably more represented (46.0%), with about 20% having suffered a stroke. depressive disorders and comorbidities between depression and mental health disorders other than depression were more frequent among elderly brazilian women with intellectual disabilities, while mental health disorders other than depression were more common among men with intellectual disabilities. however, our findings highlight the high likelihood of mental health disorders occurring among brazilian people with intellectual disabilities, as well as the occurrence of comorbidities between depression and mental health disorders other than depression being approximately eight times higher when compared with the population without intellectual disabilities. the occurrence of mental health disorders among the brazilian population with intellectual disabilities is significantly higher than what has been found in other countries. a scoping review of 100 articles 14 found that the risk of developing mental disorders for people with intellectual disabilities is 3–4 times higher than the general population, despite frequent underdiagnosis and misdiagnoses, due to atypical symptom presentations, challenges in communication with patients and lack of adapted diagnostic tools. in our study, the chance of these outcomes occurring was 6–8 times higher. this could be attributed to the fact that the pns is a self-reported survey, meaning that self-declaration of intellectual disability may be either underestimated or overestimated, due to proxy responses or misunderstanding of the questions posed by interviewers. studies have shown that individuals with intellectual disabilities can provide reliable self-reports, but often require support, such as simplification of questions and the use of visual alternatives, which was not provided in the pns data collection. 15 moreover, with the inconsistency in definitions of intellectual disabilities, 16 the lack of common metrics and the variability in definitions and data collection methods, comparing results across different countries and over time becomes difficult. this prevents us from determining whether brazil is behind or ahead of other information on intellectual disabilities based on this study. additionally, we hypothesise that the high prevalence of people with intellectual disabilities above the age of 60 in our findings may be linked to the occurrence of stroke, as 20% of the studied population had experienced one. it is known that down syndrome, parkinson’s disease, stroke and traumatic brain injury together account for 10.0% (95% ci 6.0% to 16.5%) of the global dementia prevalence, with higher rates in men than in women, due to the greater prevalence of these conditions in men, though these differences are not statistically significant. 17 the age distribution also highlights the urgency of discussing the improvement of health services for people with intellectual disabilities and the new challenges emerging in the brazilian population as it ages. this emergency has been discussed in the country since 2014. 4 18 as people with intellectual disabilities age, new challenges related to mental health may arise, including increased vulnerability to age-related mental health issues and the need for appropriate support services. considering that 30% of the population in the são paulo metropolitan region suffers from mental health disorders, 19 with depressive and anxiety disorders being responsible for the fifth and sixth leading causes of years of life lost to disability, 20 the improvement of mental healthcare and better access for people with intellectual disabilities in the country is urgent. in this context, an important discussion arises about access to mental health services for people with intellectual disabilities in brazil. despite the rede de atenção psicossocial covering people with disabilities, similar to studies conducted in other countries, we observe access barriers, including limited resources, lack of specialised services and structural inequalities based on factors such as race, income and geographic location. 4 18 additionally, many healthcare professionals are not adequately trained to respond to the specific mental health needs of people with intellectual disabilities. this may result in underdiagnosis, undertreatment and a lack of understanding of the individual experiences of brazilian people with intellectual disabilities. moreover, caregivers and parents of people with intellectual disabilities often face a significant caregiving burden, which may further impair the mental health of these individuals. our study has some limitations, including the fact that the pns defines its target population as residents of private permanent households and does not capture individuals living in institutions such as hospitals and nursing homes. consequently, the proportion of people with intellectual disabilities presented in the pns refers only to those living in private households, excluding institutionalised populations. in addition, the finding that nearly 20% of individuals with intellectual disability reported a history of stroke is unusually high and may reflect the inclusion of adults with acquired cognitive impairments, rather than only those with lifelong intellectual disabilities. furthermore, because the pns identification item includes ‘mental functions’, some individuals classified as having intellectual disability may primarily present adult-onset mental health disorders or other cognitive conditions, rather than lifelong intellectual disability. taken together, these aspects suggest that the pns definition captures a heterogeneous group, which should be considered when interpreting these results. moreover, reliance on self-report may limit the inclusion of individuals with moderate or severe intellectual disabilities who cannot self-report, potentially leading to an underrepresentation of this subgroup and a relative over-representation of people with milder forms of intellectual disability. finally, even though we stratified analyses by age groups (0–59 and ≥60 years) to mitigate this bias, the overlap between lifelong and acquired conditions cannot be completely disentangled in the pns data, which should be acknowledged as an important limitation. conclusions our results are crucial for discussing the need for the improvement of evidence-based public policies and data-driven practices in healthcare to ensure that people with intellectual disabilities have equitable access to the mental healthcare they deserve, promoting their overall well-being and enabling them to live fulfilling lives. with these findings, we see the urgency of a holistic approach, including policies and practices that ensure accessible, high-quality and equitable mental healthcare for this vulnerable population. this includes increasing government resources and funding for specialised services, as well as improving professional training to equip healthcare providers with the skills and understanding needed to effectively support people with intellectual disabilities. additionally, addressing structural inequalities and providing support to caregivers are crucial steps in creating a more inclusive and supportive environment for people with intellectual disabilities and their families. failing to address these issues has significant and harmful consequences for the well-being and lives of people with intellectual disabilities and their families. data availability statement all data used in this study are publicly available from the 2019 brazilian national health survey (pns). microdata and
