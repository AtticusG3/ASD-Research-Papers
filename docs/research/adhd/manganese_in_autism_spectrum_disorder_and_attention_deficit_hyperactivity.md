## Abstract

The objective of the present narrative review was to synthesize existing clinical and epidemiological findings linking manganese (Mn) exposure biomarkers to autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and to discuss key pathophysiological mechanisms of neurodevelopmental disorders that may be affected by this metal. Existing epidemiological data demonstrated both direct and inverse association between Mn body burden and ASD, or lack of any relationship. In contrast, the majority of studies revealed significantly higher Mn levels in subjects with ADHD, as well as direct relationship between Mn body burden with hyperactivity and inattention scores in children, although several studies reported contradictory results. Existing laboratory studies demonstrated that impaired attention and hyperactivity in animals following Mn exposure was associated with dopaminergic dysfunction and neuroinflammation. Despite lack of direct evidence on Mn-induced neurobiological alterations in patients with ASD and ADHD, a plethora of studies demonstrated that neurotoxic effects of Mn overexposure may interfere with key mechanisms of pathogenesis inherent to these neurodevelopmental disorders. Specifically, Mn overload was shown to impair not only dopaminergic neurotransmission, but also affect metabolism of glutamine/glutamate, GABA, serotonin, noradrenaline, thus affecting neuronal signaling. In turn, neurotoxic effects of Mn may be associated with its ability to induce oxidative stress, apoptosis, and neuroinflammation, and/or impair neurogenesis. Nonetheless, additional detailed studies are required to evaluate the association between environmental Mn exposure and/or Mn body burden and neurodevelopmental disorders at a wide range of concentrations to estimate the potential dose-dependent effects, as well as environmental and genetic factors affecting this association.
