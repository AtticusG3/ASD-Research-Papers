## Abstract

To study the effectiveness and safety of clobazam (CLB) as add-on therapy after the failure of initial antiseizure medicine (ASM) monotherapy in children (<18 years) with epilepsy, as part of a subanalysis of the ADD-ON study.
This was a subset analysis of the ADD-ON study (a prospective, multicentre, real-world, observational study of adding clobazam after the failure of first monotherapy) in children <18 years, conducted at 28 neurology outpatient clinics in India. Data pertaining to children with epilepsy aged <18 years in the ADD-ON study were evaluated. Seizure freedom rates at 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after starting CLB were analyzed. Seizure diaries and personal interviews were used to assess seizure control and side effects.
Of the 475 eligible participants from the ADD-ON study, 107 (22.5%) children were included. The median age was 13.0 (range, 3-17) years and 62.6% were boys. The median epilepsy duration was 2.0 years (range, 0.1-16). Majority of the children (n=43, 40.2%) had tonic-clonic seizures. The major reason for adding CLB to the existing therapy was inadequate control of seizures with current treatment (n=105, 98.1%). Of the 107 children, 92 completed one year of follow-up and were receiving CLB (retention rate: 85.9%) and at one-year, 74 (69.2%) children were seizure-free. Seizure freedom rates were similar for all seizure types. No major adverse effects related to clobazam were recorded during the study period.
