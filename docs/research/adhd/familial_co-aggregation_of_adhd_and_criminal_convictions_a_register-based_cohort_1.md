## Abstract

The association between ADHD and criminality is well established, yet little is known about the familial liability of ADHD and crime across different types of relatives, from twins to cousins. This study aims to clarify the association between ADHD and crime by examining their co-aggregation both in the general population and across a range of familial relationships in a nationwide population-based sample, including separate analyses for men and women.
We analyzed data from 1,507,211 individuals born in Sweden between 1987 and 2002. Using Cox proportional hazard regressions, we estimated the associations between clinically diagnosed ADHD and official crime records within individuals and families.
Analyses showed that individuals with ADHD had a significantly higher risk of being convicted of any crime-violent or non-violent-compared to those without ADHD, with the risk being significantly higher for women than men. Additionally, individuals with a relative diagnosed with ADHD were at increased risk of criminal convictions, with some gender-based variations.
