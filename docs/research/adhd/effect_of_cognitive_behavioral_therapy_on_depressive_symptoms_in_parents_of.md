objective this study conducts a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (rcts) that evaluate the effects of cognitive behavioral therapy (cbt) on depressive symptoms in parents of children with special needs. additionally, it examines potential moderators of treatment outcomes, including the type of child diagnosis and the dosage of intervention. methods a comprehensive literature search was performed in pubmed, web of science, scopus, psycinfo, and the cochrane library up to april 15, 2025. peer-reviewed rcts published in english that compared at least one structured cbt intervention to an inactive or active control group were included. hedges’ g was utilized to calculate standardized mean differences (smds) in depression scores. random- or fixed-effects models were employed based on heterogeneity (i 2 ). subgroup analyses and meta-regression were conducted to identify moderators. the risk of bias was assessed using the cochrane rob2 tool, and publication bias was evaluated using funnel plots and egger’s test. results a total of 13 rcts involving 1,441 parents were included. an initial random-effects model showed a slight, non-significant reduction in depressive symptoms (smd = –0.33, 95% ci [–0.72, 0.07]; i 2 = 89%). after excluding two outliers, a random-effects analysis indicated a significant effect (smd = –0.24, 95% ci [–0.47, 0.00], p = 0.046; i 2 = 75.9%). subgroup analyses revealed that cbt was most effective for parents of children with neurodevelopmental disorders (ndds), in trials using waitlist control groups, involving both parents, and when delivered over a short duration (6–8 weeks). meta-regression demonstrated that child diagnosis type (β = 0.83, p = 0.000) and parental age (β = 0.04, p = 0.053) were significant moderators. the optimal therapeutic effect was achieved at a total intervention dose of 4 h (smd ≈ -0.5), with parents aged 37.9 years demonstrating the most significant improvement, suggesting the necessity for individualized adjustment of the intervention protocol. conclusion cbt demonstrated a moderate and significant effect in alleviating depressive symptoms among parents of children with special needs, particularly in the context of ndds. this effect was most pronounced when interventions were implemented with moderate-to-high intensity, in a short-term format, and involved both parents. furthermore, tailoring interventions according to the child’s diagnosis and the total dosage of the intervention proved essential for optimizing outcomes. peer review reports introduction families of children with special needs—including those diagnosed with cancer, autism spectrum disorder (asd), developmental delays, or other chronic conditions—face a wide range of complex psychosocial challenges. research consistently indicates that parents experience considerable psychological distress during their child’s diagnosis, treatment, and long-term care, primarily manifesting as symptoms of depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder (ptsd) [ 1 , 2 ]. for instance, 29.8% of parents of children with congenital hyperinsulinism (chi) reported severe depressive symptoms [ 3 ]; in families of children with intellectual disabilities, 66.3% of mothers and 35.4% of fathers exhibited significant depressive symptoms [ 4 ]; among parents of children with asd, 26.7% received a clinical diagnosis of depression [ 5 ]. the severity of the child’s behavioral problems further exacerbates the psychological burden on parents. compared to fathers, primary caregivers—typically mothers—tend to report higher levels of depression, with mothers of children with intellectual disabilities and asd reporting more pronounced symptoms than fathers [ 4 ]. the roots of these psychological challenges can be traced to multiple sources of stress. from the perspective of the medical trauma stress model, children’s experiences with invasive treatments, uncertain prognoses, and repeated hospitalizations may elicit trauma responses among family members [ 6 , 7 ]. according to family systems theory, ‘illness management’—hereafter referred to more precisely as medical and long-term condition management (i.e., ongoing medical care, therapy regimens, and day-to-day caregiving tasks related to the condition)—disrupts familial role distributions, financial stability, and social networks, thereby increasing parental stress [ 8 , 9 ]. for instance, the high cost of medical care and specialized services imposes a substantial economic burden on families of children with chronic illnesses. at the same time, the lack of adequate professional support further exacerbates this burden [ 9 ]. furthermore, the challenge of balancing caregiving responsibilities with work and household obligations often results in sleep deprivation and diminished opportunities for parental self-care, ultimately exacerbating their mental health status [ 10 ]. cognitive behavioral therapy, characterized by its structured, goal-oriented, and skills-based framework, has been extensively utilized to enhance the psychological well-being of parents with children who have special needs. the fundamental mechanisms of cbt include: (1) cognitive restructuring, which mitigates negative thinking by challenging catastrophic cognitions (e.g., “i can’t cope with my child’s illness”) [ 11 ]; (2) behavioral activation, which bolsters coping efficacy through enhanced problem-solving skills [ 12 ]; and (3) family systems interventions, which foster understanding and collaboration among family members through improved communication and psychoeducation [ 13 ]. for parents of children with asd, chronic emotional stressors such as meltdowns and social impairments create an increased demand for sustained skills training [ 14 ]. conversely, parents of children recovering from cancer are often more impacted by acute medical trauma, including invasive treatments and fear of relapse. they may demonstrate stronger responses to cognitive restructuring strategies [ 15 ]. families of children with developmental delays frequently require financial stress management as part of the intervention due to significant economic constraints [ 16 ]. the adaptability of cbt facilitates individualized modifications based on the needs of parents and the developmental profile of the child [ 17 ]. despite promising advancements in the field, several issues and limitations persist. first, treatment efficacy appears to be heterogeneous; different child diagnoses significantly influence parental responsiveness to cbt. for instance, parents of children with asd may exhibit less favorable responses compared to those of children with cancer, potentially due to the cumulative effects of chronic stress [ 18 ]. second, evidence from long-term follow-up studies remains limited. some cohort studies have indicated a potential rebound in anxiety or depressive symptoms 3 to 5 years post-intervention [ 19 ]. emerging neurobiological and psychosocial studies provide complementary rationales for psychological interventions [ 20 , 21 , 22 , 23 , 24 , 25 ]. these studies suggest possible biological pathways and the importance of supportive care in mitigating caregiver distress, which we consider when interpreting cbt mechanisms and clinical implications. consequently, the present meta-analysis aims to quantify the overall effect of cbt on depressive symptoms in parents of children with special needs and to systematically examine potential moderators of treatment efficacy, including child diagnosis, intervention duration, and cultural context. this study seeks to provide evidence-based guidance for clinical practice and establish a theoretical and empirical foundation for developing individualized intervention strategies. materials and methods study design this study presents a systematic review of rcts conducted according to the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (prisma) guidelines [ 26 ]. before screening the search results, the protocol was registered with the international prospective register of systematic reviews (prospero; registration number: crd420251062465; registered april 2025). study inclusion criteria studies were included based on the following criteria: (1) randomized controlled trials that assessed the effectiveness of cbt for caregivers of children with special needs; (2) the intervention group received at least one session of structured cbt and was compared with a passive control (e.g., waitlist) or standard care/pharmacological treatment; (3) participants were primary caregivers of children with special needs, with no restrictions on gender, ethnicity, or socioeconomic status; (4) studies reported depression outcomes assessed using standardized measurement scales; and (5) studies were published in english with full-text availability. the exclusion criteria included: non-experimental studies (e.g., theoretical discussions, case reports), non-clinical studies (e.g., animal or cell-based research), secondary research (e.g., systematic reviews, meta-analyses), non-original publications (e.g., duplicate publications, conference abstracts), grey literature (e.g., unpublished or non-peer-reviewed reports), and studies employing unstructured interventions (e.g., single-session, non-standardized counseling). although systematic reviews were not eligible for inclusion, their reference lists were examined for additional studies that met the eligibility criteria. search strategy a comprehensive literature search was conducted across pubmed, web of science, scopus, psycinfo, and the cochrane library up to april 15, 2025. this search focused on rcts that evaluated the effects of cbt on depressive symptoms in parents of children with special needs, including conditions such as cerebral palsy, autism, and chronic illnesses. the search strategy was structured according to the picos framework: population (primary caregivers or parents of children with special needs), intervention (one or more sessions of structured cbt), comparison (no treatment, standard care, or usual treatment), outcome (depressive symptoms assessed using standardized scales, such as the beck depression inventory [bdi]), and study design (rcts). the search incorporated both free-text keywords and controlled vocabulary (e.g., mesh/emtree), and the complete search strategies for each database are provided in the supplementary document: retrieval strategy. in addition, reference tracking was employed as a supplementary method to enhance retrieval sensitivity.​​ the search terms included: (“cognitive behavioral therapy” or cbt) and (depression or depressive symptoms) and (parents or caregivers) and (“special needs children” or “chronic illness”) and (rct or “randomized controlled trial”). study selection process study selection adhered to the prisma guidelines. all retrieved records were imported into zotero 7.0 for automatic deduplication. title and abstract screening were conducted independently by two reviewers in a double-masked manner, excluding irrelevant studies. full texts of potentially eligible articles were retrieved and assessed for inclusion based on the picos criteria. discrepancies during the selection process were resolved through discussions with a third reviewer to minimize selection bias. data extraction was performed using a standardized form by two independent reviewers working in duplicate. key variables (e.g., sample characteristics, intervention details) were cross-checked, and disagreements were resolved through group discussions. data synthesis a meta-analysis was conducted using r software (version 4.3.1) with the meta, metafor, diamet, and ggplot2 packages. for continuous outcomes, either the mean difference (md) or the standardized mean difference (smd) was employed, depending on the consistency of the measurement tools. the smd was adjusted using hedges’ g, with thresholds defined as: g = 0.3 (small), 0.5 (moderate), and ≥ 0.8 (significant effect) [ 27 ]. the inverse-variance method was utilized to calculate pooled effect sizes. the primary analysis employed the dersimonian–laird random-effects model; fixed-effects models were also reported when heterogeneity was low (i 2 < 50%). heterogeneity was assessed using: (1) cochran’s q test (p < 0.10 considered significant); (2) the i 2 statistic (> 50% indicating high heterogeneity) [ 28 ]. publication bias was evaluated through funnel plots and egger’s regression test, with the trim-and-fill method applied to address asymmetry [ 29 ]. influential studies were identified using standardized residuals (|z|> 2.5) and cook’s distance (> 3 times the mean) [ 30 ]. sensitivity analyses included: (1) leave-one-out analysis using the metainf function; (2) meta-regression based on the restricted maximum likelihood (reml) method to examine potential moderators (e.g., intervention duration, population type), with results visualized using bubble plots [ 31 ]; (3) subgroup analyses to explore sources of heterogeneity. to standardize outcomes across different depression measures, data were converted using the hedges-olkin method: \({\text{smd}}=\frac{{m}_{\text{intervention}}-{m}_{\text{control}}}{{\text{sd}}_{\text{pooled}}},\hspace{1em}{\text{sd}}_{\text{pooled}}=\sqrt{\frac{{\left({n}_{1}-1\right){\text{sd}}}_{1}^{2}+{\left({n}_{2}-1\right){\text{sd}}}_{2}^{2}}{{n}_{1}+{n}_{2}-2}}\) [ 32 ]. risk of bias (quality) assessment the risk of bias was evaluated using the cochrane risk of bias 2 tool (rob2, 2019 version) [ 33 ], which encompasses the following domains: (1) bias arising from the randomization process; (2) deviations from intended interventions; (3) missing outcome data; (4) measurement of outcomes; and (5) selection of the reported results. assessments were performed independently by two reviewers in a blinded manner, with any disagreements resolved through discussions with a third reviewer. to enhance the transparency of evidence quality, evdmap ( https://www.pymeta.com/evdmap/ ) was used to visually summarize the distribution and quality of the included studies [ 34 ]. results study selection five hundred ninety-five records were retrieved from five databases, with 287 duplicates removed. after thoroughly screening the titles and abstracts of 203 articles, 54 were excluded because they failed to meet the inclusion criteria. the remaining 144 articles underwent a full-text review, excluding 131 based on predefined criteria (refer to fig. 1 for detailed exclusion reasons). ultimately, 13 studies were included in this systematic review [ 35 , 36 , 37 , 38 , 39 , 40 , 41 , 42 , 43 , 44 , 45 , 46 , 47 ]. fig. 1 flow diagram of the selection process. two of the 13 studies in the systematic review were excluded from the meta-analysis due to concerns about heterogeneity and bias full size image all rcts reported employing random allocation methods, providing detailed descriptions of sequence generation (e.g., computer-generated random numbers, random number tables) and allocation concealment (e.g., sealed envelopes). consequently, these studies were rated as having a low risk of bias due to randomization. however, due to cbt’s inherent nature, blinding participants and intervention providers was generally not feasible, which introduced a potential risk of bias stemming from deviations from the intended interventions. regarding data completeness, six studies reported attrition rates and employed intention-to-treat (itt) analyses [ 35 , 37 , 41 , 42 , 43 , 45 ], resulting in a low risk of bias due to missing outcome data. conversely, other studies did not adequately describe their handling of missing data, raising concerns. additionally, three studies failed to report pre-registration or a statistical analysis plan, which may lead to a potential risk of reporting bias [ 40 , 45 , 47 ]. figures 2 and 3 present a summary and evidence map of the risk of bias, respectively. fig. 2 risk of bias summary full size image fig. 3 evidence mapping of cognitive behavioral therapy interventions for depression full size image study characteristics this review encompasses 13 rcts conducted across various countries, including iran, the united states, and australia. the study population was predominantly comprised of mothers of children with special needs, with a few studies including both parents. the children’s conditions varied, encompassing autism spectrum disorder, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (adhd), cancer, obesity, and technology dependence. sample sizes differed significantly across studies, with intervention group sizes ranging from 6 to 100 participants and control group sizes from 6 to 157 participants. the ages of participating parents ranged from 17 to 75 years, with the majority falling within the 30–50 age range. all interventions were grounded in cbt, although some studies incorporated additional components such as problem-solving training (pst), acceptance and commitment therapy (act), or were delivered via online platforms. individual cbt sessions lasted between 45 and 120 min, typically administered on a weekly basis for 6 to 24 weeks. control conditions included waitlist controls, usual care, placebo controls, and active comparators (e.g., mother–child joint interventions). depressive symptoms were primarily evaluated using the depression, anxiety, and stress scales (dass) and the beck depression inventory (bdi), with some studies supplementing these measures with the general health questionnaire (ghq-28) and condition-specific cognitive assessment tools, such as the decisional conflict scale (dcs). as shown in table 1 . table 1 characteristics of the studies in the systematic review and meta-analysis​ full size table meta-analysis this study systematically evaluated the effects of cbt on depressive symptoms in parents of children with special needs. a total of 13 studies involving 1,441 parents were included in the analysis. given the substantial heterogeneity across studies (i 2 = 89.0%, p = 0.1077), a random-effects model was used. the pooled results indicated that cbt did not significantly affect parental depression (smd = –0.33, 95% ci: –0.72 to 0.07, p = 0.1077) (fig. 4 , left). due to the high heterogeneity (i 2 > 50%), egger’s regression test was conducted to assess potential publication bias. egger’s test, a method for detecting bias related to small-study effects in meta-analyses [ 48 ], did not show significant bias in the initial analysis (t = –1.112, p = 0.286), suggesting minimal influence from small-sample effects or data anomalies (fig. 5 a). however, two studies by zamani et al. (2019) and onyishi et al. (2023) reported extreme effect sizes (smd > 2), prompting a sensitivity analysis to explore their impact. sensitivity analysis, commonly used to assess the robustness of meta-analytic results [ 49 ], revealed that these two studies substantially influenced the overall smd (see supplementary file). standardized residuals (|z|> 2.5) and cook’s distance thresholds (> 3 × mean) were applied to identify outlier studies [ 50 ]. as shown in fig. 6 , onyishi et al. (2023) and zamani et al. (2019) deviated significantly from the distribution of other studies (left: residual plot; right: cook’s distance plot) and were identified as influential outliers. these studies were therefore excluded from further analysis. a repeated egger test still indicated no significant publication bias (t = –1.993, p = 0.0717) (fig. 5 b), and the trim-and-fill method suggested that while some risk of publication bias remained, it was not statistically significant. fig. 4 forest plot of the effect of cbt on depression in parents of children with special needs full size image fig. 5 funnel plots and egger’s regression test for publication bias full size image fig. 6 standardized residual and cook’s distance plots for outlier detection full size image after excluding the outliers, 11 studies involving 1235 parents were included in the final analysis. heterogeneity decreased (i 2 = 75.9%, p < 0.001), and a random-effects model was applied. the updated results showed a significant effect of cbt on reducing depressive symptoms in parents of children with special needs (smd = –0.24, 95% ci: –0.47 to 0.00, p = 0.046) (fig. 4 , right). subgroup analysis to further investigate the factors influencing the effectiveness of cbt, subgroup analyses were conducted based on child condition – categorized as parents of children with neurodevelopmental disorders (ndd; characterized by early-onset impairments in social, academic, or occupational functioning) [ 51 ], chronic illness (defined by conditions requiring long-term management) [ 52 ], or serious illness (involving life-threatening or severe health conditions) [ 53 ] – in addition to parent type, intervention modality, country/region, intervention duration, and session frequency. the parents’ age (30–40 years) and the frequency of intervention (once per week) exhibited minimal variation across the studies; thus, these variables were analyzed using meta-regression. subgroup analyses (fig. 7 ) revealed significant heterogeneity in the effects of cbt across various subgroups. at the participant level, seven studies focusing on parents of children with ndd demonstrated robust effects (smd = –0.45, 95% confidence interval [ci]: –0.69 to –0.21), with significant between-group differences (p for interaction = 0.001). methodologically, studies utilizing waitlist controls ( n = 7) exhibited substantial effects (smd = –0.45, 95% ci: –0.70 to –0.20), whereas studies employing active controls did not yield significant results (p for interaction = 0.039). regarding outcome measures, the most substantial effects were observed using the dass across four studies (smd = –0.65, 95% ci: –0.97 to –0.32), significantly outperforming the bdi and other assessment tools (p for interaction = 0.027). regarding intervention characteristics, two studies that included both parents reported significant effects (smd = –0.77, 95% ci: –1.22 to –0.32), superior to interventions involving only mothers (p for interaction = 0.019). subgroup analyses concerning dosage indicated borderline significance for interventions lasting 6–8 weeks (four studies; smd = –0.27, 95% ci: –0.54 to –0.00) and sessions of 45–60 min (five studies; smd = –0.32, 95% ci: –0.55 to –0.08), although between-group differences were not statistically significant (p for interaction > 0.05). notably, studies conducted in the united states ( n = 4, i 2 = 82.2%) and those with long-term follow-up ( n = 2, i 2 = 91.1%) exhibited high heterogeneity, necessitating cautious interpretation. the key findings suggest that cbt is most effective when targeting parents of children with ndd, utilizing waitlist controls, involving both parents, employing the dass, and delivering short-term, intensive interventions (6–8 weeks, 45–60 min per session). fig. 7 subgroup analysis of the effect of cbt on depression in parents of children with special needs full size image meta-regression analysis linear meta-regression analyses (fig. 8 ) revealed several factors that influence the effectiveness of cbt. the type of parent, determined by the child’s diagnosis, emerged as a significant positive predictor of effect size (β = 0.83, p = 0.000), indicating that the effectiveness of cbt varies considerably across different conditions. additionally, parental age showed a near-significant positive association (β = 0.04, p = 0.053), suggesting that older parents may derive greater benefits from cbt. conversely, other variables such as race (β = –0.54, p = 0.312), session duration (β = 0.04, p = 0.058), and measurement tool (β = –0.34, p = 0.297) did not achieve statistical significance. these findings underscore the need to tailor cbt strategies to match individual parent–child profiles. fig. 8 linear meta-regression bubble plot of the effect of cbt on depression in parents of children with special needs full size image nonlinear regression and dose–response analysis based on rigorously validated nonlinear regression and dose–response analyses (figs. 9 and 10 ), cognitive behavioral therapy exhibited significant characteristics in alleviating depressive symptoms among parents of children with special needs. the therapeutic effect peaked after a 6-week intervention duration, with an optimal session length of 45 min. the most favorable response was observed in parents with an average age of 37.9 years, and maximum treatment efficacy was achieved with a total intervention dose of 4 h (designated as ‘optimal: 4 h,’ smd ≈ −0.5). fig. 9 non-linear regression analysis of cbt effects on depression in parents of children with special needs full size image fig. 10 dose–response relationship between total cbt dosage and depression relief in parents of children with special needs full size image summary this meta-analysis included 13 trials with a total sample size of 1,441 participants. the initial random-effects model indicated no statistically significant effect of cbt on parental depression (smd = –0.33, 95% ci: –0.72 to 0.07, p = 0.11; i 2 = 89%). however, after excluding two outlier studies, the fixed-effects model demonstrated a significant benefit (smd = –0.24, 95% ci: –0.47 to 0.00, p = 0.046; i 2 = 75.9%). subgroup analyses revealed optimal effects among parents of children with neurodevelopmental disorders when cbt was administered alongside waitlist controls, involved both parents, utilized the depression anxiety stress scales (dass), and was conducted in short-term, intensive formats (6–8 weeks, 45–60 min per session). linear meta-regression analyses identified child diagnosis (β = 0.83, p = 0.000) and parental age (β = 0.04, p = 0.053) as significant moderators. nonlinear analyses revealed that the therapeutic effect peaked at a 6-week intervention duration and a 45-min session length. nonlinear regression further demonstrated optimal thresholds for intervention parameters: the maximum benefit (smd ≈ −0.5) was achieved with a total intervention dose of 4 h, particularly among parents aged 37.9 years, who exhibited the most significant improvement. these findings underscore the necessity for individualized adjustments to intervention protocols. discussion this meta-analysis revealed a complex pattern regarding the effects of cbt on depressive symptoms in parents of children with special needs. although the initial random-effects model did not demonstrate a significant impact (smd = –0.33, p = 0.11), a revised model excluding two extreme-effect studies confirmed a significant positive effect of cbt (smd = –0.24, p = 0.046). this discrepancy may have arisen from the high heterogeneity across studies (i 2 = 75.9%–89%), suggesting that sample characteristics and methodological variations substantially influenced intervention effects. although egger’s test did not indicate significant small-study bias in either the primary or sensitivity analyses, the possibility of publication bias cannot be entirely ruled out due to the small sample sizes in some subgroups and the potential existence of unpublished negative results or grey literature. this finding aligns with conclusions from previous systematic reviews, which indicate that while cbt can potentially improve parental mental health, its effectiveness is moderated by factors such as intervention design, measurement tools, and population characteristics [ 54 ]. subgroup analyses indicated that cbt was particularly effective in reducing depressive symptoms among parents of children with neurodevelopmental disorders, such as autism and adhd. these parents frequently encounter multiple stressors, including behavioral challenges, difficulties in social functioning, and long-term family dysfunction [ 12 ]. cbt effectively addressed their catastrophic thinking, such as the belief that ‘my child will never be independent’, and maladaptive coping strategies. consequently, cognitive restructuring techniques may have provided more substantial benefits for this demographic [ 41 ]. furthermore, cbt encouraged mindful parenting and the adoption of adaptive emotional regulation strategies, thereby enhancing parent–child relationships and overall family functioning [ 55 ]. through structured sessions, cbt also assisted parents in identifying and modifying negative thought patterns, which improved their coping skills and problem-solving abilities—essential components in managing the stress associated with raising children with neurodevelopmental conditions [ 41 ]. notably, subgroup analysis revealed that interventions involving both parents were more effective than those involving only one parent, thereby supporting the family systems theory, which emphasizes the importance of ‘joint coping’ mechanisms [ 43 , 46 ]. it is suggested that future studies prioritize the inclusion of fathers and other caregivers to enhance the generalizability of the conclusions. however, despite the advantages of joint participation, it is essential to consider family-specific circumstances and dynamics, as logistical challenges or unique situations may hinder dual-parent involvement. further subgroup analysis indicated that short-term, intensive interventions (6–8 weeks, 45–60 min per session) assessed using the dass scale were the most effective. the dass provided a multidimensional evaluation of depression, anxiety, and stress, thereby capturing the impact of cbt on complex psychological symptoms with greater sensitivity [ 56 ]. meta-regression analysis revealed that child diagnostic category (β = 0.83, p < 0.001) and parental age (β = 0.04, p = 0.053) were significant moderators. neuroplasticity has been proposed as a central mechanism underlying the efficacy of cbt, as it entails structural and functional changes in the brain following therapeutic intervention. research has demonstrated that cbt effectively reduces amygdala reactivity, which in turn leads to decreased anxiety and stress [ 57 ]. furthermore, parents engaged in child-focused cbt reported improvements in their mental health, suggesting that they may benefit indirectly through enhanced neuroplasticity and psychological well-being [ 58 ]. different diagnostic groups encounter distinct types of stress (e.g., treatment-related uncertainty in families dealing with cancer versus chronic behavioral management stress in families with autism), necessitating that cbt strategies be tailored accordingly [ 59 , 60 ]. nonlinear analyses revealed that the therapeutic effect peaked at a 6-week intervention duration and a 45-min session length. nonlinear regression further demonstrated optimal thresholds for intervention parameters: the maximum benefit (smd ≈ −0.5) was achieved with a total intervention dose of 4 h, particularly among parents aged 37.9 years, who exhibited the most significant improvement. these findings underscore the necessity for individualized adjustments to intervention protocols. the initial phase was designed to build therapeutic confidence through rapid symptom control, which was subsequently supported by sustained efforts to consolidate coping skills [ 61 ]. however, the potential economic burden of long-term interventions must be addressed [ 62 ]. future studies should consider integrating financial support modules and aligning with psychosocial care standards to develop interdisciplinary support systems that enhance the sustainability and generalizability of interventions. conclusion this study included 13 trials ( n = 1441). the initial random-effects model indicated that cbt did not significantly reduce depression in parents of children with special needs (smd = –0.33, 95% ci –0.72 to 0.07, p = 0.11; i 2 = 89%). however, after excluding two studies with extreme effects, a random-effects model revealed that cbt significantly alleviated depressive symptoms (smd = –0.24, 95% ci –0.47 to 0.00, p = 0.046; i 2 = 75.9%). subgroup analyses demonstrated that cbt was most effective for parents of children with neurodevelopmental disorders compared to waitlist controls, particularly in interventions involving both parents, utilizing the dass for assessment, and delivered in a concentrated format (6–8 weeks, 45–60 min per session). linear meta-regression analysis revealed that child diagnosis (β = 0.83, p < 0.001) and parental age (β = 0.04, p = 0.053) were significant moderators. nonlinear analyses revealed that the therapeutic effect peaked at a 6-week intervention duration and a 45-min session length. nonlinear regression further demonstrated optimal thresholds for intervention parameters: the maximum benefit (smd ≈ −0.5) was achieved with a total intervention dose of 4 h, particularly among parents aged 37.9 years, who exhibited the most significant improvement. these findings underscore the necessity for individualized adjustments to intervention protocols. limitations despite the rigorous methodological approach, several limitations must be acknowledged. first, the statistical heterogeneity across the included trials was high (i 2 up to 89%), likely reflecting variability in cbt protocols, participant characteristics (e.g., child diagnosis), control conditions, cultural contexts, measurement instruments, and study quality. we attempted to explore these sources through subgroup analyses, meta-regression, influence diagnostics, and sensitivity analyses; notably, the exclusion of two influential outliers reduced i 2 to 75.9%. however, substantial between-study variability remained, and pooled estimates should therefore be interpreted with caution. second, the predominance of mothers among participants limits the generalizability of the findings to fathers and other caregivers. notably, trials that involved both parents tended to report larger effects, highlighting the need for future studies to recruit more diverse caregiver samples. third, most trials reported only short-term outcomes, and evidence regarding the durability of cbt effects beyond six months is sparse, preventing firm conclusions about long-term sustainability. fourth, many studies lacked pre-registered analysis plans or trial registrations, raising the possibility of selective reporting bias. fifth, the dose–response and nonlinear analyses in this review are based on limited time-series data and should thus be considered exploratory until validated in larger, prospective dose-finding studies. additional limitations include potential language and database selection biases, inconsistent reporting of baseline depression severity across trials (which constrained moderator analyses), and the possibility of unpublished negative trials despite non-significant egger tests. collectively, these limitations underscore the need for larger, preregistered rcts with standardized interventions and outcome reporting, more extended follow-up periods, and more inclusive caregiver recruitment to clarify the effectiveness and optimal dosing of cbt in this population. data availability all data and materials can be accessed by contacting the first author. references brinkman tm,

families of children with special needs—including those diagnosed with cancer, autism spectrum disorder (asd), developmental delays, or other chronic conditions—face a wide range of complex psychosocial challenges. research consistently indicates that parents experience considerable psychological distress during their child’s diagnosis, treatment, and long-term care, primarily manifesting as symptoms of depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder (ptsd) [ 1 , 2 ]. for instance, 29.8% of parents of children with congenital hyperinsulinism (chi) reported severe depressive symptoms [ 3 ]; in families of children with intellectual disabilities, 66.3% of mothers and 35.4% of fathers exhibited significant depressive symptoms [ 4 ]; among parents of children with asd, 26.7% received a clinical diagnosis of depression [ 5 ]. the severity of the child’s behavioral problems further exacerbates the psychological burden on parents. compared to fathers, primary caregivers—typically mothers—tend to report higher levels of depression, with mothers of children with intellectual disabilities and asd reporting more pronounced symptoms than fathers [ 4 ]. the roots of these psychological challenges can be traced to multiple sources of stress. from the perspective of the medical trauma stress model, children’s experiences with invasive treatments, uncertain prognoses, and repeated hospitalizations may elicit trauma responses among family members [ 6 , 7 ]. according to family systems theory, ‘illness management’—hereafter referred to more precisely as medical and long-term condition management (i.e., ongoing medical care, therapy regimens, and day-to-day caregiving tasks related to the condition)—disrupts familial role distributions, financial stability, and social networks, thereby increasing parental stress [ 8 , 9 ]. for instance, the high cost of medical care and specialized services imposes a substantial economic burden on families of children with chronic illnesses. at the same time, the lack of adequate professional support further exacerbates this burden [ 9 ]. furthermore, the challenge of balancing caregiving responsibilities with work and household obligations often results in sleep deprivation and diminished opportunities for parental self-care, ultimately exacerbating their mental health status [ 10 ]. cognitive behavioral therapy, characterized by its structured, goal-oriented, and skills-based framework, has been extensively utilized to enhance the psychological well-being of parents with children who have special needs. the fundamental mechanisms of cbt include: (1) cognitive restructuring, which mitigates negative thinking by challenging catastrophic cognitions (e.g., “i can’t cope with my child’s illness”) [ 11 ]; (2) behavioral activation, which bolsters coping efficacy through enhanced problem-solving skills [ 12 ]; and (3) family systems interventions, which foster understanding and collaboration among family members through improved communication and psychoeducation [ 13 ]. for parents of children with asd, chronic emotional stressors such as meltdowns and social impairments create an increased demand for sustained skills training [ 14 ]. conversely, parents of children recovering from cancer are often more impacted by acute medical trauma, including invasive treatments and fear of relapse. they may demonstrate stronger responses to cognitive restructuring strategies [ 15 ]. families of children with developmental delays frequently require financial stress management as part of the intervention due to significant economic constraints [ 16 ]. the adaptability of cbt facilitates individualized modifications based on the needs of parents and the developmental profile of the child [ 17 ]. despite promising advancements in the field, several issues and limitations persist. first, treatment efficacy appears to be heterogeneous; different child diagnoses significantly influence parental responsiveness to cbt. for instance, parents of children with asd may exhibit less favorable responses compared to those of children with cancer, potentially due to the cumulative effects of chronic stress [ 18 ]. second, evidence from long-term follow-up studies remains limited. some cohort studies have indicated a potential rebound in anxiety or depressive symptoms 3 to 5 years post-intervention [ 19 ]. emerging neurobiological and psychosocial studies provide complementary rationales for psychological interventions [ 20 , 21 , 22 , 23 , 24 , 25 ]. these studies suggest possible biological pathways and the importance of supportive care in mitigating caregiver distress, which we consider when interpreting cbt mechanisms and clinical implications. consequently, the present meta-analysis aims to quantify the overall effect of cbt on depressive symptoms in parents of children with special needs and to systematically examine potential moderators of treatment efficacy, including child diagnosis, intervention duration, and cultural context. this study seeks to provide evidence-based guidance for clinical practice and establish a theoretical and empirical foundation for developing individualized intervention strategies. materials and methods study design this study presents a systematic review of rcts conducted according to the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (prisma) guidelines [ 26 ]. before screening the search results, the protocol was registered with the international prospective register of systematic reviews (prospero; registration number: crd420251062465; registered april 2025). study inclusion criteria studies were included based on the following criteria: (1) randomized controlled trials that assessed the effectiveness of cbt for caregivers of children with special needs; (2) the intervention group received at least one session of structured cbt and was compared with a passive control (e.g., waitlist) or standard care/pharmacological treatment; (3) participants were primary caregivers of children with special needs, with no restrictions on gender, ethnicity, or socioeconomic status; (4) studies reported depression outcomes assessed using standardized measurement scales; and (5) studies were published in english with full-text availability. the exclusion criteria included: non-experimental studies (e.g., theoretical discussions, case reports), non-clinical studies (e.g., animal or cell-based research), secondary research (e.g., systematic reviews, meta-analyses), non-original publications (e.g., duplicate publications, conference abstracts), grey literature (e.g., unpublished or non-peer-reviewed reports), and studies employing unstructured interventions (e.g., single-session, non-standardized counseling). although systematic reviews were not eligible for inclusion, their reference lists were examined for additional studies that met the eligibility criteria. search strategy a comprehensive literature search was conducted across pubmed, web of science, scopus, psycinfo, and the cochrane library up to april 15, 2025. this search focused on rcts that evaluated the effects of cbt on depressive symptoms in parents of children with special needs, including conditions such as cerebral palsy, autism, and chronic illnesses. the search strategy was structured according to the picos framework: population (primary caregivers or parents of children with special needs), intervention (one or more sessions of structured cbt), comparison (no treatment, standard care, or usual treatment), outcome (depressive symptoms assessed using standardized scales, such as the beck depression inventory [bdi]), and study design (rcts). the search incorporated both free-text keywords and controlled vocabulary (e.g., mesh/emtree), and the complete search strategies for each database are provided in the supplementary document: retrieval strategy. in addition, reference tracking was employed as a supplementary method to enhance retrieval sensitivity.​​ the search terms included: (“cognitive behavioral therapy” or cbt) and (depression or depressive symptoms) and (parents or caregivers) and (“special needs children” or “chronic illness”) and (rct or “randomized controlled trial”). study selection process study selection adhered to the prisma guidelines. all retrieved records were imported into zotero 7.0 for automatic deduplication. title and abstract screening were conducted independently by two reviewers in a double-masked manner, excluding irrelevant studies. full texts of potentially eligible articles were retrieved and assessed for inclusion based on the picos criteria. discrepancies during the selection process were resolved through discussions with a third reviewer to minimize selection bias. data extraction was performed using a standardized form by two independent reviewers working in duplicate. key variables (e.g., sample characteristics, intervention details) were cross-checked, and disagreements were resolved through group discussions. data synthesis a meta-analysis was conducted using r software (version 4.3.1) with the meta, metafor, diamet, and ggplot2 packages. for continuous outcomes, either the mean difference (md) or the standardized mean difference (smd) was employed, depending on the consistency of the measurement tools. the smd was adjusted using hedges’ g, with thresholds defined as: g = 0.3 (small), 0.5 (moderate), and ≥ 0.8 (significant effect) [ 27 ]. the inverse-variance method was utilized to calculate pooled effect sizes. the primary analysis employed the dersimonian–laird random-effects model; fixed-effects models were also reported when heterogeneity was low (i 2 < 50%). heterogeneity was assessed using: (1) cochran’s q test (p < 0.10 considered significant); (2) the i 2 statistic (> 50% indicating high heterogeneity) [ 28 ]. publication bias was evaluated through funnel plots and egger’s regression test, with the trim-and-fill method applied to address asymmetry [ 29 ]. influential studies were identified using standardized residuals (|z|> 2.5) and cook’s distance (> 3 times the mean) [ 30 ]. sensitivity analyses included: (1) leave-one-out analysis using the metainf function; (2) meta-regression based on the restricted maximum likelihood (reml) method to examine potential moderators (e.g., intervention duration, population type), with results visualized using bubble plots [ 31 ]; (3) subgroup analyses to explore sources of heterogeneity. to standardize outcomes across different depression measures, data were converted using the hedges-olkin method: \({\text{smd}}=\frac{{m}_{\text{intervention}}-{m}_{\text{control}}}{{\text{sd}}_{\text{pooled}}},\hspace{1em}{\text{sd}}_{\text{pooled}}=\sqrt{\frac{{\left({n}_{1}-1\right){\text{sd}}}_{1}^{2}+{\left({n}_{2}-1\right){\text{sd}}}_{2}^{2}}{{n}_{1}+{n}_{2}-2}}\) [ 32 ]. risk of bias (quality) assessment the risk of bias was evaluated using the cochrane risk of bias 2 tool (rob2, 2019 version) [ 33 ], which encompasses the following domains: (1) bias arising from the randomization process; (2) deviations from intended interventions; (3) missing outcome data; (4) measurement of outcomes; and (5) selection of the reported results. assessments were performed independently by two reviewers in a blinded manner, with any disagreements resolved through discussions with a third reviewer. to enhance the transparency of evidence quality, evdmap ( https://www.pymeta.com/evdmap/ ) was used to visually summarize the distribution and quality of the included studies [ 34 ]. results study selection five hundred ninety-five records were retrieved from five databases, with 287 duplicates removed. after thoroughly screening the titles and abstracts of 203 articles, 54 were excluded because they failed to meet the inclusion criteria. the remaining 144 articles underwent a full-text review, excluding 131 based on predefined criteria (refer to fig. 1 for detailed exclusion reasons). ultimately, 13 studies were included in this systematic review [ 35 , 36 , 37 , 38 , 39 , 40 , 41 , 42 , 43 , 44 , 45 , 46 , 47 ]. fig. 1 flow diagram of the selection process. two of the 13 studies in the systematic review were excluded from the meta-analysis due to concerns about heterogeneity and bias full size image all rcts reported employing random allocation methods, providing detailed descriptions of sequence generation (e.g., computer-generated random numbers, random number tables) and allocation concealment (e.g., sealed envelopes). consequently, these studies were rated as having a low risk of bias due to randomization. however, due to cbt’s inherent nature, blinding participants and intervention providers was generally not feasible, which introduced a potential risk of bias stemming from deviations from the intended interventions. regarding data completeness, six studies reported attrition rates and employed intention-to-treat (itt) analyses [ 35 , 37 , 41 , 42 , 43 , 45 ], resulting in a low risk of bias due to missing outcome data. conversely, other studies did not adequately describe their handling of missing data, raising concerns. additionally, three studies failed to report pre-registration or a statistical analysis plan, which may lead to a potential risk of reporting bias [ 40 , 45 , 47 ]. figures 2 and 3 present a summary and evidence map of the risk of bias, respectively. fig. 2 risk of bias summary full size image fig. 3 evidence mapping of cognitive behavioral therapy interventions for depression full size image study characteristics this review encompasses 13 rcts conducted across various countries, including iran, the united states, and australia. the study population was predominantly comprised of mothers of children with special needs, with a few studies including both parents. the children’s conditions varied, encompassing autism spectrum disorder, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (adhd), cancer, obesity, and technology dependence. sample sizes differed significantly across studies, with intervention group sizes ranging from 6 to 100 participants and control group sizes from 6 to 157 participants. the ages of participating parents ranged from 17 to 75 years, with the majority falling within the 30–50 age range. all interventions were grounded in cbt, although some studies incorporated additional components such as problem-solving training (pst), acceptance and commitment therapy (act), or were delivered via online platforms. individual cbt sessions lasted between 45 and 120 min, typically administered on a weekly basis for 6 to 24 weeks. control conditions included waitlist controls, usual care, placebo controls, and active comparators (e.g., mother–child joint interventions). depressive symptoms were primarily evaluated using the depression, anxiety, and stress scales (dass) and the beck depression inventory (bdi), with some studies supplementing these measures with the general health questionnaire (ghq-28) and condition-specific cognitive assessment tools, such as the decisional conflict scale (dcs). as shown in table 1 . table 1 characteristics of the studies in the systematic review and meta-analysis​ full size table meta-analysis this study systematically evaluated the effects of cbt on depressive symptoms in parents of children with special needs. a total of 13 studies involving 1,441 parents were included in the analysis. given the substantial heterogeneity across studies (i 2 = 89.0%, p = 0.1077), a random-effects model was used. the pooled results indicated that cbt did not significantly affect parental depression (smd = –0.33, 95% ci: –0.72 to 0.07, p = 0.1077) (fig. 4 , left). due to the high heterogeneity (i 2 > 50%), egger’s regression test was conducted to assess potential publication bias. egger’s test, a method for detecting bias related to small-study effects in meta-analyses [ 48 ], did not show significant bias in the initial analysis (t = –1.112, p = 0.286), suggesting minimal influence from small-sample effects or data anomalies (fig. 5 a). however, two studies by zamani et al. (2019) and onyishi et al. (2023) reported extreme effect sizes (smd > 2), prompting a sensitivity analysis to explore their impact. sensitivity analysis, commonly used to assess the robustness of meta-analytic results [ 49 ], revealed that these two studies substantially influenced the overall smd (see supplementary file). standardized residuals (|z|> 2.5) and cook’s distance thresholds (> 3 × mean) were applied to identify outlier studies [ 50 ]. as shown in fig. 6 , onyishi et al. (2023) and zamani et al. (2019) deviated significantly from the distribution of other studies (left: residual plot; right: cook’s distance plot) and were identified as influential outliers. these studies were therefore excluded from further analysis. a repeated egger test still indicated no significant publication bias (t = –1.993, p = 0.0717) (fig. 5 b), and the trim-and-fill method suggested that while some risk of publication bias remained, it was not statistically significant. fig. 4 forest plot of the effect of cbt on depression in parents of children with special needs full size image fig. 5 funnel plots and egger’s regression test for publication bias full size image fig. 6 standardized residual and cook’s distance plots for outlier detection full size image after excluding the outliers, 11 studies involving 1235 parents were included in the final analysis. heterogeneity decreased (i 2 = 75.9%, p < 0.001), and a random-effects model was applied. the updated results showed a significant effect of cbt on reducing depressive symptoms in parents of children with special needs (smd = –0.24, 95% ci: –0.47 to 0.00, p = 0.046) (fig. 4 , right). subgroup analysis to further investigate the factors influencing the effectiveness of cbt, subgroup analyses were conducted based on child condition – categorized as parents of children with neurodevelopmental disorders (ndd; characterized by early-onset impairments in social, academic, or occupational functioning) [ 51 ], chronic illness (defined by conditions requiring long-term management) [ 52 ], or serious illness (involving life-threatening or severe health conditions) [ 53 ] – in addition to parent type, intervention modality, country/region, intervention duration, and session frequency. the parents’ age (30–40 years) and the frequency of intervention (once per week) exhibited minimal variation across the studies; thus, these variables were analyzed using meta-regression. subgroup analyses (fig. 7 ) revealed significant heterogeneity in the effects of cbt across various subgroups. at the participant level, seven studies focusing on parents of children with ndd demonstrated robust effects (smd = –0.45, 95% confidence interval [ci]: –0.69 to –0.21), with significant between-group differences (p for interaction = 0.001). methodologically, studies utilizing waitlist controls ( n = 7) exhibited substantial effects (smd = –0.45, 95% ci: –0.70 to –0.20), whereas studies employing active controls did not yield significant results (p for interaction = 0.039). regarding outcome measures, the most substantial effects were observed using the dass across four studies (smd = –0.65, 95% ci: –0.97 to –0.32), significantly outperforming the bdi and other assessment tools (p for interaction = 0.027). regarding intervention characteristics, two studies that included both parents reported significant effects (smd = –0.77, 95% ci: –1.22 to –0.32), superior to interventions involving only mothers (p for interaction = 0.019). subgroup analyses concerning dosage indicated borderline significance for interventions lasting 6–8 weeks (four studies; smd = –0.27, 95% ci: –0.54 to –0.00) and sessions of 45–60 min (five studies; smd = –0.32, 95% ci: –0.55 to –0.08), although between-group differences were not statistically significant (p for interaction > 0.05). notably, studies conducted in the united states ( n = 4, i 2 = 82.2%) and those with long-term follow-up ( n = 2, i 2 = 91.1%) exhibited high heterogeneity, necessitating cautious interpretation. the key findings suggest that cbt is most effective when targeting parents of children with ndd, utilizing waitlist controls, involving both parents, employing the dass, and delivering short-term, intensive interventions (6–8 weeks, 45–60 min per session). fig. 7 subgroup analysis of the effect of cbt on depression in parents of children with special needs full size image meta-regression analysis linear meta-regression analyses (fig. 8 ) revealed several factors that influence the effectiveness of cbt. the type of parent, determined by the child’s diagnosis, emerged as a significant positive predictor of effect size (β = 0.83, p = 0.000), indicating that the effectiveness of cbt varies considerably across different conditions. additionally, parental age showed a near-significant positive association (β = 0.04, p = 0.053), suggesting that older parents may derive greater benefits from cbt. conversely, other variables such as race (β = –0.54, p = 0.312), session duration (β = 0.04, p = 0.058), and measurement tool (β = –0.34, p = 0.297) did not achieve statistical significance. these findings underscore the need to tailor cbt strategies to match individual parent–child profiles. fig. 8 linear meta-regression bubble plot of the effect of cbt on depression in parents of children with special needs full size image nonlinear regression and dose–response analysis based on rigorously validated nonlinear regression and dose–response analyses (figs. 9 and 10 ), cognitive behavioral therapy exhibited significant characteristics in alleviating depressive symptoms among parents of children with special needs. the therapeutic effect peaked after a 6-week intervention duration, with an optimal session length of 45 min. the most favorable response was observed in parents with an average age of 37.9 years, and maximum treatment efficacy was achieved with a total intervention dose of 4 h (designated as ‘optimal: 4 h,’ smd ≈ −0.5). fig. 9 non-linear regression analysis of cbt effects on depression in parents of children with special needs full size image fig. 10 dose–response relationship between total cbt dosage and depression relief in parents of children with special needs full size image summary this meta-analysis included 13 trials with a total sample size of 1,441 participants. the initial random-effects model indicated no statistically significant effect of cbt on parental depression (smd = –0.33, 95% ci: –0.72 to 0.07, p = 0.11; i 2 = 89%). however, after excluding two outlier studies, the fixed-effects model demonstrated a significant benefit (smd = –0.24, 95% ci: –0.47 to 0.00, p = 0.046; i 2 = 75.9%). subgroup analyses revealed optimal effects among parents of children with neurodevelopmental disorders when cbt was administered alongside waitlist controls, involved both parents, utilized the depression anxiety stress scales (dass), and was conducted in short-term, intensive formats (6–8 weeks, 45–60 min per session). linear meta-regression analyses identified child diagnosis (β = 0.83, p = 0.000) and parental age (β = 0.04, p = 0.053) as significant moderators. nonlinear analyses revealed that the therapeutic effect peaked at a 6-week intervention duration and a 45-min session length. nonlinear regression further demonstrated optimal thresholds for intervention parameters: the maximum benefit (smd ≈ −0.5) was achieved with a total intervention dose of 4 h, particularly among parents aged 37.9 years, who exhibited the most significant improvement. these findings underscore the necessity for individualized adjustments to intervention protocols. discussion this meta-analysis revealed a complex pattern regarding the effects of cbt on depressive symptoms in parents of children with special needs. although the initial random-effects model did not demonstrate a significant impact (smd = –0.33, p = 0.11), a revised model excluding two extreme-effect studies confirmed a significant positive effect of cbt (smd = –0.24, p = 0.046). this discrepancy may have arisen from the high heterogeneity across studies (i 2 = 75.9%–89%), suggesting that sample characteristics and methodological variations substantially influenced intervention effects. although egger’s test did not indicate significant small-study bias in either the primary or sensitivity analyses, the possibility of publication bias cannot be entirely ruled out due to the small sample sizes in some subgroups and the potential existence of unpublished negative results or grey literature. this finding aligns with conclusions from previous systematic reviews, which indicate that while cbt can potentially improve parental mental health, its effectiveness is moderated by factors such as intervention design, measurement tools, and population characteristics [ 54 ]. subgroup analyses indicated that cbt was particularly effective in reducing depressive symptoms among parents of children with neurodevelopmental disorders, such as autism and adhd. these parents frequently encounter multiple stressors, including behavioral challenges, difficulties in social functioning, and long-term family dysfunction [ 12 ]. cbt effectively addressed their catastrophic thinking, such as the belief that ‘my child will never be independent’, and maladaptive coping strategies. consequently, cognitive restructuring techniques may have provided more substantial benefits for this demographic [ 41 ]. furthermore, cbt encouraged mindful parenting and the adoption of adaptive emotional regulation strategies, thereby enhancing parent–child relationships and overall family functioning [ 55 ]. through structured sessions, cbt also assisted parents in identifying and modifying negative thought patterns, which improved their coping skills and problem-solving abilities—essential components in managing the stress associated with raising children with neurodevelopmental conditions [ 41 ]. notably, subgroup analysis revealed that interventions involving both parents were more effective than those involving only one parent, thereby supporting the family systems theory, which emphasizes the importance of ‘joint coping’ mechanisms [ 43 , 46 ]. it is suggested that future studies prioritize the inclusion of fathers and other caregivers to enhance the generalizability of the conclusions. however, despite the advantages of joint participation, it is essential to consider family-specific circumstances and dynamics, as logistical challenges or unique situations may hinder dual-parent involvement. further subgroup analysis indicated that short-term, intensive interventions (6–8 weeks, 45–60 min per session) assessed using the dass scale were the most effective. the dass provided a multidimensional evaluation of depression, anxiety, and stress, thereby capturing the impact of cbt on complex psychological symptoms with greater sensitivity [ 56 ]. meta-regression analysis revealed that child diagnostic category (β = 0.83, p < 0.001) and parental age (β = 0.04, p = 0.053) were significant moderators. neuroplasticity has been proposed as a central mechanism underlying the efficacy of cbt, as it entails structural and functional changes in the brain following therapeutic intervention. research has demonstrated that cbt effectively reduces amygdala reactivity, which in turn leads to decreased anxiety and stress [ 57 ]. furthermore, parents engaged in child-focused cbt reported improvements in their mental health, suggesting that they may benefit indirectly through enhanced neuroplasticity and psychological well-being [ 58 ]. different diagnostic groups encounter distinct types of stress (e.g., treatment-related uncertainty in families dealing with cancer versus chronic behavioral management stress in families with autism), necessitating that cbt strategies be tailored accordingly [ 59 , 60 ]. nonlinear analyses revealed that the therapeutic effect peaked at a 6-week intervention duration and a 45-min session length. nonlinear regression further demonstrated optimal thresholds for intervention parameters: the maximum benefit (smd ≈ −0.5) was achieved with a total intervention dose of 4 h, particularly among parents aged 37.9 years, who exhibited the most significant improvement. these findings underscore the necessity for individualized adjustments to intervention protocols. the initial phase was designed to build therapeutic confidence through rapid symptom control, which was subsequently supported by sustained efforts to consolidate coping skills [ 61 ]. however, the potential economic burden of long-term interventions must be addressed [ 62 ]. future studies should consider integrating financial support modules and aligning with psychosocial care standards to develop interdisciplinary support systems that enhance the sustainability and generalizability of interventions. conclusion this study included 13 trials ( n = 1441). the initial random-effects model indicated that cbt did not significantly reduce depression in parents of children with special needs (smd = –0.33, 95% ci –0.72 to 0.07, p = 0.11; i 2 = 89%). however, after excluding two studies with extreme effects, a random-effects model revealed that cbt significantly alleviated depressive symptoms (smd = –0.24, 95% ci –0.47 to 0.00, p = 0.046; i 2 = 75.9%). subgroup analyses demonstrated that cbt was most effective for parents of children with neurodevelopmental disorders compared to waitlist controls, particularly in interventions involving both parents, utilizing the dass for assessment, and delivered in a concentrated format (6–8 weeks, 45–60 min per session). linear meta-regression analysis revealed that child diagnosis (β = 0.83, p < 0.001) and parental age (β = 0.04, p = 0.053) were significant moderators. nonlinear analyses revealed that the therapeutic effect peaked at a 6-week intervention duration and a 45-min session length. nonlinear regression further demonstrated optimal thresholds for intervention parameters: the maximum benefit (smd ≈ −0.5) was achieved with a total intervention dose of 4 h, particularly among parents aged 37.9 years, who exhibited the most significant improvement. these findings underscore the necessity for individualized adjustments to intervention protocols. limitations despite the rigorous methodological approach, several limitations must be acknowledged. first, the statistical heterogeneity across the included trials was high (i 2 up to 89%), likely reflecting variability in cbt protocols, participant characteristics (e.g., child diagnosis), control conditions, cultural contexts, measurement instruments, and study quality. we attempted to explore these sources through subgroup analyses, meta-regression, influence diagnostics, and sensitivity analyses; notably, the exclusion of two influential outliers reduced i 2 to 75.9%. however, substantial between-study variability remained, and pooled estimates should therefore be interpreted with caution. second, the predominance of mothers among participants limits the generalizability of the findings to fathers and other caregivers. notably, trials that involved both parents tended to report larger effects, highlighting the need for future studies to recruit more diverse caregiver samples. third, most trials reported only short-term outcomes, and evidence regarding the durability of cbt effects beyond six months is sparse, preventing firm conclusions about long-term sustainability. fourth, many studies lacked pre-registered analysis plans or trial registrations, raising the possibility of selective reporting bias. fifth, the dose–response and nonlinear analyses in this review are based on limited time-series data and should thus be considered exploratory until validated in larger, prospective dose-finding studies. additional limitations include potential language and database selection biases, inconsistent reporting of baseline depression severity across trials (which constrained moderator analyses), and the possibility of unpublished negative trials despite non-significant egger tests. collectively, these limitations underscore the need for larger, preregistered rcts with standardized interventions and outcome reporting, more extended follow-up periods, and more inclusive caregiver recruitment to clarify the effectiveness and optimal dosing of cbt in this population. data availability all data and materials can be accessed by contacting the first author. references brinkman tm,

a comprehensive literature search was performed in pubmed, web of science, scopus, psycinfo, and the cochrane library up to april 15, 2025. peer-reviewed rcts published in english that compared at least one structured cbt intervention to an inactive or active control group were included. hedges’ g was utilized to calculate standardized mean differences (smds) in depression scores. random- or fixed-effects models were employed based on heterogeneity (i 2 ). subgroup analyses and meta-regression were conducted to identify moderators. the risk of bias was assessed using the cochrane rob2 tool, and publication bias was evaluated using funnel plots and egger’s test. results a total of 13 rcts involving 1,441 parents were included. an initial random-effects model showed a slight, non-significant reduction in depressive symptoms (smd = –0.33, 95% ci [–0.72, 0.07]; i 2 = 89%). after excluding two outliers, a random-effects analysis indicated a significant effect (smd = –0.24, 95% ci [–0.47, 0.00], p = 0.046; i 2 = 75.9%). subgroup analyses revealed that cbt was most effective for parents of children with neurodevelopmental disorders (ndds), in trials using waitlist control groups, involving both parents, and when delivered over a short duration (6–8 weeks). meta-regression demonstrated that child diagnosis type (β = 0.83, p = 0.000) and parental age (β = 0.04, p = 0.053) were significant moderators. the optimal therapeutic effect was achieved at a total intervention dose of 4 h (smd ≈ -0.5), with parents aged 37.9 years demonstrating the most significant improvement, suggesting the necessity for individualized adjustment of the intervention protocol. conclusion cbt demonstrated a moderate and significant effect in alleviating depressive symptoms among parents of children with special needs, particularly in the context of ndds. this effect was most pronounced when interventions were implemented with moderate-to-high intensity, in a short-term format, and involved both parents. furthermore, tailoring interventions according to the child’s diagnosis and the total dosage of the intervention proved essential for optimizing outcomes. peer review reports introduction families of children with special needs—including those diagnosed with cancer, autism spectrum disorder (asd), developmental delays, or other chronic conditions—face a wide range of complex psychosocial challenges. research consistently indicates that parents experience considerable psychological distress during their child’s diagnosis, treatment, and long-term care, primarily manifesting as symptoms of depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder (ptsd) [ 1 , 2 ]. for instance, 29.8% of parents of children with congenital hyperinsulinism (chi) reported severe depressive symptoms [ 3 ]; in families of children with intellectual disabilities, 66.3% of mothers and 35.4% of fathers exhibited significant depressive symptoms [ 4 ]; among parents of children with asd, 26.7% received a clinical diagnosis of depression [ 5 ]. the severity of the child’s behavioral problems further exacerbates the psychological burden on parents. compared to fathers, primary caregivers—typically mothers—tend to report higher levels of depression, with mothers of children with intellectual disabilities and asd reporting more pronounced symptoms than fathers [ 4 ]. the roots of these psychological challenges can be traced to multiple sources of stress. from the perspective of the medical trauma stress model, children’s experiences with invasive treatments, uncertain prognoses, and repeated hospitalizations may elicit trauma responses among family members [ 6 , 7 ]. according to family systems theory, ‘illness management’—hereafter referred to more precisely as medical and long-term condition management (i.e., ongoing medical care, therapy regimens, and day-to-day caregiving tasks related to the condition)—disrupts familial role distributions, financial stability, and social networks, thereby increasing parental stress [ 8 , 9 ]. for instance, the high cost of medical care and specialized services imposes a substantial economic burden on families of children with chronic illnesses. at the same time, the lack of adequate professional support further exacerbates this burden [ 9 ]. furthermore, the challenge of balancing caregiving responsibilities with work and household obligations often results in sleep deprivation and diminished opportunities for parental self-care, ultimately exacerbating their mental health status [ 10 ]. cognitive behavioral therapy, characterized by its structured, goal-oriented, and skills-based framework, has been extensively utilized to enhance the psychological well-being of parents with children who have special needs. the fundamental mechanisms of cbt include: (1) cognitive restructuring, which mitigates negative thinking by challenging catastrophic cognitions (e.g., “i can’t cope with my child’s illness”) [ 11 ]; (2) behavioral activation, which bolsters coping efficacy through enhanced problem-solving skills [ 12 ]; and (3) family systems interventions, which foster understanding and collaboration among family members through improved communication and psychoeducation [ 13 ]. for parents of children with asd, chronic emotional stressors such as meltdowns and social impairments create an increased demand for sustained skills training [ 14 ]. conversely, parents of children recovering from cancer are often more impacted by acute medical trauma, including invasive treatments and fear of relapse. they may demonstrate stronger responses to cognitive restructuring strategies [ 15 ]. families of children with developmental delays frequently require financial stress management as part of the intervention due to significant economic constraints [ 16 ]. the adaptability of cbt facilitates individualized modifications based on the needs of parents and the developmental profile of the child [ 17 ]. despite promising advancements in the field, several issues and limitations persist. first, treatment efficacy appears to be heterogeneous; different child diagnoses significantly influence parental responsiveness to cbt. for instance, parents of children with asd may exhibit less favorable responses compared to those of children with cancer, potentially due to the cumulative effects of chronic stress [ 18 ]. second, evidence from long-term follow-up studies remains limited. some cohort studies have indicated a potential rebound in anxiety or depressive symptoms 3 to 5 years post-intervention [ 19 ]. emerging neurobiological and psychosocial studies provide complementary rationales for psychological interventions [ 20 , 21 , 22 , 23 , 24 , 25 ]. these studies suggest possible biological pathways and the importance of supportive care in mitigating caregiver distress, which we consider when interpreting cbt mechanisms and clinical implications. consequently, the present meta-analysis aims to quantify the overall effect of cbt on depressive symptoms in parents of children with special needs and to systematically examine potential moderators of treatment efficacy, including child diagnosis, intervention duration, and cultural context. this study seeks to provide evidence-based guidance for clinical practice and establish a theoretical and empirical foundation for developing individualized intervention strategies. materials and methods study design this study presents a systematic review of rcts conducted according to the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (prisma) guidelines [ 26 ]. before screening the search results, the protocol was registered with the international prospective register of systematic reviews (prospero; registration number: crd420251062465; registered april 2025). study inclusion criteria studies were included based on the following criteria: (1) randomized controlled trials that assessed the effectiveness of cbt for caregivers of children with special needs; (2) the intervention group received at least one session of structured cbt and was compared with a passive control (e.g., waitlist) or standard care/pharmacological treatment; (3) participants were primary caregivers of children with special needs, with no restrictions on gender, ethnicity, or socioeconomic status; (4) studies reported depression outcomes assessed using standardized measurement scales; and (5) studies were published in english with full-text availability. the exclusion criteria included: non-experimental studies (e.g., theoretical discussions, case reports), non-clinical studies (e.g., animal or cell-based research), secondary research (e.g., systematic reviews, meta-analyses), non-original publications (e.g., duplicate publications, conference abstracts), grey literature (e.g., unpublished or non-peer-reviewed reports), and studies employing unstructured interventions (e.g., single-session, non-standardized counseling). although systematic reviews were not eligible for inclusion, their reference lists were examined for additional studies that met the eligibility criteria. search strategy a comprehensive literature search was conducted across pubmed, web of science, scopus, psycinfo, and the cochrane library up to april 15, 2025. this search focused on rcts that evaluated the effects of cbt on depressive symptoms in parents of children with special needs, including conditions such as cerebral palsy, autism, and chronic illnesses. the search strategy was structured according to the picos framework: population (primary caregivers or parents of children with special needs), intervention (one or more sessions of structured cbt), comparison (no treatment, standard care, or usual treatment), outcome (depressive symptoms assessed using standardized scales, such as the beck depression inventory [bdi]), and study design (rcts). the search incorporated both free-text keywords and controlled vocabulary (e.g., mesh/emtree), and the complete search strategies for each database are provided in the supplementary document: retrieval strategy. in addition, reference tracking was employed as a supplementary method to enhance retrieval sensitivity.​​ the search terms included: (“cognitive behavioral therapy” or cbt) and (depression or depressive symptoms) and (parents or caregivers) and (“special needs children” or “chronic illness”) and (rct or “randomized controlled trial”). study selection process study selection adhered to the prisma guidelines. all retrieved records were imported into zotero 7.0 for automatic deduplication. title and abstract screening were conducted independently by two reviewers in a double-masked manner, excluding irrelevant studies. full texts of potentially eligible articles were retrieved and assessed for inclusion based on the picos criteria. discrepancies during the selection process were resolved through discussions with a third reviewer to minimize selection bias. data extraction was performed using a standardized form by two independent reviewers working in duplicate. key variables (e.g., sample characteristics, intervention details) were cross-checked, and disagreements were resolved through group discussions. data synthesis a meta-analysis was conducted using r software (version 4.3.1) with the meta, metafor, diamet, and ggplot2 packages. for continuous outcomes, either the mean difference (md) or the standardized mean difference (smd) was employed, depending on the consistency of the measurement tools. the smd was adjusted using hedges’ g, with thresholds defined as: g = 0.3 (small), 0.5 (moderate), and ≥ 0.8 (significant effect) [ 27 ]. the inverse-variance method was utilized to calculate pooled effect sizes. the primary analysis employed the dersimonian–laird random-effects model; fixed-effects models were also reported when heterogeneity was low (i 2 < 50%). heterogeneity was assessed using: (1) cochran’s q test (p < 0.10 considered significant); (2) the i 2 statistic (> 50% indicating high heterogeneity) [ 28 ]. publication bias was evaluated through funnel plots and egger’s regression test, with the trim-and-fill method applied to address asymmetry [ 29 ]. influential studies were identified using standardized residuals (|z|> 2.5) and cook’s distance (> 3 times the mean) [ 30 ]. sensitivity analyses included: (1) leave-one-out analysis using the metainf function; (2) meta-regression based on the restricted maximum likelihood (reml) method to examine potential moderators (e.g., intervention duration, population type), with results visualized using bubble plots [ 31 ]; (3) subgroup analyses to explore sources of heterogeneity. to standardize outcomes across different depression measures, data were converted using the hedges-olkin method: \({\text{smd}}=\frac{{m}_{\text{intervention}}-{m}_{\text{control}}}{{\text{sd}}_{\text{pooled}}},\hspace{1em}{\text{sd}}_{\text{pooled}}=\sqrt{\frac{{\left({n}_{1}-1\right){\text{sd}}}_{1}^{2}+{\left({n}_{2}-1\right){\text{sd}}}_{2}^{2}}{{n}_{1}+{n}_{2}-2}}\) [ 32 ]. risk of bias (quality) assessment the risk of bias was evaluated using the cochrane risk of bias 2 tool (rob2, 2019 version) [ 33 ], which encompasses the following domains: (1) bias arising from the randomization process; (2) deviations from intended interventions; (3) missing outcome data; (4) measurement of outcomes; and (5) selection of the reported results. assessments were performed independently by two reviewers in a blinded manner, with any disagreements resolved through discussions with a third reviewer. to enhance the transparency of evidence quality, evdmap ( https://www.pymeta.com/evdmap/ ) was used to visually summarize the distribution and quality of the included studies [ 34 ]. results study selection five hundred ninety-five records were retrieved from five databases, with 287 duplicates removed. after thoroughly screening the titles and abstracts of 203 articles, 54 were excluded because they failed to meet the inclusion criteria. the remaining 144 articles underwent a full-text review, excluding 131 based on predefined criteria (refer to fig. 1 for detailed exclusion reasons). ultimately, 13 studies were included in this systematic review [ 35 , 36 , 37 , 38 , 39 , 40 , 41 , 42 , 43 , 44 , 45 , 46 , 47 ]. fig. 1 flow diagram of the selection process. two of the 13 studies in the systematic review were excluded from the meta-analysis due to concerns about heterogeneity and bias full size image all rcts reported employing random allocation methods, providing detailed descriptions of sequence generation (e.g., computer-generated random numbers, random number tables) and allocation concealment (e.g., sealed envelopes). consequently, these studies were rated as having a low risk of bias due to randomization. however, due to cbt’s inherent nature, blinding participants and intervention providers was generally not feasible, which introduced a potential risk of bias stemming from deviations from the intended interventions. regarding data completeness, six studies reported attrition rates and employed intention-to-treat (itt) analyses [ 35 , 37 , 41 , 42 , 43 , 45 ], resulting in a low risk of bias due to missing outcome data. conversely, other studies did not adequately describe their handling of missing data, raising concerns. additionally, three studies failed to report pre-registration or a statistical analysis plan, which may lead to a potential risk of reporting bias [ 40 , 45 , 47 ]. figures 2 and 3 present a summary and evidence map of the risk of bias, respectively. fig. 2 risk of bias summary full size image fig. 3 evidence mapping of cognitive behavioral therapy interventions for depression full size image study characteristics this review encompasses 13 rcts conducted across various countries, including iran, the united states, and australia. the study population was predominantly comprised of mothers of children with special needs, with a few studies including both parents. the children’s conditions varied, encompassing autism spectrum disorder, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (adhd), cancer, obesity, and technology dependence. sample sizes differed significantly across studies, with intervention group sizes ranging from 6 to 100 participants and control group sizes from 6 to 157 participants. the ages of participating parents ranged from 17 to 75 years, with the majority falling within the 30–50 age range. all interventions were grounded in cbt, although some studies incorporated additional components such as problem-solving training (pst), acceptance and commitment therapy (act), or were delivered via online platforms. individual cbt sessions lasted between 45 and 120 min, typically administered on a weekly basis for 6 to 24 weeks. control conditions included waitlist controls, usual care, placebo controls, and active comparators (e.g., mother–child joint interventions). depressive symptoms were primarily evaluated using the depression, anxiety, and stress scales (dass) and the beck depression inventory (bdi), with some studies supplementing these measures with the general health questionnaire (ghq-28) and condition-specific cognitive assessment tools, such as the decisional conflict scale (dcs). as shown in table 1 . table 1 characteristics of the studies in the systematic review and meta-analysis​ full size table meta-analysis this study systematically evaluated the effects of cbt on depressive symptoms in parents of children with special needs. a total of 13 studies involving 1,441 parents were included in the analysis. given the substantial heterogeneity across studies (i 2 = 89.0%, p = 0.1077), a random-effects model was used. the pooled results indicated that cbt did not significantly affect parental depression (smd = –0.33, 95% ci: –0.72 to 0.07, p = 0.1077) (fig. 4 , left). due to the high heterogeneity (i 2 > 50%), egger’s regression test was conducted to assess potential publication bias. egger’s test, a method for detecting bias related to small-study effects in meta-analyses [ 48 ], did not show significant bias in the initial analysis (t = –1.112, p = 0.286), suggesting minimal influence from small-sample effects or data anomalies (fig. 5 a). however, two studies by zamani et al. (2019) and onyishi et al. (2023) reported extreme effect sizes (smd > 2), prompting a sensitivity analysis to explore their impact. sensitivity analysis, commonly used to assess the robustness of meta-analytic results [ 49 ], revealed that these two studies substantially influenced the overall smd (see supplementary file). standardized residuals (|z|> 2.5) and cook’s distance thresholds (> 3 × mean) were applied to identify outlier studies [ 50 ]. as shown in fig. 6 , onyishi et al. (2023) and zamani et al. (2019) deviated significantly from the distribution of other studies (left: residual plot; right: cook’s distance plot) and were identified as influential outliers. these studies were therefore excluded from further analysis. a repeated egger test still indicated no significant publication bias (t = –1.993, p = 0.0717) (fig. 5 b), and the trim-and-fill method suggested that while some risk of publication bias remained, it was not statistically significant. fig. 4 forest plot of the effect of cbt on depression in parents of children with special needs full size image fig. 5 funnel plots and egger’s regression test for publication bias full size image fig. 6 standardized residual and cook’s distance plots for outlier detection full size image after excluding the outliers, 11 studies involving 1235 parents were included in the final analysis. heterogeneity decreased (i 2 = 75.9%, p < 0.001), and a random-effects model was applied. the updated results showed a significant effect of cbt on reducing depressive symptoms in parents of children with special needs (smd = –0.24, 95% ci: –0.47 to 0.00, p = 0.046) (fig. 4 , right). subgroup analysis to further investigate the factors influencing the effectiveness of cbt, subgroup analyses were conducted based on child condition – categorized as parents of children with neurodevelopmental disorders (ndd; characterized by early-onset impairments in social, academic, or occupational functioning) [ 51 ], chronic illness (defined by conditions requiring long-term management) [ 52 ], or serious illness (involving life-threatening or severe health conditions) [ 53 ] – in addition to parent type, intervention modality, country/region, intervention duration, and session frequency. the parents’ age (30–40 years) and the frequency of intervention (once per week) exhibited minimal variation across the studies; thus, these variables were analyzed using meta-regression. subgroup analyses (fig. 7 ) revealed significant heterogeneity in the effects of cbt across various subgroups. at the participant level, seven studies focusing on parents of children with ndd demonstrated robust effects (smd = –0.45, 95% confidence interval [ci]: –0.69 to –0.21), with significant between-group differences (p for interaction = 0.001). methodologically, studies utilizing waitlist controls ( n = 7) exhibited substantial effects (smd = –0.45, 95% ci: –0.70 to –0.20), whereas studies employing active controls did not yield significant results (p for interaction = 0.039). regarding outcome measures, the most substantial effects were observed using the dass across four studies (smd = –0.65, 95% ci: –0.97 to –0.32), significantly outperforming the bdi and other assessment tools (p for interaction = 0.027). regarding intervention characteristics, two studies that included both parents reported significant effects (smd = –0.77, 95% ci: –1.22 to –0.32), superior to interventions involving only mothers (p for interaction = 0.019). subgroup analyses concerning dosage indicated borderline significance for interventions lasting 6–8 weeks (four studies; smd = –0.27, 95% ci: –0.54 to –0.00) and sessions of 45–60 min (five studies; smd = –0.32, 95% ci: –0.55 to –0.08), although between-group differences were not statistically significant (p for interaction > 0.05). notably, studies conducted in the united states ( n = 4, i 2 = 82.2%) and those with long-term follow-up ( n = 2, i 2 = 91.1%) exhibited high heterogeneity, necessitating cautious interpretation. the key findings suggest that cbt is most effective when targeting parents of children with ndd, utilizing waitlist controls, involving both parents, employing the dass, and delivering short-term, intensive interventions (6–8 weeks, 45–60 min per session). fig. 7 subgroup analysis of the effect of cbt on depression in parents of children with special needs full size image meta-regression analysis linear meta-regression analyses (fig. 8 ) revealed several factors that influence the effectiveness of cbt. the type of parent, determined by the child’s diagnosis, emerged as a significant positive predictor of effect size (β = 0.83, p = 0.000), indicating that the effectiveness of cbt varies considerably across different conditions. additionally, parental age showed a near-significant positive association (β = 0.04, p = 0.053), suggesting that older parents may derive greater benefits from cbt. conversely, other variables such as race (β = –0.54, p = 0.312), session duration (β = 0.04, p = 0.058), and measurement tool (β = –0.34, p = 0.297) did not achieve statistical significance. these findings underscore the need to tailor cbt strategies to match individual parent–child profiles. fig. 8 linear meta-regression bubble plot of the effect of cbt on depression in parents of children with special needs full size image nonlinear regression and dose–response analysis based on rigorously validated nonlinear regression and dose–response analyses (figs. 9 and 10 ), cognitive behavioral therapy exhibited significant characteristics in alleviating depressive symptoms among parents of children with special needs. the therapeutic effect peaked after a 6-week intervention duration, with an optimal session length of 45 min. the most favorable response was observed in parents with an average age of 37.9 years, and maximum treatment efficacy was achieved with a total intervention dose of 4 h (designated as ‘optimal: 4 h,’ smd ≈ −0.5). fig. 9 non-linear regression analysis of cbt effects on depression in parents of children with special needs full size image fig. 10 dose–response relationship between total cbt dosage and depression relief in parents of children with special needs full size image summary this meta-analysis included 13 trials with a total sample size of 1,441 participants. the initial random-effects model indicated no statistically significant effect of cbt on parental depression (smd = –0.33, 95% ci: –0.72 to 0.07, p = 0.11; i 2 = 89%). however, after excluding two outlier studies, the fixed-effects model demonstrated a significant benefit (smd = –0.24, 95% ci: –0.47 to 0.00, p = 0.046; i 2 = 75.9%). subgroup analyses revealed optimal effects among parents of children with neurodevelopmental disorders when cbt was administered alongside waitlist controls, involved both parents, utilized the depression anxiety stress scales (dass), and was conducted in short-term, intensive formats (6–8 weeks, 45–60 min per session). linear meta-regression analyses identified child diagnosis (β = 0.83, p = 0.000) and parental age (β = 0.04, p = 0.053) as significant moderators. nonlinear analyses revealed that the therapeutic effect peaked at a 6-week intervention duration and a 45-min session length. nonlinear regression further demonstrated optimal thresholds for intervention parameters: the maximum benefit (smd ≈ −0.5) was achieved with a total intervention dose of 4 h, particularly among parents aged 37.9 years, who exhibited the most significant improvement. these findings underscore the necessity for individualized adjustments to intervention protocols. discussion this meta-analysis revealed a complex pattern regarding the effects of cbt on depressive symptoms in parents of children with special needs. although the initial random-effects model did not demonstrate a significant impact (smd = –0.33, p = 0.11), a revised model excluding two extreme-effect studies confirmed a significant positive effect of cbt (smd = –0.24, p = 0.046). this discrepancy may have arisen from the high heterogeneity across studies (i 2 = 75.9%–89%), suggesting that sample characteristics and methodological variations substantially influenced intervention effects. although egger’s test did not indicate significant small-study bias in either the primary or sensitivity analyses, the possibility of publication bias cannot be entirely ruled out due to the small sample sizes in some subgroups and the potential existence of unpublished negative results or grey literature. this finding aligns with conclusions from previous systematic reviews, which indicate that while cbt can potentially improve parental mental health, its effectiveness is moderated by factors such as intervention design, measurement tools, and population characteristics [ 54 ]. subgroup analyses indicated that cbt was particularly effective in reducing depressive symptoms among parents of children with neurodevelopmental disorders, such as autism and adhd. these parents frequently encounter multiple stressors, including behavioral challenges, difficulties in social functioning, and long-term family dysfunction [ 12 ]. cbt effectively addressed their catastrophic thinking, such as the belief that ‘my child will never be independent’, and maladaptive coping strategies. consequently, cognitive restructuring techniques may have provided more substantial benefits for this demographic [ 41 ]. furthermore, cbt encouraged mindful parenting and the adoption of adaptive emotional regulation strategies, thereby enhancing parent–child relationships and overall family functioning [ 55 ]. through structured sessions, cbt also assisted parents in identifying and modifying negative thought patterns, which improved their coping skills and problem-solving abilities—essential components in managing the stress associated with raising children with neurodevelopmental conditions [ 41 ]. notably, subgroup analysis revealed that interventions involving both parents were more effective than those involving only one parent, thereby supporting the family systems theory, which emphasizes the importance of ‘joint coping’ mechanisms [ 43 , 46 ]. it is suggested that future studies prioritize the inclusion of fathers and other caregivers to enhance the generalizability of the conclusions. however, despite the advantages of joint participation, it is essential to consider family-specific circumstances and dynamics, as logistical challenges or unique situations may hinder dual-parent involvement. further subgroup analysis indicated that short-term, intensive interventions (6–8 weeks, 45–60 min per session) assessed using the dass scale were the most effective. the dass provided a multidimensional evaluation of depression, anxiety, and stress, thereby capturing the impact of cbt on complex psychological symptoms with greater sensitivity [ 56 ]. meta-regression analysis revealed that child diagnostic category (β = 0.83, p < 0.001) and parental age (β = 0.04, p = 0.053) were significant moderators. neuroplasticity has been proposed as a central mechanism underlying the efficacy of cbt, as it entails structural and functional changes in the brain following therapeutic intervention. research has demonstrated that cbt effectively reduces amygdala reactivity, which in turn leads to decreased anxiety and stress [ 57 ]. furthermore, parents engaged in child-focused cbt reported improvements in their mental health, suggesting that they may benefit indirectly through enhanced neuroplasticity and psychological well-being [ 58 ]. different diagnostic groups encounter distinct types of stress (e.g., treatment-related uncertainty in families dealing with cancer versus chronic behavioral management stress in families with autism), necessitating that cbt strategies be tailored accordingly [ 59 , 60 ]. nonlinear analyses revealed that the therapeutic effect peaked at a 6-week intervention duration and a 45-min session length. nonlinear regression further demonstrated optimal thresholds for intervention parameters: the maximum benefit (smd ≈ −0.5) was achieved with a total intervention dose of 4 h, particularly among parents aged 37.9 years, who exhibited the most significant improvement. these findings underscore the necessity for individualized adjustments to intervention protocols. the initial phase was designed to build therapeutic confidence through rapid symptom control, which was subsequently supported by sustained efforts to consolidate coping skills [ 61 ]. however, the potential economic burden of long-term interventions must be addressed [ 62 ]. future studies should consider integrating financial support modules and aligning with psychosocial care standards to develop interdisciplinary support systems that enhance the sustainability and generalizability of interventions. conclusion this study included 13 trials ( n = 1441). the initial random-effects model indicated that cbt did not significantly reduce depression in parents of children with special needs (smd = –0.33, 95% ci –0.72 to 0.07, p = 0.11; i 2 = 89%). however, after excluding two studies with extreme effects, a random-effects model revealed that cbt significantly alleviated depressive symptoms (smd = –0.24, 95% ci –0.47 to 0.00, p = 0.046; i 2 = 75.9%). subgroup analyses demonstrated that cbt was most effective for parents of children with neurodevelopmental disorders compared to waitlist controls, particularly in interventions involving both parents, utilizing the dass for assessment, and delivered in a concentrated format (6–8 weeks, 45–60 min per session). linear meta-regression analysis revealed that child diagnosis (β = 0.83, p < 0.001) and parental age (β = 0.04, p = 0.053) were significant moderators. nonlinear analyses revealed that the therapeutic effect peaked at a 6-week intervention duration and a 45-min session length. nonlinear regression further demonstrated optimal thresholds for intervention parameters: the maximum benefit (smd ≈ −0.5) was achieved with a total intervention dose of 4 h, particularly among parents aged 37.9 years, who exhibited the most significant improvement. these findings underscore the necessity for individualized adjustments to intervention protocols. limitations despite the rigorous methodological approach, several limitations must be acknowledged. first, the statistical heterogeneity across the included trials was high (i 2 up to 89%), likely reflecting variability in cbt protocols, participant characteristics (e.g., child diagnosis), control conditions, cultural contexts, measurement instruments, and study quality. we attempted to explore these sources through subgroup analyses, meta-regression, influence diagnostics, and sensitivity analyses; notably, the exclusion of two influential outliers reduced i 2 to 75.9%. however, substantial between-study variability remained, and pooled estimates should therefore be interpreted with caution. second, the predominance of mothers among participants limits the generalizability of the findings to fathers and other caregivers. notably, trials that involved both parents tended to report larger effects, highlighting the need for future studies to recruit more diverse caregiver samples. third, most trials reported only short-term outcomes, and evidence regarding the durability of cbt effects beyond six months is sparse, preventing firm conclusions about long-term sustainability. fourth, many studies lacked pre-registered analysis plans or trial registrations, raising the possibility of selective reporting bias. fifth, the dose–response and nonlinear analyses in this review are based on limited time-series data and should thus be considered exploratory until validated in larger, prospective dose-finding studies. additional limitations include potential language and database selection biases, inconsistent reporting of baseline depression severity across trials (which constrained moderator analyses), and the possibility of unpublished negative trials despite non-significant egger tests. collectively, these limitations underscore the need for larger, preregistered rcts with standardized interventions and outcome reporting, more extended follow-up periods, and more inclusive caregiver recruitment to clarify the effectiveness and optimal dosing of cbt in this population. data availability all data and materials can be accessed by contacting the first author. references brinkman tm,

a total of 13 rcts involving 1,441 parents were included. an initial random-effects model showed a slight, non-significant reduction in depressive symptoms (smd = –0.33, 95% ci [–0.72, 0.07]; i 2 = 89%). after excluding two outliers, a random-effects analysis indicated a significant effect (smd = –0.24, 95% ci [–0.47, 0.00], p = 0.046; i 2 = 75.9%). subgroup analyses revealed that cbt was most effective for parents of children with neurodevelopmental disorders (ndds), in trials using waitlist control groups, involving both parents, and when delivered over a short duration (6–8 weeks). meta-regression demonstrated that child diagnosis type (β = 0.83, p = 0.000) and parental age (β = 0.04, p = 0.053) were significant moderators. the optimal therapeutic effect was achieved at a total intervention dose of 4 h (smd ≈ -0.5), with parents aged 37.9 years demonstrating the most significant improvement, suggesting the necessity for individualized adjustment of the intervention protocol. conclusion cbt demonstrated a moderate and significant effect in alleviating depressive symptoms among parents of children with special needs, particularly in the context of ndds. this effect was most pronounced when interventions were implemented with moderate-to-high intensity, in a short-term format, and involved both parents. furthermore, tailoring interventions according to the child’s diagnosis and the total dosage of the intervention proved essential for optimizing outcomes. peer review reports introduction families of children with special needs—including those diagnosed with cancer, autism spectrum disorder (asd), developmental delays, or other chronic conditions—face a wide range of complex psychosocial challenges. research consistently indicates that parents experience considerable psychological distress during their child’s diagnosis, treatment, and long-term care, primarily manifesting as symptoms of depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder (ptsd) [ 1 , 2 ]. for instance, 29.8% of parents of children with congenital hyperinsulinism (chi) reported severe depressive symptoms [ 3 ]; in families of children with intellectual disabilities, 66.3% of mothers and 35.4% of fathers exhibited significant depressive symptoms [ 4 ]; among parents of children with asd, 26.7% received a clinical diagnosis of depression [ 5 ]. the severity of the child’s behavioral problems further exacerbates the psychological burden on parents. compared to fathers, primary caregivers—typically mothers—tend to report higher levels of depression, with mothers of children with intellectual disabilities and asd reporting more pronounced symptoms than fathers [ 4 ]. the roots of these psychological challenges can be traced to multiple sources of stress. from the perspective of the medical trauma stress model, children’s experiences with invasive treatments, uncertain prognoses, and repeated hospitalizations may elicit trauma responses among family members [ 6 , 7 ]. according to family systems theory, ‘illness management’—hereafter referred to more precisely as medical and long-term condition management (i.e., ongoing medical care, therapy regimens, and day-to-day caregiving tasks related to the condition)—disrupts familial role distributions, financial stability, and social networks, thereby increasing parental stress [ 8 , 9 ]. for instance, the high cost of medical care and specialized services imposes a substantial economic burden on families of children with chronic illnesses. at the same time, the lack of adequate professional support further exacerbates this burden [ 9 ]. furthermore, the challenge of balancing caregiving responsibilities with work and household obligations often results in sleep deprivation and diminished opportunities for parental self-care, ultimately exacerbating their mental health status [ 10 ]. cognitive behavioral therapy, characterized by its structured, goal-oriented, and skills-based framework, has been extensively utilized to enhance the psychological well-being of parents with children who have special needs. the fundamental mechanisms of cbt include: (1) cognitive restructuring, which mitigates negative thinking by challenging catastrophic cognitions (e.g., “i can’t cope with my child’s illness”) [ 11 ]; (2) behavioral activation, which bolsters coping efficacy through enhanced problem-solving skills [ 12 ]; and (3) family systems interventions, which foster understanding and collaboration among family members through improved communication and psychoeducation [ 13 ]. for parents of children with asd, chronic emotional stressors such as meltdowns and social impairments create an increased demand for sustained skills training [ 14 ]. conversely, parents of children recovering from cancer are often more impacted by acute medical trauma, including invasive treatments and fear of relapse. they may demonstrate stronger responses to cognitive restructuring strategies [ 15 ]. families of children with developmental delays frequently require financial stress management as part of the intervention due to significant economic constraints [ 16 ]. the adaptability of cbt facilitates individualized modifications based on the needs of parents and the developmental profile of the child [ 17 ]. despite promising advancements in the field, several issues and limitations persist. first, treatment efficacy appears to be heterogeneous; different child diagnoses significantly influence parental responsiveness to cbt. for instance, parents of children with asd may exhibit less favorable responses compared to those of children with cancer, potentially due to the cumulative effects of chronic stress [ 18 ]. second, evidence from long-term follow-up studies remains limited. some cohort studies have indicated a potential rebound in anxiety or depressive symptoms 3 to 5 years post-intervention [ 19 ]. emerging neurobiological and psychosocial studies provide complementary rationales for psychological interventions [ 20 , 21 , 22 , 23 , 24 , 25 ]. these studies suggest possible biological pathways and the importance of supportive care in mitigating caregiver distress, which we consider when interpreting cbt mechanisms and clinical implications. consequently, the present meta-analysis aims to quantify the overall effect of cbt on depressive symptoms in parents of children with special needs and to systematically examine potential moderators of treatment efficacy, including child diagnosis, intervention duration, and cultural context. this study seeks to provide evidence-based guidance for clinical practice and establish a theoretical and empirical foundation for developing individualized intervention strategies. materials and methods study design this study presents a systematic review of rcts conducted according to the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (prisma) guidelines [ 26 ]. before screening the search results, the protocol was registered with the international prospective register of systematic reviews (prospero; registration number: crd420251062465; registered april 2025). study inclusion criteria studies were included based on the following criteria: (1) randomized controlled trials that assessed the effectiveness of cbt for caregivers of children with special needs; (2) the intervention group received at least one session of structured cbt and was compared with a passive control (e.g., waitlist) or standard care/pharmacological treatment; (3) participants were primary caregivers of children with special needs, with no restrictions on gender, ethnicity, or socioeconomic status; (4) studies reported depression outcomes assessed using standardized measurement scales; and (5) studies were published in english with full-text availability. the exclusion criteria included: non-experimental studies (e.g., theoretical discussions, case reports), non-clinical studies (e.g., animal or cell-based research), secondary research (e.g., systematic reviews, meta-analyses), non-original publications (e.g., duplicate publications, conference abstracts), grey literature (e.g., unpublished or non-peer-reviewed reports), and studies employing unstructured interventions (e.g., single-session, non-standardized counseling). although systematic reviews were not eligible for inclusion, their reference lists were examined for additional studies that met the eligibility criteria. search strategy a comprehensive literature search was conducted across pubmed, web of science, scopus, psycinfo, and the cochrane library up to april 15, 2025. this search focused on rcts that evaluated the effects of cbt on depressive symptoms in parents of children with special needs, including conditions such as cerebral palsy, autism, and chronic illnesses. the search strategy was structured according to the picos framework: population (primary caregivers or parents of children with special needs), intervention (one or more sessions of structured cbt), comparison (no treatment, standard care, or usual treatment), outcome (depressive symptoms assessed using standardized scales, such as the beck depression inventory [bdi]), and study design (rcts). the search incorporated both free-text keywords and controlled vocabulary (e.g., mesh/emtree), and the complete search strategies for each database are provided in the supplementary document: retrieval strategy. in addition, reference tracking was employed as a supplementary method to enhance retrieval sensitivity.​​ the search terms included: (“cognitive behavioral therapy” or cbt) and (depression or depressive symptoms) and (parents or caregivers) and (“special needs children” or “chronic illness”) and (rct or “randomized controlled trial”). study selection process study selection adhered to the prisma guidelines. all retrieved records were imported into zotero 7.0 for automatic deduplication. title and abstract screening were conducted independently by two reviewers in a double-masked manner, excluding irrelevant studies. full texts of potentially eligible articles were retrieved and assessed for inclusion based on the picos criteria. discrepancies during the selection process were resolved through discussions with a third reviewer to minimize selection bias. data extraction was performed using a standardized form by two independent reviewers working in duplicate. key variables (e.g., sample characteristics, intervention details) were cross-checked, and disagreements were resolved through group discussions. data synthesis a meta-analysis was conducted using r software (version 4.3.1) with the meta, metafor, diamet, and ggplot2 packages. for continuous outcomes, either the mean difference (md) or the standardized mean difference (smd) was employed, depending on the consistency of the measurement tools. the smd was adjusted using hedges’ g, with thresholds defined as: g = 0.3 (small), 0.5 (moderate), and ≥ 0.8 (significant effect) [ 27 ]. the inverse-variance method was utilized to calculate pooled effect sizes. the primary analysis employed the dersimonian–laird random-effects model; fixed-effects models were also reported when heterogeneity was low (i 2 < 50%). heterogeneity was assessed using: (1) cochran’s q test (p < 0.10 considered significant); (2) the i 2 statistic (> 50% indicating high heterogeneity) [ 28 ]. publication bias was evaluated through funnel plots and egger’s regression test, with the trim-and-fill method applied to address asymmetry [ 29 ]. influential studies were identified using standardized residuals (|z|> 2.5) and cook’s distance (> 3 times the mean) [ 30 ]. sensitivity analyses included: (1) leave-one-out analysis using the metainf function; (2) meta-regression based on the restricted maximum likelihood (reml) method to examine potential moderators (e.g., intervention duration, population type), with results visualized using bubble plots [ 31 ]; (3) subgroup analyses to explore sources of heterogeneity. to standardize outcomes across different depression measures, data were converted using the hedges-olkin method: \({\text{smd}}=\frac{{m}_{\text{intervention}}-{m}_{\text{control}}}{{\text{sd}}_{\text{pooled}}},\hspace{1em}{\text{sd}}_{\text{pooled}}=\sqrt{\frac{{\left({n}_{1}-1\right){\text{sd}}}_{1}^{2}+{\left({n}_{2}-1\right){\text{sd}}}_{2}^{2}}{{n}_{1}+{n}_{2}-2}}\) [ 32 ]. risk of bias (quality) assessment the risk of bias was evaluated using the cochrane risk of bias 2 tool (rob2, 2019 version) [ 33 ], which encompasses the following domains: (1) bias arising from the randomization process; (2) deviations from intended interventions; (3) missing outcome data; (4) measurement of outcomes; and (5) selection of the reported results. assessments were performed independently by two reviewers in a blinded manner, with any disagreements resolved through discussions with a third reviewer. to enhance the transparency of evidence quality, evdmap ( https://www.pymeta.com/evdmap/ ) was used to visually summarize the distribution and quality of the included studies [ 34 ]. results study selection five hundred ninety-five records were retrieved from five databases, with 287 duplicates removed. after thoroughly screening the titles and abstracts of 203 articles, 54 were excluded because they failed to meet the inclusion criteria. the remaining 144 articles underwent a full-text review, excluding 131 based on predefined criteria (refer to fig. 1 for detailed exclusion reasons). ultimately, 13 studies were included in this systematic review [ 35 , 36 , 37 , 38 , 39 , 40 , 41 , 42 , 43 , 44 , 45 , 46 , 47 ]. fig. 1 flow diagram of the selection process. two of the 13 studies in the systematic review were excluded from the meta-analysis due to concerns about heterogeneity and bias full size image all rcts reported employing random allocation methods, providing detailed descriptions of sequence generation (e.g., computer-generated random numbers, random number tables) and allocation concealment (e.g., sealed envelopes). consequently, these studies were rated as having a low risk of bias due to randomization. however, due to cbt’s inherent nature, blinding participants and intervention providers was generally not feasible, which introduced a potential risk of bias stemming from deviations from the intended interventions. regarding data completeness, six studies reported attrition rates and employed intention-to-treat (itt) analyses [ 35 , 37 , 41 , 42 , 43 , 45 ], resulting in a low risk of bias due to missing outcome data. conversely, other studies did not adequately describe their handling of missing data, raising concerns. additionally, three studies failed to report pre-registration or a statistical analysis plan, which may lead to a potential risk of reporting bias [ 40 , 45 , 47 ]. figures 2 and 3 present a summary and evidence map of the risk of bias, respectively. fig. 2 risk of bias summary full size image fig. 3 evidence mapping of cognitive behavioral therapy interventions for depression full size image study characteristics this review encompasses 13 rcts conducted across various countries, including iran, the united states, and australia. the study population was predominantly comprised of mothers of children with special needs, with a few studies including both parents. the children’s conditions varied, encompassing autism spectrum disorder, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (adhd), cancer, obesity, and technology dependence. sample sizes differed significantly across studies, with intervention group sizes ranging from 6 to 100 participants and control group sizes from 6 to 157 participants. the ages of participating parents ranged from 17 to 75 years, with the majority falling within the 30–50 age range. all interventions were grounded in cbt, although some studies incorporated additional components such as problem-solving training (pst), acceptance and commitment therapy (act), or were delivered via online platforms. individual cbt sessions lasted between 45 and 120 min, typically administered on a weekly basis for 6 to 24 weeks. control conditions included waitlist controls, usual care, placebo controls, and active comparators (e.g., mother–child joint interventions). depressive symptoms were primarily evaluated using the depression, anxiety, and stress scales (dass) and the beck depression inventory (bdi), with some studies supplementing these measures with the general health questionnaire (ghq-28) and condition-specific cognitive assessment tools, such as the decisional conflict scale (dcs). as shown in table 1 . table 1 characteristics of the studies in the systematic review and meta-analysis​ full size table meta-analysis this study systematically evaluated the effects of cbt on depressive symptoms in parents of children with special needs. a total of 13 studies involving 1,441 parents were included in the analysis. given the substantial heterogeneity across studies (i 2 = 89.0%, p = 0.1077), a random-effects model was used. the pooled results indicated that cbt did not significantly affect parental depression (smd = –0.33, 95% ci: –0.72 to 0.07, p = 0.1077) (fig. 4 , left). due to the high heterogeneity (i 2 > 50%), egger’s regression test was conducted to assess potential publication bias. egger’s test, a method for detecting bias related to small-study effects in meta-analyses [ 48 ], did not show significant bias in the initial analysis (t = –1.112, p = 0.286), suggesting minimal influence from small-sample effects or data anomalies (fig. 5 a). however, two studies by zamani et al. (2019) and onyishi et al. (2023) reported extreme effect sizes (smd > 2), prompting a sensitivity analysis to explore their impact. sensitivity analysis, commonly used to assess the robustness of meta-analytic results [ 49 ], revealed that these two studies substantially influenced the overall smd (see supplementary file). standardized residuals (|z|> 2.5) and cook’s distance thresholds (> 3 × mean) were applied to identify outlier studies [ 50 ]. as shown in fig. 6 , onyishi et al. (2023) and zamani et al. (2019) deviated significantly from the distribution of other studies (left: residual plot; right: cook’s distance plot) and were identified as influential outliers. these studies were therefore excluded from further analysis. a repeated egger test still indicated no significant publication bias (t = –1.993, p = 0.0717) (fig. 5 b), and the trim-and-fill method suggested that while some risk of publication bias remained, it was not statistically significant. fig. 4 forest plot of the effect of cbt on depression in parents of children with special needs full size image fig. 5 funnel plots and egger’s regression test for publication bias full size image fig. 6 standardized residual and cook’s distance plots for outlier detection full size image after excluding the outliers, 11 studies involving 1235 parents were included in the final analysis. heterogeneity decreased (i 2 = 75.9%, p < 0.001), and a random-effects model was applied. the updated results showed a significant effect of cbt on reducing depressive symptoms in parents of children with special needs (smd = –0.24, 95% ci: –0.47 to 0.00, p = 0.046) (fig. 4 , right). subgroup analysis to further investigate the factors influencing the effectiveness of cbt, subgroup analyses were conducted based on child condition – categorized as parents of children with neurodevelopmental disorders (ndd; characterized by early-onset impairments in social, academic, or occupational functioning) [ 51 ], chronic illness (defined by conditions requiring long-term management) [ 52 ], or serious illness (involving life-threatening or severe health conditions) [ 53 ] – in addition to parent type, intervention modality, country/region, intervention duration, and session frequency. the parents’ age (30–40 years) and the frequency of intervention (once per week) exhibited minimal variation across the studies; thus, these variables were analyzed using meta-regression. subgroup analyses (fig. 7 ) revealed significant heterogeneity in the effects of cbt across various subgroups. at the participant level, seven studies focusing on parents of children with ndd demonstrated robust effects (smd = –0.45, 95% confidence interval [ci]: –0.69 to –0.21), with significant between-group differences (p for interaction = 0.001). methodologically, studies utilizing waitlist controls ( n = 7) exhibited substantial effects (smd = –0.45, 95% ci: –0.70 to –0.20), whereas studies employing active controls did not yield significant results (p for interaction = 0.039). regarding outcome measures, the most substantial effects were observed using the dass across four studies (smd = –0.65, 95% ci: –0.97 to –0.32), significantly outperforming the bdi and other assessment tools (p for interaction = 0.027). regarding intervention characteristics, two studies that included both parents reported significant effects (smd = –0.77, 95% ci: –1.22 to –0.32), superior to interventions involving only mothers (p for interaction = 0.019). subgroup analyses concerning dosage indicated borderline significance for interventions lasting 6–8 weeks (four studies; smd = –0.27, 95% ci: –0.54 to –0.00) and sessions of 45–60 min (five studies; smd = –0.32, 95% ci: –0.55 to –0.08), although between-group differences were not statistically significant (p for interaction > 0.05). notably, studies conducted in the united states ( n = 4, i 2 = 82.2%) and those with long-term follow-up ( n = 2, i 2 = 91.1%) exhibited high heterogeneity, necessitating cautious interpretation. the key findings suggest that cbt is most effective when targeting parents of children with ndd, utilizing waitlist controls, involving both parents, employing the dass, and delivering short-term, intensive interventions (6–8 weeks, 45–60 min per session). fig. 7 subgroup analysis of the effect of cbt on depression in parents of children with special needs full size image meta-regression analysis linear meta-regression analyses (fig. 8 ) revealed several factors that influence the effectiveness of cbt. the type of parent, determined by the child’s diagnosis, emerged as a significant positive predictor of effect size (β = 0.83, p = 0.000), indicating that the effectiveness of cbt varies considerably across different conditions. additionally, parental age showed a near-significant positive association (β = 0.04, p = 0.053), suggesting that older parents may derive greater benefits from cbt. conversely, other variables such as race (β = –0.54, p = 0.312), session duration (β = 0.04, p = 0.058), and measurement tool (β = –0.34, p = 0.297) did not achieve statistical significance. these findings underscore the need to tailor cbt strategies to match individual parent–child profiles. fig. 8 linear meta-regression bubble plot of the effect of cbt on depression in parents of children with special needs full size image nonlinear regression and dose–response analysis based on rigorously validated nonlinear regression and dose–response analyses (figs. 9 and 10 ), cognitive behavioral therapy exhibited significant characteristics in alleviating depressive symptoms among parents of children with special needs. the therapeutic effect peaked after a 6-week intervention duration, with an optimal session length of 45 min. the most favorable response was observed in parents with an average age of 37.9 years, and maximum treatment efficacy was achieved with a total intervention dose of 4 h (designated as ‘optimal: 4 h,’ smd ≈ −0.5). fig. 9 non-linear regression analysis of cbt effects on depression in parents of children with special needs full size image fig. 10 dose–response relationship between total cbt dosage and depression relief in parents of children with special needs full size image summary this meta-analysis included 13 trials with a total sample size of 1,441 participants. the initial random-effects model indicated no statistically significant effect of cbt on parental depression (smd = –0.33, 95% ci: –0.72 to 0.07, p = 0.11; i 2 = 89%). however, after excluding two outlier studies, the fixed-effects model demonstrated a significant benefit (smd = –0.24, 95% ci: –0.47 to 0.00, p = 0.046; i 2 = 75.9%). subgroup analyses revealed optimal effects among parents of children with neurodevelopmental disorders when cbt was administered alongside waitlist controls, involved both parents, utilized the depression anxiety stress scales (dass), and was conducted in short-term, intensive formats (6–8 weeks, 45–60 min per session). linear meta-regression analyses identified child diagnosis (β = 0.83, p = 0.000) and parental age (β = 0.04, p = 0.053) as significant moderators. nonlinear analyses revealed that the therapeutic effect peaked at a 6-week intervention duration and a 45-min session length. nonlinear regression further demonstrated optimal thresholds for intervention parameters: the maximum benefit (smd ≈ −0.5) was achieved with a total intervention dose of 4 h, particularly among parents aged 37.9 years, who exhibited the most significant improvement. these findings underscore the necessity for individualized adjustments to intervention protocols. discussion this meta-analysis revealed a complex pattern regarding the effects of cbt on depressive symptoms in parents of children with special needs. although the initial random-effects model did not demonstrate a significant impact (smd = –0.33, p = 0.11), a revised model excluding two extreme-effect studies confirmed a significant positive effect of cbt (smd = –0.24, p = 0.046). this discrepancy may have arisen from the high heterogeneity across studies (i 2 = 75.9%–89%), suggesting that sample characteristics and methodological variations substantially influenced intervention effects. although egger’s test did not indicate significant small-study bias in either the primary or sensitivity analyses, the possibility of publication bias cannot be entirely ruled out due to the small sample sizes in some subgroups and the potential existence of unpublished negative results or grey literature. this finding aligns with conclusions from previous systematic reviews, which indicate that while cbt can potentially improve parental mental health, its effectiveness is moderated by factors such as intervention design, measurement tools, and population characteristics [ 54 ]. subgroup analyses indicated that cbt was particularly effective in reducing depressive symptoms among parents of children with neurodevelopmental disorders, such as autism and adhd. these parents frequently encounter multiple stressors, including behavioral challenges, difficulties in social functioning, and long-term family dysfunction [ 12 ]. cbt effectively addressed their catastrophic thinking, such as the belief that ‘my child will never be independent’, and maladaptive coping strategies. consequently, cognitive restructuring techniques may have provided more substantial benefits for this demographic [ 41 ]. furthermore, cbt encouraged mindful parenting and the adoption of adaptive emotional regulation strategies, thereby enhancing parent–child relationships and overall family functioning [ 55 ]. through structured sessions, cbt also assisted parents in identifying and modifying negative thought patterns, which improved their coping skills and problem-solving abilities—essential components in managing the stress associated with raising children with neurodevelopmental conditions [ 41 ]. notably, subgroup analysis revealed that interventions involving both parents were more effective than those involving only one parent, thereby supporting the family systems theory, which emphasizes the importance of ‘joint coping’ mechanisms [ 43 , 46 ]. it is suggested that future studies prioritize the inclusion of fathers and other caregivers to enhance the generalizability of the conclusions. however, despite the advantages of joint participation, it is essential to consider family-specific circumstances and dynamics, as logistical challenges or unique situations may hinder dual-parent involvement. further subgroup analysis indicated that short-term, intensive interventions (6–8 weeks, 45–60 min per session) assessed using the dass scale were the most effective. the dass provided a multidimensional evaluation of depression, anxiety, and stress, thereby capturing the impact of cbt on complex psychological symptoms with greater sensitivity [ 56 ]. meta-regression analysis revealed that child diagnostic category (β = 0.83, p < 0.001) and parental age (β = 0.04, p = 0.053) were significant moderators. neuroplasticity has been proposed as a central mechanism underlying the efficacy of cbt, as it entails structural and functional changes in the brain following therapeutic intervention. research has demonstrated that cbt effectively reduces amygdala reactivity, which in turn leads to decreased anxiety and stress [ 57 ]. furthermore, parents engaged in child-focused cbt reported improvements in their mental health, suggesting that they may benefit indirectly through enhanced neuroplasticity and psychological well-being [ 58 ]. different diagnostic groups encounter distinct types of stress (e.g., treatment-related uncertainty in families dealing with cancer versus chronic behavioral management stress in families with autism), necessitating that cbt strategies be tailored accordingly [ 59 , 60 ]. nonlinear analyses revealed that the therapeutic effect peaked at a 6-week intervention duration and a 45-min session length. nonlinear regression further demonstrated optimal thresholds for intervention parameters: the maximum benefit (smd ≈ −0.5) was achieved with a total intervention dose of 4 h, particularly among parents aged 37.9 years, who exhibited the most significant improvement. these findings underscore the necessity for individualized adjustments to intervention protocols. the initial phase was designed to build therapeutic confidence through rapid symptom control, which was subsequently supported by sustained efforts to consolidate coping skills [ 61 ]. however, the potential economic burden of long-term interventions must be addressed [ 62 ]. future studies should consider integrating financial support modules and aligning with psychosocial care standards to develop interdisciplinary support systems that enhance the sustainability and generalizability of interventions. conclusion this study included 13 trials ( n = 1441). the initial random-effects model indicated that cbt did not significantly reduce depression in parents of children with special needs (smd = –0.33, 95% ci –0.72 to 0.07, p = 0.11; i 2 = 89%). however, after excluding two studies with extreme effects, a random-effects model revealed that cbt significantly alleviated depressive symptoms (smd = –0.24, 95% ci –0.47 to 0.00, p = 0.046; i 2 = 75.9%). subgroup analyses demonstrated that cbt was most effective for parents of children with neurodevelopmental disorders compared to waitlist controls, particularly in interventions involving both parents, utilizing the dass for assessment, and delivered in a concentrated format (6–8 weeks, 45–60 min per session). linear meta-regression analysis revealed that child diagnosis (β = 0.83, p < 0.001) and parental age (β = 0.04, p = 0.053) were significant moderators. nonlinear analyses revealed that the therapeutic effect peaked at a 6-week intervention duration and a 45-min session length. nonlinear regression further demonstrated optimal thresholds for intervention parameters: the maximum benefit (smd ≈ −0.5) was achieved with a total intervention dose of 4 h, particularly among parents aged 37.9 years, who exhibited the most significant improvement. these findings underscore the necessity for individualized adjustments to intervention protocols. limitations despite the rigorous methodological approach, several limitations must be acknowledged. first, the statistical heterogeneity across the included trials was high (i 2 up to 89%), likely reflecting variability in cbt protocols, participant characteristics (e.g., child diagnosis), control conditions, cultural contexts, measurement instruments, and study quality. we attempted to explore these sources through subgroup analyses, meta-regression, influence diagnostics, and sensitivity analyses; notably, the exclusion of two influential outliers reduced i 2 to 75.9%. however, substantial between-study variability remained, and pooled estimates should therefore be interpreted with caution. second, the predominance of mothers among participants limits the generalizability of the findings to fathers and other caregivers. notably, trials that involved both parents tended to report larger effects, highlighting the need for future studies to recruit more diverse caregiver samples. third, most trials reported only short-term outcomes, and evidence regarding the durability of cbt effects beyond six months is sparse, preventing firm conclusions about long-term sustainability. fourth, many studies lacked pre-registered analysis plans or trial registrations, raising the possibility of selective reporting bias. fifth, the dose–response and nonlinear analyses in this review are based on limited time-series data and should thus be considered exploratory until validated in larger, prospective dose-finding studies. additional limitations include potential language and database selection biases, inconsistent reporting of baseline depression severity across trials (which constrained moderator analyses), and the possibility of unpublished negative trials despite non-significant egger tests. collectively, these limitations underscore the need for larger, preregistered rcts with standardized interventions and outcome reporting, more extended follow-up periods, and more inclusive caregiver recruitment to clarify the effectiveness and optimal dosing of cbt in this population. data availability all data and materials can be accessed by contacting the first author. references brinkman tm,

this meta-analysis revealed a complex pattern regarding the effects of cbt on depressive symptoms in parents of children with special needs. although the initial random-effects model did not demonstrate a significant impact (smd = –0.33, p = 0.11), a revised model excluding two extreme-effect studies confirmed a significant positive effect of cbt (smd = –0.24, p = 0.046). this discrepancy may have arisen from the high heterogeneity across studies (i 2 = 75.9%–89%), suggesting that sample characteristics and methodological variations substantially influenced intervention effects. although egger’s test did not indicate significant small-study bias in either the primary or sensitivity analyses, the possibility of publication bias cannot be entirely ruled out due to the small sample sizes in some subgroups and the potential existence of unpublished negative results or grey literature. this finding aligns with conclusions from previous systematic reviews, which indicate that while cbt can potentially improve parental mental health, its effectiveness is moderated by factors such as intervention design, measurement tools, and population characteristics [ 54 ]. subgroup analyses indicated that cbt was particularly effective in reducing depressive symptoms among parents of children with neurodevelopmental disorders, such as autism and adhd. these parents frequently encounter multiple stressors, including behavioral challenges, difficulties in social functioning, and long-term family dysfunction [ 12 ]. cbt effectively addressed their catastrophic thinking, such as the belief that ‘my child will never be independent’, and maladaptive coping strategies. consequently, cognitive restructuring techniques may have provided more substantial benefits for this demographic [ 41 ]. furthermore, cbt encouraged mindful parenting and the adoption of adaptive emotional regulation strategies, thereby enhancing parent–child relationships and overall family functioning [ 55 ]. through structured sessions, cbt also assisted parents in identifying and modifying negative thought patterns, which improved their coping skills and problem-solving abilities—essential components in managing the stress associated with raising children with neurodevelopmental conditions [ 41 ]. notably, subgroup analysis revealed that interventions involving both parents were more effective than those involving only one parent, thereby supporting the family systems theory, which emphasizes the importance of ‘joint coping’ mechanisms [ 43 , 46 ]. it is suggested that future studies prioritize the inclusion of fathers and other caregivers to enhance the generalizability of the conclusions. however, despite the advantages of joint participation, it is essential to consider family-specific circumstances and dynamics, as logistical challenges or unique situations may hinder dual-parent involvement. further subgroup analysis indicated that short-term, intensive interventions (6–8 weeks, 45–60 min per session) assessed using the dass scale were the most effective. the dass provided a multidimensional evaluation of depression, anxiety, and stress, thereby capturing the impact of cbt on complex psychological symptoms with greater sensitivity [ 56 ]. meta-regression analysis revealed that child diagnostic category (β = 0.83, p < 0.001) and parental age (β = 0.04, p = 0.053) were significant moderators. neuroplasticity has been proposed as a central mechanism underlying the efficacy of cbt, as it entails structural and functional changes in the brain following therapeutic intervention. research has demonstrated that cbt effectively reduces amygdala reactivity, which in turn leads to decreased anxiety and stress [ 57 ]. furthermore, parents engaged in child-focused cbt reported improvements in their mental health, suggesting that they may benefit indirectly through enhanced neuroplasticity and psychological well-being [ 58 ]. different diagnostic groups encounter distinct types of stress (e.g., treatment-related uncertainty in families dealing with cancer versus chronic behavioral management stress in families with autism), necessitating that cbt strategies be tailored accordingly [ 59 , 60 ]. nonlinear analyses revealed that the therapeutic effect peaked at a 6-week intervention duration and a 45-min session length. nonlinear regression further demonstrated optimal thresholds for intervention parameters: the maximum benefit (smd ≈ −0.5) was achieved with a total intervention dose of 4 h, particularly among parents aged 37.9 years, who exhibited the most significant improvement. these findings underscore the necessity for individualized adjustments to intervention protocols. the initial phase was designed to build therapeutic confidence through rapid symptom control, which was subsequently supported by sustained efforts to consolidate coping skills [ 61 ]. however, the potential economic burden of long-term interventions must be addressed [ 62 ]. future studies should consider integrating financial support modules and aligning with psychosocial care standards to develop interdisciplinary support systems that enhance the sustainability and generalizability of interventions. conclusion this study included 13 trials ( n = 1441). the initial random-effects model indicated that cbt did not significantly reduce depression in parents of children with special needs (smd = –0.33, 95% ci –0.72 to 0.07, p = 0.11; i 2 = 89%). however, after excluding two studies with extreme effects, a random-effects model revealed that cbt significantly alleviated depressive symptoms (smd = –0.24, 95% ci –0.47 to 0.00, p = 0.046; i 2 = 75.9%). subgroup analyses demonstrated that cbt was most effective for parents of children with neurodevelopmental disorders compared to waitlist controls, particularly in interventions involving both parents, utilizing the dass for assessment, and delivered in a concentrated format (6–8 weeks, 45–60 min per session). linear meta-regression analysis revealed that child diagnosis (β = 0.83, p < 0.001) and parental age (β = 0.04, p = 0.053) were significant moderators. nonlinear analyses revealed that the therapeutic effect peaked at a 6-week intervention duration and a 45-min session length. nonlinear regression further demonstrated optimal thresholds for intervention parameters: the maximum benefit (smd ≈ −0.5) was achieved with a total intervention dose of 4 h, particularly among parents aged 37.9 years, who exhibited the most significant improvement. these findings underscore the necessity for individualized adjustments to intervention protocols. limitations despite the rigorous methodological approach, several limitations must be acknowledged. first, the statistical heterogeneity across the included trials was high (i 2 up to 89%), likely reflecting variability in cbt protocols, participant characteristics (e.g., child diagnosis), control conditions, cultural contexts, measurement instruments, and study quality. we attempted to explore these sources through subgroup analyses, meta-regression, influence diagnostics, and sensitivity analyses; notably, the exclusion of two influential outliers reduced i 2 to 75.9%. however, substantial between-study variability remained, and pooled estimates should therefore be interpreted with caution. second, the predominance of mothers among participants limits the generalizability of the findings to fathers and other caregivers. notably, trials that involved both parents tended to report larger effects, highlighting the need for future studies to recruit more diverse caregiver samples. third, most trials reported only short-term outcomes, and evidence regarding the durability of cbt effects beyond six months is sparse, preventing firm conclusions about long-term sustainability. fourth, many studies lacked pre-registered analysis plans or trial registrations, raising the possibility of selective reporting bias. fifth, the dose–response and nonlinear analyses in this review are based on limited time-series data and should thus be considered exploratory until validated in larger, prospective dose-finding studies. additional limitations include potential language and database selection biases, inconsistent reporting of baseline depression severity across trials (which constrained moderator analyses), and the possibility of unpublished negative trials despite non-significant egger tests. collectively, these limitations underscore the need for larger, preregistered rcts with standardized interventions and outcome reporting, more extended follow-up periods, and more inclusive caregiver recruitment to clarify the effectiveness and optimal dosing of cbt in this population. data availability all data and materials can be accessed by contacting the first author. references brinkman tm, recklitis cj, michel g, grootenhuis ma, klosky jl.
