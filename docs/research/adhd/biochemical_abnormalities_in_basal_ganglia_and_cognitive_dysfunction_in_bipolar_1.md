## Abstract

Bipolar Disorder (BD) comorbid with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) presents substantial diagnostic and therapeutic challenges, with notable cognitive dysfunction as a core characteristic. The neurobiological mechanisms underlying these cognitive impairments remain inadequately understood.
Cognitive performance was comprehensively assessed using the MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery (MCCB) among 90 adult participants categorized into three groups: pure BD (n = 26), BD comorbid with ADHD (n = 29), and healthy controls (n = 35). Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (
Patients with BD + ADHD demonstrated significant impairments across multiple cognitive domains compared to healthy controls. Regression analyses revealed ADHD severity significantly moderated the relationship between depressive symptoms, and both visual learning performance and overall composite performance. Metabolically, a significant reduction in choline/creatine (Cho/Cr) ratio was observed specifically in the right lentiform nucleus in the BD + ADHD group, correlating positively with visual learning ability.
