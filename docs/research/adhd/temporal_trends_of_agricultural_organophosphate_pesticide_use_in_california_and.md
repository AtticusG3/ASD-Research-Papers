## Abstract

Organophosphate (OP) pesticide exposure, particularly during the prenatal period, is linked to adverse neurodevelopmental impacts in children. One commonly used agricultural OP pesticide, chlorpyrifos, was severely restricted in California in 2020 but other OP pesticides continue to be used.
We calculated the absolute change in agricultural OP pesticide applications (by weight) in California before and after the chlorpyrifos ban (2016-2021) and investigated the spatial and demographic patterns of OP applications within 1 km of residences during pregnancy for all births in California in 2021. Geocoded residential addresses from 2021 California birth certificates were linked with publicly available records of pesticide applications within 1 km. Kilograms of OP pesticides applied during the estimated duration of the pregnancy were proportioned based on the area of intersection between the 1 km buffer zone and land-use polygons with crop data.
We found a 54% decrease in overall kilograms of OP pesticide use in California between 2016 and 2021 following the chlorpyrifos ban in 2020. Despite this decrease, we found that 7.5% of all pregnant people in California who gave birth in 2021 lived within 1 km of agricultural fields where OP pesticides had been used during their pregnancy; in one county, more than 50% of pregnant people lived within 1 km of OP pesticide use. There were considerable disparities by race/ethnicity, age, and region, with Hispanic/Latine, younger people, and residents of the predominantly fruit and vegetable growing Central Coast region being most likely to live near OP pesticide applications during pregnancy.
A high number of births statewide, particularly in high use counties, were to pregnant people who lived within 1 km of OP pesticide use at levels similar to those linked to adverse impacts for the child in epidemiologic studies. This suggests that regulatory changes to limit use or restrict applications in close proximity to residential areas could have a substantial public health benefit on children's brain development.

background organophosphate (op) pesticide exposure, particularly during the prenatal period, is linked to adverse neurodevelopmental impacts in children. one commonly used agricultural op pesticide, chlorpyrifos, was severely restricted in california in 2020 but other op pesticides continue to be used. methods we calculated the absolute change in agricultural op pesticide applications (by weight) in california before and after the chlorpyrifos ban (2016–2021) and investigated the spatial and demographic patterns of op applications within 1 km of residences during pregnancy for all births in california in 2021. geocoded residential addresses from 2021 california birth certificates were linked with publicly available records of pesticide applications within 1 km. kilograms of op pesticides applied during the estimated duration of the pregnancy were proportioned based on the area of intersection between the 1 km buffer zone and land-use polygons with crop data. results we found a 54% decrease in overall kilograms of op pesticide use in california between 2016 and 2021 following the chlorpyrifos ban in 2020. despite this decrease, we found that 7.5% of all pregnant people in california who gave birth in 2021 lived within 1 km of agricultural fields where op pesticides had been used during their pregnancy; in one county, more than 50% of pregnant people lived within 1 km of op pesticide use. there were considerable disparities by race/ethnicity, age, and region, with hispanic/latine, younger people, and residents of the predominantly fruit and vegetable growing central coast region being most likely to live near op pesticide applications during pregnancy. conclusions a high number of births statewide, particularly in high use counties, were to pregnant people who lived within 1 km of op pesticide use at levels similar to those linked to adverse impacts for the child in epidemiologic studies. this suggests that regulatory changes to limit use or restrict applications in close proximity to residential areas could have a substantial public health benefit on children’s brain development. peer review reports background organophosphate (op) pesticides are broad-spectrum insecticides widely used in agriculture, primarily on fruits, vegetables, grains, and fiber crops. op pesticides are neurotoxicants that inhibit the neurotransmitter acetylcholinesterase resulting in acute toxicity marked by muscle spasms, confusion, dizziness, loss of consciousness, seizures, abdominal cramps, vomiting, diarrhea, cessation of breathing, paralysis, and death in extreme cases [ 1 ]. early life exposure to some op pesticides has been linked to neurodevelopmental impacts including reduced iq, adhd, autism, change to brain morphology, and cerebral palsy, with the strongest associations found with exposures during pregnancy [ 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 ]. individual op pesticides have been banned or restricted in some jurisdictions, such as the european union, canada, and the state of california in the united states due to concerns about health risks to children. in california, after december 31, 2020, growers were no longer allowed to use or possess chlorpyrifos products (with the exception of a few granular products that were < 1% of total chlorpyrifos use) [ 8 ]. despite the elimination of these specific op pesticides, the use of organophosphates remains widespread in agricultural areas in the united states and california [ 1 , 9 ]. california is a major agricultural producer of fruits, nuts, vegetables and cotton, all of which are considered significant sites for op use [ 10 , 11 ]. farmworkers and agricultural communities have been identified as populations most likely to be exposed to op pesticides. potential routes of exposure include diet, occupational exposures (including take-home), and for those living close to fields with pesticide applications, pesticide drift can result in the contamination of air, water, and household dust [ 12 ]. residential proximity to pesticide applications—including the application of op pesticides— has been linked to increased levels of pesticide metabolites in urine and increased concentrations in household dust and ambient air at distances up to 4 km from applications [ 13 , 14 , 15 , 16 , 17 , 18 , 19 ]. multiple studies have found associations between residential proximity to total and individual op pesticide applications during pregnancy and adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes in children. for example, living within 2 km of chlorpyrifos, diazinon, and malathion applications during pregnancy has been associated with increased risk of autism spectrum disorder in children; [ 20 ] residence within 2 km of dimethoate applications during pregnancy has been associated to cerebral palsy in female births; [ 5 ] residence within 1 km of acephate and oxydemeton-methyl applications during pregnancy has been linked to reduced full scale iq; [ 4 ] and living within 1–1.25 km of total op pesticide applications during pregnancy has been linked to autism spectrum disorder, reduced iq in children, and altered brain activity in adolescents [ 4 , 21 , 22 ]. most of this research has been conducted in california, where all agricultural pesticide applications must be reported to the state, providing a unique opportunity for research. before the state of california’s chlorpyrifos ban, chlorpyrifos was the most widely used op pesticide in california. its use was highest in the central valley (85%) and frequently used on almond, alfalfa, walnut, orange, and cotton crops [ 23 ]. statewide assessments in california conducted before the ban found pronounced geographic variability and racial and ethnic disparities associated with residential proximity to the use of chlorpyrifos and other agricultural pesticides [ 23 , 24 ]. sources of these disparities include variations in growing regions, crops, climate, and land use patterns with respect to the racial/ethnic composition of impacted communities [ 23 , 25 ]. state and federal regulatory action has largely focused on chlorpyrifos in recent years, in part because of its predominant use amongst agricultural op pesticides. the california chlorpyrifos ban, which prohibited 99% of use, was proposed in march of 2019 and implemented in stages. an initial restriction of sales and distribution occurred between november 2019 and february 2020, and a ban on possession and use started on january 1, 2021. granular applications, reported as less than 1% of agricultural use in 2020, were exempted [ 8 , 26 ]. the us environmental protection agency (epa) is reviewing the op class of pesticides and is projected to make regulatory determinations for individual pesticides and a cumulative assessment of the risk from combined exposure to the entire class before october 2026 [ 27 ]. additional assessments of non-chlorpyrifos op pesticides have not been announced in california, nor have there been studies evaluating replacement pest control practices. although multiple scientific reviews have found evidence of developmental neurotoxicity for individual op pesticides and combined op pesticide exposures, there remains considerable variability in the consideration of developmental neurotoxicity in regulatory assessments among countries and within the united states [ 2 , 7 , 12 ]. because of the public health significance of the op class of pesticides, it is important to examine and characterize the continued use and distribution of op pesticide use in the state following the cancellation of chlorpyrifos, especially in proximity to vulnerable populations, such as pregnant people. the distribution and potential impact of op pesticide use in agriculture since the cancellation of chlorpyrifos has not previously been described. we investigated changes in agricultural op pesticide use in california before and after the chlorpyrifos ban and we assessed the spatial and demographic patterns of op pesticide use in proximity to the residences (within 1 km) of pregnant people who gave birth in 2021– the year after the ban was in effect. methods data sources agricultural op pesticide use was collected from the california department of pesticide regulation’s (cdpr) pesticide use reporting (pur) program for all organophosphate pesticides reported in 2016 and/or 2021: acephate, bensulide, chlorpyrifos, diazinon, dichlorvos, dimethoate, disulfoton, ethoprop, fenthion, malathion, methidathion, methyl-parathion, mevinphos, naled, oxydemeton-methyl, phorate, phosmet, tetrachlorvinphos, tribufos and trichlorfon [ 28 ]. data for op pesticide applications statewide, by region (see supplemental table 1 for region descriptions) and by county, were examined for 2016 (4 years prior to the chlorpyrifos cancellation in 2020) and 2021 (the first year where possession and use of 99% of uses were prohibited) [ 8 ]. this time period was chosen to capture op pesticide use before california began the reevaluation of chlorpyrifos in 2017 and a sufficient interval to avoid year-to-year variability which cdpr attributes to weather and changes in cultivation patterns [ 29 , 30 ]. only reports of op pesticide use with a valid location (which identifies the 1.6 × 1.6 km section defined by the public land survey system (plss)), application date, agricultural site, amount of active ingredient in the applied pesticide product, and acres treated were included. agricultural site records for op pesticides applications in the 2021 pur provided information on crops and cultivation patterns. to further refine the location of op pesticide applications from the pur data, the california department of water resources (dwr) 2020 crop mapping dataset was used to identify individual polygons with agricultural land uses within the plss section [ 31 ]. applications of op pesticides were spatially linked to the dwr land use maps through crop type information to more accurately identify where the pesticides were likely applied. birth records from january 1 st - december 31 st, 2021 were collected from the california department of public health’s center for health statistics and informatics birth statistical master file [ 32 ]. information on the date of birth and pregnant person’s address, age, and race/ethnicity at the time of birth were included. residential addresses of pregnant persons were deduplicated for those with multiple births, cleaned, and geocoded, resulting in residential addresses for 390,633 births (93.7% of total births in 2021). this protocol was reviewed, and the need for consent to participate was waived, by the california health and human service agency’s committee for the protection of human subjects in accordance with the us federal policy for the protection of human subjects (the “common rule”). assessment of nearby op use during pregnancy applications of op pesticide use near each pregnant person’s residence were assigned based on temporal (approximate length of pregnancy) and spatial estimates (a one-kilometer buffer zone around the home). the time window of nearby pesticide applications for each pregnancy was determined based on the estimated date of conception through the delivery date. all pregnancies were treated as 40 weeks long when calculating the date of conception and address on the birth record was assumed to reflect residence throughout the entire pregnancy. the 1 km buffer zone around the residence was chosen to be consistent with a cohort study which found associations between op applications within 1 km of maternal address during pregnancy and reduced iq in the children, and is a distance commonly used in other epidemiologic proximity studies in california [ 4 ]. to spatially refine the pur records of op pesticide applications, each application record was matched to one or more land-use polygons from the california department of water resources (dwr) 2020 crop mapping dataset. this method, described by rull and ritz (2003) and used in other studies examining proximity to agricultural pesticide use, links the plss and site locations listed in the pesticide use reports to specific land-use polygons and crop types (defined by dwr to classify land use) through a tiered matching system [ 33 , 34 ]. if multiple polygons with the same crop type were co-located within a plss section, then the related application from the pur database was apportioned among those fields, assuming that pesticides were applied at the same rate across the entire application area. for pur applications that could not be linked to the dwr land-use polygon level, the op pesticide applications were apportioned across the entire plss section. the kilograms of op pesticides applied near each pregnant person’s residence were calculated based on the proportion of intersection between the 1 km buffer zone around the geocoded point and the dwr land-use polygons (or plss section if polygons could not be linked). for example, if 20% of the land-use polygon area fell within the 1 km buffer zone, 20% of the total kilograms of op pesticide applications would be assigned to the pregnant person’s residence. the proportional amount of individual and cumulative op pesticides applied during the estimated time frame of each pregnancy within the area of intersection were summed. we performed chi-squared tests to assess differences between the race/ethnicity and age groups among the number of pregnant people with op pesticide use within 1 km of their residence and kruskal-wallis tests for the median kilograms of op pesticides applied nearby. applications of op pesticide use near each pregnant person’s residence were aggregated by county and region to assess patterns of use across california and to avoid disclosure of individual births in geographic areas with low counts as per california department of health care services data de-identification guidelines. results there was a 54% reduction in statewide agricultural op pesticide use from 2016 to 2021 (fig. 1 ), from 1,001,104 kg to 464,686 kg (p-value < 0.001). in 2016, chlorpyrifos accounted for 41% of all op pesticide applications (by weight), compared to 1% in 2021. use of chlorpyrifos decreased from 408,295 kg in 2016 to 2,769 kg in 2021 ( p -value = 0.002). although chlorpyrifos accounted for 59% of the total reduction in op pesticide use, there were also decreases in applications of most other op pesticides over this time period. use decreased significantly for acephate (68,487 kg to 48,639 kg, p -value = 0.01), dimethoate (110,113 kg to 41,802 kg, p -value < 0.001), malathion (141,840 kg to 108,179 kg, p -value = 0.04), and oxydemeton-methyl (1,707 kg to 0.01 kg, p -value = 0.002). bensulide was the only op pesticide that appeared to increase in total statewide usage by weight from 2016 to 2021, but it was not statistically significant (p-value 0.3). fig. 1 agricultural organophosphate pesticide use (kg) before (2016) and after (2021) the cancellation of chlorpyrifos (2020) * includes fenthion, dichlorvos, disulfoton, tetrachlorvinphos, and mevinphos (2016); trichlorfon (2021); methyl-parathion, methidathion, ethoprop, oxydemeton-methyl, tribufos, phorate, and phosmet (2016 and 2021) full size image comparison of op pesticide use between regions is difficult because regions differ widely in area, arable land, climate and population density. however, temporal changes in agricultural op pesticide use between 2016 and 2021 varied by growing region and county in california (table 1 ). in 2016, the san joaquin valley region used the largest amount of agricultural op pesticides (605,116 kg). op pesticide use in the san joaquin valley reduced 73.9% from 2016 to 2021 following the cancellation of chlorpyrifos, with the largest reduction in kern county (−87%). large reductions in op pesticide use were also seen in most other regions of california, ranging from − 30.7% to −76.0%. only the central coast region measured an increase (+ 0.5%) in agricultural op use during this time. two of the five counties in the central coast region reported an increase in total agricultural op pesticide use from 2016 to 2021: monterey county (+ 26%) and santa barbara county (+ 4%) (see supplemental table 2). in 2021, the areas with the highest intensity of op pesticide use were in monterey county and santa barbara county (central coast), imperial county (southern california), and kings county (san joaquin valley). the op pesticide use in these counties was highly concentrated with areas reporting an intensity of 6250–13,550 kg per township (9.6 × 9.6 km) (fig. 2 ). table 1 agricultural op pesticide use (kg) by california growing region before and after the cancellation of chlorpyrifos full size table fig. 2 op pesticide applications in 2021 full size image although bensulide was the most heavily applied organophosphate (by weight) in california in 2021, acephate and malathion were the most frequently used within 1 km of homes during pregnancy (table 2 ). in total, 29,386 pregnant people (7.5% of all 2021 births in california) lived within 1 km of op use over the course of the pregnancy (use occurred in 2020 and/or 2021 depending on the timing of the birth). the number of different op pesticides used within 1 km of a pregnant person’s home during gestation ranged from 1 to 6. chlorpyrifos was used within 1 km of homes for 3% of the pregnant people with residences within 1 km of op use, representing use that occurred in 2020 during the phase-down and a small amount of reported use in 2021. table 2 percent a of california births in 2021 with op pesticide applications within 1 km of residence during pregnancy, by chemical and region full size table agricultural op pesticide use near pregnant people’s residence differed statewide by race/ethnicity and age groups (table 3 ). hispanic/latine had the highest number (17,579 persons) and greatest proportion of population (10%) and were more likely to live within 1 km of op pesticide use during pregnancy compared to non-hispanic whites (p-value < 0.0001). hispanic/latine people also experienced the largest amount of median op pesticide use within 1 km of residence during pregnancy on average (3.30 kg). younger pregnant people experienced a higher median weight of op use within 1 km of residence during pregnancy and were more likely to live within 1 km of op pesticide use during pregnancy compared to those age 30–34 (p-value < 0.0001). table 3 residence within 1 km of op pesticide use during pregnancy by race/ethnicity and age (all california births in 2021, n = 390,633) full size table the proportion of pregnant people with op pesticide use within 1 km of residence during pregnancy varied by growing region and county (fig. 3 ). in 9 counties, greater than 1 in 5 pregnant people (> 20%) experienced op applications within 1 km of their residence (table 4 ). the majority of these counties are in the central coast region of california; in this region, the median op pesticide use within 1 km of residence during pregnancy ranged from 14 to 69 kg, compared to 2 kg statewide among those with nearby op pesticide use. pregnant people in monterey county experienced the highest use of op pesticides within 1 km of their residence during pregnancy (25th percentile = 17 kg; 75th percentile = 168 kg). monterey county also had the highest proportion of pregnant people (50%) with op pesticide use within 1 km of their residence during pregnancy. fig. 3 percent of pregnancies with op application(s) within 1 km of residence, by county and region full size image table 4

bensulide, malathion, and naled were the op pesticides applied the most (by weight) within 1 km of pregnant people’s residence (table 5 ). bensulide had the highest geometric mean by weight (kg), and the highest percentile usage within 1 km of residence during pregnancy (25th percentile = 11 kg; 75th percentile = 2399 kg). the geometric mean for all op pesticide applications within 1 km of residence during pregnancy in monterey county was 42 kg. the mean number of op pesticides used within 1 km of residence during pregnancy was 3 and the maximum was 6. table 5 monterey county op pesticide use (kg) and quartile of usage (kg) within 1 km of residence during pregnancy in 2021 full size table overall, the top five op pesticides applied in the greatest quantity (by weight) in monterey county were bensulide (77,553 kg), acephate (13,263 kg), malathion (12,037 kg), naled (9717 kg), and dimethoate (1938 kg). in monterey county, and in other central coast counties, these pesticides are used predominantly on lettuce, strawberries, and cole crops (e.g. cabbage, broccoli, brussels sprouts). in contrast, crops cultivated with op pesticide use in sutter, merced and tulare counties (that are geographically located in the sacramento and san joaquin valley, together considered the central valley) were tree nuts and citrus; crops cultivated with op pesticide use in imperial county (in the southern part of the state) were more variable. (see supplemental table 3). racial/ethnic disparities in residential proximity to op use in monterey county are consistent with statewide trends, though the proportions of impacted pregnant people are larger in monterey county (not shown). proportionally, five-fold more hispanic/latine pregnant persons lived within 1 km of op pesticide use in monterey county (57%) compared to hispanic/latine pregnant persons statewide (10%). similar to statewide trends, a greater proportion of younger pregnant persons in monterey resided within 1 km of op pesticide use during pregnancy. discussion we found a 54% decrease in overall kilograms of agricultural op pesticide use in california between 2016 and 2021, following the statewide chlorpyrifos ban in 2020. despite this decrease, we found that 7.5% of all pregnant people in california who gave birth in 2021 lived within 1 km of agricultural fields where op pesticides had been used during their pregnancy. in one california county, more than 50% of pregnant people lived within 1 km of op pesticide use. there were considerable disparities by race/ethnicity, age, and region; hispanic/latine, younger people, and residents of the predominantly fruit and vegetable growing central coast region were the most likely to live near op pesticide applications during pregnancy. this region was also the only area where op pesticide use did not decrease from 2016 to 2021. this study is the first to use available data sources to quantify and describe populations vulnerable to adverse health outcomes based on residential proximity to agricultural applications of op pesticides since the cancellation of chlorpyrifos. our finding that 7.5% of pregnancies in 2021 were within 1 km of op pesticide applications is consistent with other california studies documenting the proximity of agricultural applications of pesticides to residential communities [ 4 , 5 , 15 , 23 ]. of the nine counties with the highest fraction of births in proximity to op pesticide use, five (monterey, tulare, merced, imperial, ventura) were in the top 10 agricultural counties in terms of revenue in 2021 and eight were in the top 25 [ 25 ]. total reductions in op pesticide use observed at the state level were not observed in all regions and counties in california. chlorpyrifos was the most widely used op pesticide in many counties in the san joaquin valley in 2016. after the ban on chlorpyrifos, op pesticide use decreased significantly in these counties, and the region with the highest op pesticide use shifted from the san joaquin valley to the central coast. the central coast region did not experience the large reductions in total op pesticide use seen in other growing regions in the state, likely because this region has a different crop mix with lower historical use of chlorpyrifos compared to the san joaquin valley [ 23 ]. as a result, the potential public health benefits from reductions in total op pesticide use following the cancellation of chlorpyrifos are unlikely to be shared across the state. our results show a concentration of op pesticide use in the central coast region overall and within proximity to the homes of pregnant people. some common cultivation patterns may be driving the concentration of op pesticide use in central coast counties. lettuce cultivation was a major user of op pesticides in the counties with the highest op pesticide use and, of the counties where lettuce was reported as a leading commodity in the 2021 agricultural statistics, all but one (imperial) are located in the central coast. notably all of the major lettuce producing counties, including imperial, were among the top counties in terms of op pesticide use near pregnancies [ 25 ]. similarly, strawberry and cole crop (broccoli, cabbage, cauliflower, and brussels sprouts) cultivation are concentrated in central coast counties. lettuce, strawberries, and cole crops are labor intensive, resulting in large populations living in close proximity to fields. in contrast, the central valley of california, which includes the sacramento and san joaquin valley growing regions, op pesticide applications were historically dominated by chlorpyrifos use on tree nuts and citrus [ 23 ]. overall, in these regions, chlorpyrifos applications do not seem to have been replaced by large increases in applications of other op pesticides. however, we did identify three counties, sutter, merced, and tulare, with a higher percentage of pregnant people living near op pesticide applications. in two of these counties, op pesticide use is predominantly on citrus and tree nuts which is similar to the historical drivers of chlorpyrifos use in the region. further investigation is warranted to determine if the use of op pesticides near pregnant people in these counties compared to neighboring counties stems from differing pest control practices or land use patterns. linkage of op pesticide application data with birth records revealed novel findings that differ from just examining the application data on its own. although bensulide was the op pesticides with the greatest total use by weight in the state in 2021, acephate and malathion were used more frequently in proximity to the homes of pregnant people in our analysis. we also found geographic areas of very high intensity of aggregate op pesticide use within 1 km of pregnant people. this could be the result of differential application frequencies and rates between the pesticides and/or differences in land use patterns where housing is in close proximity to multiple agricultural fields. our finding that a large number of pregnant people in california live in homes that are close to op pesticide applications is of public health concern. in a study conducted in monterey county, residential proximity within 1 km of op pesticide use during pregnancy was associated with lower iq in children, with one standard deviation increase in total op pesticide use near the home (237 kg) being associated with a 2-point decrease (15% of a standard deviation) in full scale iq at age 7 [ 4 ]. we found that more than half of all pregnant people in monterey county lived within 1 km of op pesticide use, suggesting that a large population may be at increased risk of iq decrements, autism, or other adverse neurodevelopmental impacts [ 20 , 21 ]. we found an increased likelihood for pregnant people identifying as hispanic/latine to reside near op pesticide applications and to reside near greater amounts of op pesticide applications, which is consistent with other analyses of racial/ethnic disparities in pesticide exposures [ 23 , 24 , 35 ]. racial/ethnic disparities in op pesticide exposures for pregnant people identifying as hispanic/latine were higher in monterey county than the state overall. our study also identified young pregnant people under the age of 20 as a population potentially more exposed to op pesticides during pregnancy, which may compound other pregnancy vulnerabilities for this age group [ 36 ]. our findings add to a larger body of research documenting exposure disparities that may contribute to racial and ethnic health disparities for children [ 35 ]. the analysis of chlorpyrifos use patterns before and after the ban provides some suggestive evidence of the impact of the ban on op exposures during pregnancy. pesticide use data on chlorpyrifos applications in 2015 (pre-ban) found chlorpyrifos use highly concentrated in the san joaquin valley and positively associated with population density, suggesting the potential for residential proximity to chlorpyrifos applications [ 23 ]. combined with our finding of a large decrease in op pesticide use in the san joaquin valley after the ban, there’s evidence that, in some regions of california, the ban likely decreased the likelihood of pregnant people living in proximity to chlorpyrifos applications. unfortunately, we were not able to compare pregnancies in 2016 to 2021, so direct quantitative comparison of op pesticide use in proximity to pregnancies before and after the chlorpyrifos ban is beyond the scope of this study. our study is limited by the accuracy of the data sets we relied upon. there may be errors in the pesticide application data reported to the state of california in the publicly available pur files. however, reporting of pesticide applications is required of all agricultural growers, enforced by county agricultural commissioners, and undergoes extensive quality control checks prior to public release [ 37 ]. not all op pesticides have equal toxicity. relative potency factors are available that compare acetylcholinesterase inhibition across the individual op pesticides [ 38 ]. using these potency factors, several of the ops currently used in high amounts in california are more potent than chlorpyrifos (acephate, dimethoate and naled) and others are less potent (bensulide and malathion) making it difficult to assess how use of other ops has impacted the overall toxicity. there is also uncertainty as to whether potency for acetylcholinesterase inhibition is predictive of developmental neurotoxicity [ 12 ]. in addition, according to the california pesticide use reporting (pur) reporting, 72.1% of the kilograms of op pesticides were applied by ground and 22.6% were applied by air [ 39 ]. although aerial applications are likely to result in increased exposure due to drift, some ground based application methods such as canon or airblast orchard sprayers also increase off site drift [ 40 ]. as a result, accurately accounting for spray drift based on the application method was not possible using the pur data. there may be inaccuracy in our findings stemming from errors in the data reported on birth certificates for 2021 births, but these errors are assumed to affect only a small number of records. there is also possible misclassification error stemming from our assumptions that the address reported on the birth certificate corresponds to the residence during the entire pregnancy [ 41 ]. moves during pregnancy could occur both within the 1 km buffer distance or outside of it, resulting in either under- or over-estimation of the number of pregnancies potentially exposed to op pesticide applications and the amount (in kilograms) of op pesticides applied. overestimation could occur if pregnancies of shorter duration were linked to agricultural applications that only happened in the latter weeks of pregnancy, which seems unlikely to have a large impact on our findings. seasonality of op pesticide applications could account for some differences seen in the kilograms of applications occurring near individual residences; however, this is not likely to impact county and regional differences assuming births are distributed evenly throughout the year. the magnitude of people potentially exposed to op pesticides during pregnancy in california is likely underestimated because we only captured potential exposures occurring as a result of pesticide drift into the home from neighboring fields. op pesticide applications near workplaces, schools, or other areas in the community are also sources of potential exposure for pregnant people, regardless of their home address. additionally, pregnant people in agricultural communities may be exposed to op pesticide applications while working in the fields or as a result of op pesticide residues brought home by other agricultural workers living in the home [ 42 ]. our use of birth record data to identify pregnancies likely undercounts the total number and proportion of pregnancies with residential proximity to op pesticide applications because of the exclusion of spontaneous abortions and stillbirths which have been found to be associated with proximity to agricultural op use [ 43 ]. our analyses show that op pesticide use decreased dramatically in many california counties with the cancelling of chlorpyrifos, particularly in the nut tree and citrus-dominated central valley. however, op use and residential proximity remains high in the central coast region with lettuce, cole crop, and strawberry cultivation. our findings suggest that agricultural transition to non-chemical production and/or pesticides that are not reproductive toxicants could reduce adverse prenatal exposures for a large population in the central coast region of california. conclusions regulatory restriction and phase-out of most uses of chlorpyrifos reduced the potential for op pesticide exposures during pregnancy in some parts of the state, but hot-spots for agricultural op pesticide use remain. the high number of births statewide, particularly in high-use counties, to pregnant people who lived within 1 km of op pesticide use at levels similar to those linked to adverse impacts for the child in epidemiologic studies suggests that regulatory changes to limit the use of or restrict applications in close proximity to residential areas (buffer zones) could have a substantial public health benefit [ 44 ]. additionally, the use of op pesticides in proximity to pregnancies included multiple op chemistries, and our study found many pregnancies were in proximity to more than one op pesticide application. current regulatory practices in california to assess health threats from each individual pesticide may not accurately capture potential impacts of exposure to multiple pesticides with similar adverse health endpoints. data availability the birth certificate dataset

background organophosphate (op) pesticide exposure, particularly during the prenatal period, is linked to adverse neurodevelopmental impacts in children. one commonly used agricultural op pesticide, chlorpyrifos, was severely restricted in california in 2020 but other op pesticides continue to be used. methods we calculated the absolute change in agricultural op pesticide applications (by weight) in california before and after the chlorpyrifos ban (2016–2021) and investigated the spatial and demographic patterns of op applications within 1 km of residences during pregnancy for all births in california in 2021. geocoded residential addresses from 2021 california birth certificates were linked with publicly available records of pesticide applications within 1 km. kilograms of op pesticides applied during the estimated duration of the pregnancy were proportioned based on the area of intersection between the 1 km buffer zone and land-use polygons with crop data. results we found a 54% decrease in overall kilograms of op pesticide use in california between 2016 and 2021 following the chlorpyrifos ban in 2020. despite this decrease, we found that 7.5% of all pregnant people in california who gave birth in 2021 lived within 1 km of agricultural fields where op pesticides had been used during their pregnancy; in one county, more than 50% of pregnant people lived within 1 km of op pesticide use. there were considerable disparities by race/ethnicity, age, and region, with hispanic/latine, younger people, and residents of the predominantly fruit and vegetable growing central coast region being most likely to live near op pesticide applications during pregnancy. conclusions a high number of births statewide, particularly in high use counties, were to pregnant people who lived within 1 km of op pesticide use at levels similar to those linked to adverse impacts for the child in epidemiologic studies. this suggests that regulatory changes to limit use or restrict applications in close proximity to residential areas could have a substantial public health benefit on children’s brain development. peer review reports background organophosphate (op) pesticides are broad-spectrum insecticides widely used in agriculture, primarily on fruits, vegetables, grains, and fiber crops. op pesticides are neurotoxicants that inhibit the neurotransmitter acetylcholinesterase resulting in acute toxicity marked by muscle spasms, confusion, dizziness, loss of consciousness, seizures, abdominal cramps, vomiting, diarrhea, cessation of breathing, paralysis, and death in extreme cases [ 1 ]. early life exposure to some op pesticides has been linked to neurodevelopmental impacts including reduced iq, adhd, autism, change to brain morphology, and cerebral palsy, with the strongest associations found with exposures during pregnancy [ 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 ]. individual op pesticides have been banned or restricted in some jurisdictions, such as the european union, canada, and the state of california in the united states due to concerns about health risks to children. in california, after december 31, 2020, growers were no longer allowed to use or possess chlorpyrifos products (with the exception of a few granular products that were < 1% of total chlorpyrifos use) [ 8 ]. despite the elimination of these specific op pesticides, the use of organophosphates remains widespread in agricultural areas in the united states and california [ 1 , 9 ]. california is a major agricultural producer of fruits, nuts, vegetables and cotton, all of which are considered significant sites for op use [ 10 , 11 ]. farmworkers and agricultural communities have been identified as populations most likely to be exposed to op pesticides. potential routes of exposure include diet, occupational exposures (including take-home), and for those living close to fields with pesticide applications, pesticide drift can result in the contamination of air, water, and household dust [ 12 ]. residential proximity to pesticide applications—including the application of op pesticides— has been linked to increased levels of pesticide metabolites in urine and increased concentrations in household dust and ambient air at distances up to 4 km from applications [ 13 , 14 , 15 , 16 , 17 , 18 , 19 ]. multiple studies have found associations between residential proximity to total and individual op pesticide applications during pregnancy and adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes in children. for example, living within 2 km of chlorpyrifos, diazinon, and malathion applications during pregnancy has been associated with increased risk of autism spectrum disorder in children; [ 20 ] residence within 2 km of dimethoate applications during pregnancy has been associated to cerebral palsy in female births; [ 5 ] residence within 1 km of acephate and oxydemeton-methyl applications during pregnancy has been linked to reduced full scale iq; [ 4 ] and living within 1–1.25 km of total op pesticide applications during pregnancy has been linked to autism spectrum disorder, reduced iq in children, and altered brain activity in adolescents [ 4 , 21 , 22 ]. most of this research has been conducted in california, where all agricultural pesticide applications must be reported to the state, providing a unique opportunity for research. before the state of california’s chlorpyrifos ban, chlorpyrifos was the most widely used op pesticide in california. its use was highest in the central valley (85%) and frequently used on almond, alfalfa, walnut, orange, and cotton crops [ 23 ]. statewide assessments in california conducted before the ban found pronounced geographic variability and racial and ethnic disparities associated with residential proximity to the use of chlorpyrifos and other agricultural pesticides [ 23 , 24 ]. sources of these disparities include variations in growing regions, crops, climate, and land use patterns with respect to the racial/ethnic composition of impacted communities [ 23 , 25 ]. state and federal regulatory action has largely focused on chlorpyrifos in recent years, in part because of its predominant use amongst agricultural op pesticides. the california chlorpyrifos ban, which prohibited 99% of use, was proposed in march of 2019 and implemented in stages. an initial restriction of sales and distribution occurred between november 2019 and february 2020, and a ban on possession and use started on january 1, 2021. granular applications, reported as less than 1% of agricultural use in 2020, were exempted [ 8 , 26 ]. the us environmental protection agency (epa) is reviewing the op class of pesticides and is projected to make regulatory determinations for individual pesticides and a cumulative assessment of the risk from combined exposure to the entire class before october 2026 [ 27 ]. additional assessments of non-chlorpyrifos op pesticides have not been announced in california, nor have there been studies evaluating replacement pest control practices. although multiple scientific reviews have found evidence of developmental neurotoxicity for individual op pesticides and combined op pesticide exposures, there remains considerable variability in the consideration of developmental neurotoxicity in regulatory assessments among countries and within the united states [ 2 , 7 , 12 ]. because of the public health significance of the op class of pesticides, it is important to examine and characterize the continued use and distribution of op pesticide use in the state following the cancellation of chlorpyrifos, especially in proximity to vulnerable populations, such as pregnant people. the distribution and potential impact of op pesticide use in agriculture since the cancellation of chlorpyrifos has not previously been described. we investigated changes in agricultural op pesticide use in california before and after the chlorpyrifos ban and we assessed the spatial and demographic patterns of op pesticide use in proximity to the residences (within 1 km) of pregnant people who gave birth in 2021– the year after the ban was in effect. methods data sources agricultural op pesticide use was collected from the california department of pesticide regulation’s (cdpr) pesticide use reporting (pur) program for all organophosphate pesticides reported in 2016 and/or 2021: acephate, bensulide, chlorpyrifos, diazinon, dichlorvos, dimethoate, disulfoton, ethoprop, fenthion, malathion, methidathion, methyl-parathion, mevinphos, naled, oxydemeton-methyl, phorate, phosmet, tetrachlorvinphos, tribufos and trichlorfon [ 28 ]. data for op pesticide applications statewide, by region (see supplemental table 1 for region descriptions) and by county, were examined for 2016 (4 years prior to the chlorpyrifos cancellation in 2020) and 2021 (the first year where possession and use of 99% of uses were prohibited) [ 8 ]. this time period was chosen to capture op pesticide use before california began the reevaluation of chlorpyrifos in 2017 and a sufficient interval to avoid year-to-year variability which cdpr attributes to weather and changes in cultivation patterns [ 29 , 30 ]. only reports of op pesticide use with a valid location (which identifies the 1.6 × 1.6 km section defined by the public land survey system (plss)), application date, agricultural site, amount of active ingredient in the applied pesticide product, and acres treated were included. agricultural site records for op pesticides applications in the 2021 pur provided information on crops and cultivation patterns. to further refine the location of op pesticide applications from the pur data, the california department of water resources (dwr) 2020 crop mapping dataset was used to identify individual polygons with agricultural land uses within the plss section [ 31 ]. applications of op pesticides were spatially linked to the dwr land use maps through crop type information to more accurately identify where the pesticides were likely applied. birth records from january 1 st - december 31 st, 2021 were collected from the california department of public health’s center for health statistics and informatics birth statistical master file [ 32 ]. information on the date of birth and pregnant person’s address, age, and race/ethnicity at the time of birth were included. residential addresses of pregnant persons were deduplicated for those with multiple births, cleaned, and geocoded, resulting in residential addresses for 390,633 births (93.7% of total births in 2021). this protocol was reviewed, and the need for consent to participate was waived, by the california health and human service agency’s committee for the protection of human subjects in accordance with the us federal policy for the protection of human subjects (the “common rule”). assessment of nearby op use during pregnancy applications of op pesticide use near each pregnant person’s residence were assigned based on temporal (approximate length of pregnancy) and spatial estimates (a one-kilometer buffer zone around the home). the time window of nearby pesticide applications for each pregnancy was determined based on the estimated date of conception through the delivery date. all pregnancies were treated as 40 weeks long when calculating the date of conception and address on the birth record was assumed to reflect residence throughout the entire pregnancy. the 1 km buffer zone around the residence was chosen to be consistent with a cohort study which found associations between op applications within 1 km of maternal address during pregnancy and reduced iq in the children, and is a distance commonly used in other epidemiologic proximity studies in california [ 4 ]. to spatially refine the pur records of op pesticide applications, each application record was matched to one or more land-use polygons from the california department of water resources (dwr) 2020 crop mapping dataset. this method, described by rull and ritz (2003) and used in other studies examining proximity to agricultural pesticide use, links the plss and site locations listed in the pesticide use reports to specific land-use polygons and crop types (defined by dwr to classify land use) through a tiered matching system [ 33 , 34 ]. if multiple polygons with the same crop type were co-located within a plss section, then the related application from the pur database was apportioned among those fields, assuming that pesticides were applied at the same rate across the entire application area. for pur applications that could not be linked to the dwr land-use polygon level, the op pesticide applications were apportioned across the entire plss section. the kilograms of op pesticides applied near each pregnant person’s residence were calculated based on the proportion of intersection between the 1 km buffer zone around the geocoded point and the dwr land-use polygons (or plss section if polygons could not be linked). for example, if 20% of the land-use polygon area fell within the 1 km buffer zone, 20% of the total kilograms of op pesticide applications would be assigned to the pregnant person’s residence. the proportional amount of individual and cumulative op pesticides applied during the estimated time frame of each pregnancy within the area of intersection were summed. we performed chi-squared tests to assess differences between the race/ethnicity and age groups among the number of pregnant people with op pesticide use within 1 km of their residence and kruskal-wallis tests for the median kilograms of op pesticides applied nearby. applications of op pesticide use near each pregnant person’s residence were aggregated by county and region to assess patterns of use across california and to avoid disclosure of individual births in geographic areas with low counts as per california department of health care services data de-identification guidelines. results there was a 54% reduction in statewide agricultural op pesticide use from 2016 to 2021 (fig. 1 ), from 1,001,104 kg to 464,686 kg (p-value < 0.001). in 2016, chlorpyrifos accounted for 41% of all op pesticide applications (by weight), compared to 1% in 2021. use of chlorpyrifos decreased from 408,295 kg in 2016 to 2,769 kg in 2021 ( p -value = 0.002). although chlorpyrifos accounted for 59% of the total reduction in op pesticide use, there were also decreases in applications of most other op pesticides over this time period. use decreased significantly for acephate (68,487 kg to 48,639 kg, p -value = 0.01), dimethoate (110,113 kg to 41,802 kg, p -value < 0.001), malathion (141,840 kg to 108,179 kg, p -value = 0.04), and oxydemeton-methyl (1,707 kg to 0.01 kg, p -value = 0.002). bensulide was the only op pesticide that appeared to increase in total statewide usage by weight from 2016 to 2021, but it was not statistically significant (p-value 0.3). fig. 1 agricultural organophosphate pesticide use (kg) before (2016) and after (2021) the cancellation of chlorpyrifos (2020) * includes fenthion, dichlorvos, disulfoton, tetrachlorvinphos, and mevinphos (2016); trichlorfon (2021); methyl-parathion, methidathion, ethoprop, oxydemeton-methyl, tribufos, phorate, and phosmet (2016 and 2021) full size image comparison of op pesticide use between regions is difficult because regions differ widely in area, arable land, climate and population density. however, temporal changes in agricultural op pesticide use between 2016 and 2021 varied by growing region and county in california (table 1 ). in 2016, the san joaquin valley region used the largest amount of agricultural op pesticides (605,116 kg). op pesticide use in the san joaquin valley reduced 73.9% from 2016 to 2021 following the cancellation of chlorpyrifos, with the largest reduction in kern county (−87%). large reductions in op pesticide use were also seen in most other regions of california, ranging from − 30.7% to −76.0%. only the central coast region measured an increase (+ 0.5%) in agricultural op use during this time. two of the five counties in the central coast region reported an increase in total agricultural op pesticide use from 2016 to 2021: monterey county (+ 26%) and santa barbara county (+ 4%) (see supplemental table 2). in 2021, the areas with the highest intensity of op pesticide use were in monterey county and santa barbara county (central coast), imperial county (southern california), and kings county (san joaquin valley). the op pesticide use in these counties was highly concentrated with areas reporting an intensity of 6250–13,550 kg per township (9.6 × 9.6 km) (fig. 2 ). table 1 agricultural op pesticide use (kg) by california growing region before and after the cancellation of chlorpyrifos full size table fig. 2 op pesticide applications in 2021 full size image although bensulide was the most heavily applied organophosphate (by weight) in california in 2021, acephate and malathion were the most frequently used within 1 km of homes during pregnancy (table 2 ). in total, 29,386 pregnant people (7.5% of all 2021 births in california) lived within 1 km of op use over the course of the pregnancy (use occurred in 2020 and/or 2021 depending on the timing of the birth). the number of different op pesticides used within 1 km of a pregnant person’s home during gestation ranged from 1 to 6. chlorpyrifos was used within 1 km of homes for 3% of the pregnant people with residences within 1 km of op use, representing use that occurred in 2020 during the phase-down and a small amount of reported use in 2021. table 2 percent a of california births in 2021 with op pesticide applications within 1 km of residence during pregnancy, by chemical and region full size table agricultural op pesticide use near pregnant people’s residence differed statewide by race/ethnicity and age groups (table 3 ). hispanic/latine had the highest number (17,579 persons) and greatest proportion of population (10%) and were more likely to live within 1 km of op pesticide use during pregnancy compared to non-hispanic whites (p-value < 0.0001). hispanic/latine people also experienced the largest amount of median op pesticide use within 1 km of residence during pregnancy on average (3.30 kg). younger pregnant people experienced a higher median weight of op use within 1 km of residence during pregnancy and were more likely to live within 1 km of op pesticide use during pregnancy compared to those age 30–34 (p-value < 0.0001). table 3 residence within 1 km of op pesticide use during pregnancy by race/ethnicity and age (all california births in 2021, n = 390,633) full size table the proportion of pregnant people with op pesticide use within 1 km of residence during pregnancy varied by growing region and county (fig. 3 ). in 9 counties, greater than 1 in 5 pregnant people (> 20%) experienced op applications within 1 km of their residence (table 4 ). the majority of these counties are in the central coast region of california; in this region, the median op pesticide use within 1 km of residence during pregnancy ranged from 14 to 69 kg, compared to 2 kg statewide among those with nearby op pesticide use. pregnant people in monterey county experienced the highest use of op pesticides within 1 km of their residence during pregnancy (25th percentile = 17 kg; 75th percentile = 168 kg). monterey county also had the highest proportion of pregnant people (50%) with op pesticide use within 1 km of their residence during pregnancy. fig. 3 percent of pregnancies with op application(s) within 1 km of residence, by county and region full size image table 4 proportion of pregnant people and quartiles of op use (kg) within 1 km of residence full size table in the area with the greatest op pesticide use in proximity to pregnancies, monterey county, bensulide, malathion, and naled were the op pesticides applied the most (by weight) within 1 km of pregnant people’s residence (table 5 ). bensulide had the highest geometric mean by weight (kg), and the highest percentile usage within 1 km of residence during pregnancy (25th percentile = 11 kg; 75th percentile = 2399 kg). the geometric mean for all op pesticide applications within 1 km of residence during pregnancy in monterey county was 42 kg. the mean number of op pesticides used within 1 km of residence during pregnancy was 3 and the maximum was 6. table 5 monterey county op pesticide use (kg) and quartile of usage (kg) within 1 km of residence during pregnancy in 2021 full size table overall, the top five op pesticides applied in the greatest quantity (by weight) in monterey county were bensulide (77,553 kg), acephate (13,263 kg), malathion (12,037 kg), naled (9717 kg), and dimethoate (1938 kg). in monterey county, and in other central coast counties, these pesticides are used predominantly on lettuce, strawberries, and cole crops (e.g. cabbage, broccoli, brussels sprouts). in contrast, crops cultivated with op pesticide use in sutter, merced and tulare counties (that are geographically located in the sacramento and san joaquin valley, together considered the central valley) were tree nuts and citrus; crops cultivated with op pesticide use in imperial county (in the southern part of the state) were more variable. (see supplemental table 3). racial/ethnic disparities in residential proximity to op use in monterey county are consistent with statewide trends, though the proportions of impacted pregnant people are larger in monterey county (not shown). proportionally, five-fold more hispanic/latine pregnant persons lived within 1 km of op pesticide use in monterey county (57%) compared to hispanic/latine pregnant persons statewide (10%). similar to statewide trends, a greater proportion of younger pregnant persons in monterey resided within 1 km of op pesticide use during pregnancy. discussion we found a 54% decrease in overall kilograms of agricultural op pesticide use in california between 2016 and 2021, following the statewide chlorpyrifos ban in 2020. despite this decrease, we found that 7.5% of all pregnant people in california who gave birth in 2021 lived within 1 km of agricultural fields where op pesticides had been used during their pregnancy. in one california county, more than 50% of pregnant people lived within 1 km of op pesticide use. there were considerable disparities by race/ethnicity, age, and region; hispanic/latine, younger people, and residents of the predominantly fruit and vegetable growing central coast region were the most likely to live near op pesticide applications during pregnancy. this region was also the only area where op pesticide use did not decrease from 2016 to 2021. this study is the first to use available data sources to quantify and describe populations vulnerable to adverse health outcomes based on residential proximity to agricultural applications of op pesticides since the cancellation of chlorpyrifos. our finding that 7.5% of pregnancies in 2021 were within 1 km of op pesticide applications is consistent with other california studies documenting the proximity of agricultural applications of pesticides to residential communities [ 4 , 5 , 15 , 23 ]. of the nine counties with the highest fraction of births in proximity to op pesticide use, five (monterey, tulare, merced, imperial, ventura) were in the top 10 agricultural counties in terms of revenue in 2021 and eight were in the top 25 [ 25 ]. total reductions in op pesticide use observed at the state level were not observed in all regions and counties in california. chlorpyrifos was the most widely used op pesticide in many counties in the san joaquin valley in 2016. after the ban on chlorpyrifos, op pesticide use decreased significantly in these counties, and the region with the highest op pesticide use shifted from the san joaquin valley to the central coast. the central coast region did not experience the large reductions in total op pesticide use seen in other growing regions in the state, likely because this region has a different crop mix with lower historical use of chlorpyrifos compared to the san joaquin valley [ 23 ]. as a result, the potential public health benefits from reductions in total op pesticide use following the cancellation of chlorpyrifos are unlikely to be shared across the state. our results show a concentration of op pesticide use in the central coast region overall and within proximity to the homes of pregnant people. some common cultivation patterns may be driving the concentration of op pesticide use in central coast counties. lettuce cultivation was a major user of op pesticides in the counties with the highest op pesticide use and, of the counties where lettuce was reported as a leading commodity in the 2021 agricultural statistics, all but one (imperial) are located in the central coast. notably all of the major lettuce producing counties, including imperial, were among the top counties in terms of op pesticide use near pregnancies [ 25 ]. similarly, strawberry and cole crop (broccoli, cabbage, cauliflower, and brussels sprouts) cultivation are concentrated in central coast counties. lettuce, strawberries, and cole crops are labor intensive, resulting in large populations living in close proximity to fields. in contrast, the central valley of california, which includes the sacramento and san joaquin valley growing regions, op pesticide applications were historically dominated by chlorpyrifos use on tree nuts and citrus [ 23 ]. overall, in these regions, chlorpyrifos applications do not seem to have been replaced by large increases in applications of other op pesticides. however, we did identify three counties, sutter, merced, and tulare, with a higher percentage of pregnant people living near op pesticide applications. in two of these counties, op pesticide use is predominantly on citrus and tree nuts which is similar to the historical drivers of chlorpyrifos use in the region. further investigation is warranted to determine if the use of op pesticides near pregnant people in these counties compared to neighboring counties stems from differing pest control practices or land use patterns. linkage of op pesticide application data with birth records revealed novel findings that differ from just examining the application data on its own. although bensulide was the op pesticides with the greatest total use by weight in the state in 2021, acephate and malathion were used more frequently in proximity to the homes of pregnant people in our analysis. we also found geographic areas of very high intensity of aggregate op pesticide use within 1 km of pregnant people. this could be the result of differential application frequencies and rates between the pesticides and/or differences in land use patterns where housing is in close proximity to multiple agricultural fields. our finding that a large number of pregnant people in california live in homes that are close to op pesticide applications is of public health concern. in a study conducted in monterey county, residential proximity within 1 km of op pesticide use during pregnancy was associated with lower iq in children, with one standard deviation increase in total op pesticide use near the home (237 kg) being associated with a 2-point decrease (15% of a standard deviation) in full scale iq at age 7 [ 4 ]. we found that more than half of all pregnant people in monterey county lived within 1 km of op pesticide use, suggesting that a large population may be at increased risk of iq decrements, autism, or other adverse neurodevelopmental impacts [ 20 , 21 ]. we found an increased likelihood for pregnant people identifying as hispanic/latine to reside near op pesticide applications and to reside near greater amounts of op pesticide applications, which is consistent with other analyses of racial/ethnic disparities in pesticide exposures [ 23 , 24 , 35 ]. racial/ethnic disparities in op pesticide exposures for pregnant people identifying as hispanic/latine were higher in monterey county than the state overall. our study also identified young pregnant people under the age of 20 as a population potentially more exposed to op pesticides during pregnancy, which may compound other pregnancy vulnerabilities for this age group [ 36 ]. our findings add to a larger body of research documenting exposure disparities that may contribute to racial and ethnic health disparities for children [ 35 ]. the analysis of chlorpyrifos use patterns before and after the ban provides some suggestive evidence of the impact of the ban on op exposures during pregnancy. pesticide use data on chlorpyrifos applications in 2015 (pre-ban) found chlorpyrifos use highly concentrated in the san joaquin valley and positively associated with population density, suggesting the potential for residential proximity to chlorpyrifos applications [ 23 ]. combined with our finding of a large decrease in op pesticide use in the san joaquin valley after the ban, there’s evidence that, in some regions of california, the ban likely decreased the likelihood of pregnant people living in proximity to chlorpyrifos applications. unfortunately, we were not able to compare pregnancies in 2016 to 2021, so direct quantitative comparison of op pesticide use in proximity to pregnancies before and after the chlorpyrifos ban is beyond the scope of this study. our study is limited by the accuracy of the data sets we relied upon. there may be errors in the pesticide application data reported to the state of california in the publicly available pur files. however, reporting of pesticide applications is required of all agricultural growers, enforced by county agricultural commissioners, and undergoes extensive quality control checks prior to public release [ 37 ]. not all op pesticides have equal toxicity. relative potency factors are available that compare acetylcholinesterase inhibition across the individual op pesticides [ 38 ]. using these potency factors, several of the ops currently used in high amounts in california are more potent than chlorpyrifos (acephate, dimethoate and naled) and others are less potent (bensulide and malathion) making it difficult to assess how use of other ops has impacted the overall toxicity. there is also uncertainty as to whether potency for acetylcholinesterase inhibition is predictive of developmental neurotoxicity [ 12 ]. in addition, according to the california pesticide use reporting (pur) reporting, 72.1% of the kilograms of op pesticides were applied by ground and 22.6% were applied by air [ 39 ]. although aerial applications are likely to result in increased exposure due to drift, some ground based application methods such as canon or airblast orchard sprayers also increase off site drift [ 40 ]. as a result, accurately accounting for spray drift based on the application method was not possible using the pur data. there may be inaccuracy in our findings stemming from errors in the data reported on birth certificates for 2021 births, but these errors are assumed to affect only a small number of records. there is also possible misclassification error stemming from our assumptions that the address reported on the birth certificate corresponds to the residence during the entire pregnancy [ 41 ]. moves during pregnancy could occur both within the 1 km buffer distance or outside of it, resulting in either under- or over-estimation of the number of pregnancies potentially exposed to op pesticide applications and the amount (in kilograms) of op pesticides applied. overestimation could occur if pregnancies of shorter duration were linked to agricultural applications that only happened in the latter weeks of pregnancy, which seems unlikely to have a large impact on our findings. seasonality of op pesticide applications could account for some differences seen in the kilograms of applications occurring near individual residences; however, this is not likely to impact county and regional differences assuming births are distributed evenly throughout the year. the magnitude of people potentially exposed to op pesticides during pregnancy in california is likely underestimated because we only captured potential exposures occurring as a result of pesticide drift into the home from neighboring fields. op pesticide applications near workplaces, schools, or other areas in the community are also sources of potential exposure for pregnant people, regardless of their home address. additionally, pregnant people in agricultural communities may be exposed to op pesticide applications while working in the fields or as a result of op pesticide residues brought home by other agricultural workers living in the home [ 42 ]. our use of birth record data to identify pregnancies likely undercounts the total number and proportion of pregnancies with residential proximity to op pesticide applications because of the exclusion of spontaneous abortions and stillbirths which have been found to be associated with proximity to agricultural op use [ 43 ]. our analyses show that op pesticide use decreased dramatically in many california counties with the cancelling of chlorpyrifos, particularly in the nut tree and citrus-dominated central valley. however, op use and residential proximity remains high in the central coast region with lettuce, cole crop, and strawberry cultivation. our findings suggest that agricultural transition to non-chemical production and/or pesticides that are not reproductive toxicants could reduce adverse prenatal exposures for a large population in the central coast region of california. conclusions regulatory restriction and phase-out of most uses of chlorpyrifos reduced the potential for op pesticide exposures during pregnancy in some parts of the state, but hot-spots for agricultural op pesticide use remain. the high number of births statewide, particularly in high-use counties, to pregnant people who lived within 1 km of op pesticide use at levels similar to those linked to adverse impacts for the child in epidemiologic studies suggests that regulatory changes to limit the use of or restrict applications in close proximity to residential areas (buffer zones) could have a substantial public health benefit [ 44 ]. additionally, the use of op pesticides in proximity to pregnancies included multiple op chemistries, and our study found many pregnancies were in proximity to more than one op pesticide application. current regulatory practices in california to assess health threats from each individual pesticide may not accurately capture potential impacts of exposure to multiple pesticides with similar adverse health endpoints. data availability the birth certificate dataset

we calculated the absolute change in agricultural op pesticide applications (by weight) in california before and after the chlorpyrifos ban (2016–2021) and investigated the spatial and demographic patterns of op applications within 1 km of residences during pregnancy for all births in california in 2021. geocoded residential addresses from 2021 california birth certificates were linked with publicly available records of pesticide applications within 1 km. kilograms of op pesticides applied during the estimated duration of the pregnancy were proportioned based on the area of intersection between the 1 km buffer zone and land-use polygons with crop data. results we found a 54% decrease in overall kilograms of op pesticide use in california between 2016 and 2021 following the chlorpyrifos ban in 2020. despite this decrease, we found that 7.5% of all pregnant people in california who gave birth in 2021 lived within 1 km of agricultural fields where op pesticides had been used during their pregnancy; in one county, more than 50% of pregnant people lived within 1 km of op pesticide use. there were considerable disparities by race/ethnicity, age, and region, with hispanic/latine, younger people, and residents of the predominantly fruit and vegetable growing central coast region being most likely to live near op pesticide applications during pregnancy. conclusions a high number of births statewide, particularly in high use counties, were to pregnant people who lived within 1 km of op pesticide use at levels similar to those linked to adverse impacts for the child in epidemiologic studies. this suggests that regulatory changes to limit use or restrict applications in close proximity to residential areas could have a substantial public health benefit on children’s brain development. peer review reports background organophosphate (op) pesticides are broad-spectrum insecticides widely used in agriculture, primarily on fruits, vegetables, grains, and fiber crops. op pesticides are neurotoxicants that inhibit the neurotransmitter acetylcholinesterase resulting in acute toxicity marked by muscle spasms, confusion, dizziness, loss of consciousness, seizures, abdominal cramps, vomiting, diarrhea, cessation of breathing, paralysis, and death in extreme cases [ 1 ]. early life exposure to some op pesticides has been linked to neurodevelopmental impacts including reduced iq, adhd, autism, change to brain morphology, and cerebral palsy, with the strongest associations found with exposures during pregnancy [ 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 ]. individual op pesticides have been banned or restricted in some jurisdictions, such as the european union, canada, and the state of california in the united states due to concerns about health risks to children. in california, after december 31, 2020, growers were no longer allowed to use or possess chlorpyrifos products (with the exception of a few granular products that were < 1% of total chlorpyrifos use) [ 8 ]. despite the elimination of these specific op pesticides, the use of organophosphates remains widespread in agricultural areas in the united states and california [ 1 , 9 ]. california is a major agricultural producer of fruits, nuts, vegetables and cotton, all of which are considered significant sites for op use [ 10 , 11 ]. farmworkers and agricultural communities have been identified as populations most likely to be exposed to op pesticides. potential routes of exposure include diet, occupational exposures (including take-home), and for those living close to fields with pesticide applications, pesticide drift can result in the contamination of air, water, and household dust [ 12 ]. residential proximity to pesticide applications—including the application of op pesticides— has been linked to increased levels of pesticide metabolites in urine and increased concentrations in household dust and ambient air at distances up to 4 km from applications [ 13 , 14 , 15 , 16 , 17 , 18 , 19 ]. multiple studies have found associations between residential proximity to total and individual op pesticide applications during pregnancy and adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes in children. for example, living within 2 km of chlorpyrifos, diazinon, and malathion applications during pregnancy has been associated with increased risk of autism spectrum disorder in children; [ 20 ] residence within 2 km of dimethoate applications during pregnancy has been associated to cerebral palsy in female births; [ 5 ] residence within 1 km of acephate and oxydemeton-methyl applications during pregnancy has been linked to reduced full scale iq; [ 4 ] and living within 1–1.25 km of total op pesticide applications during pregnancy has been linked to autism spectrum disorder, reduced iq in children, and altered brain activity in adolescents [ 4 , 21 , 22 ]. most of this research has been conducted in california, where all agricultural pesticide applications must be reported to the state, providing a unique opportunity for research. before the state of california’s chlorpyrifos ban, chlorpyrifos was the most widely used op pesticide in california. its use was highest in the central valley (85%) and frequently used on almond, alfalfa, walnut, orange, and cotton crops [ 23 ]. statewide assessments in california conducted before the ban found pronounced geographic variability and racial and ethnic disparities associated with residential proximity to the use of chlorpyrifos and other agricultural pesticides [ 23 , 24 ]. sources of these disparities include variations in growing regions, crops, climate, and land use patterns with respect to the racial/ethnic composition of impacted communities [ 23 , 25 ]. state and federal regulatory action has largely focused on chlorpyrifos in recent years, in part because of its predominant use amongst agricultural op pesticides. the california chlorpyrifos ban, which prohibited 99% of use, was proposed in march of 2019 and implemented in stages. an initial restriction of sales and distribution occurred between november 2019 and february 2020, and a ban on possession and use started on january 1, 2021. granular applications, reported as less than 1% of agricultural use in 2020, were exempted [ 8 , 26 ]. the us environmental protection agency (epa) is reviewing the op class of pesticides and is projected to make regulatory determinations for individual pesticides and a cumulative assessment of the risk from combined exposure to the entire class before october 2026 [ 27 ]. additional assessments of non-chlorpyrifos op pesticides have not been announced in california, nor have there been studies evaluating replacement pest control practices. although multiple scientific reviews have found evidence of developmental neurotoxicity for individual op pesticides and combined op pesticide exposures, there remains considerable variability in the consideration of developmental neurotoxicity in regulatory assessments among countries and within the united states [ 2 , 7 , 12 ]. because of the public health significance of the op class of pesticides, it is important to examine and characterize the continued use and distribution of op pesticide use in the state following the cancellation of chlorpyrifos, especially in proximity to vulnerable populations, such as pregnant people. the distribution and potential impact of op pesticide use in agriculture since the cancellation of chlorpyrifos has not previously been described. we investigated changes in agricultural op pesticide use in california before and after the chlorpyrifos ban and we assessed the spatial and demographic patterns of op pesticide use in proximity to the residences (within 1 km) of pregnant people who gave birth in 2021– the year after the ban was in effect. methods data sources agricultural op pesticide use was collected from the california department of pesticide regulation’s (cdpr) pesticide use reporting (pur) program for all organophosphate pesticides reported in 2016 and/or 2021: acephate, bensulide, chlorpyrifos, diazinon, dichlorvos, dimethoate, disulfoton, ethoprop, fenthion, malathion, methidathion, methyl-parathion, mevinphos, naled, oxydemeton-methyl, phorate, phosmet, tetrachlorvinphos, tribufos and trichlorfon [ 28 ]. data for op pesticide applications statewide, by region (see supplemental table 1 for region descriptions) and by county, were examined for 2016 (4 years prior to the chlorpyrifos cancellation in 2020) and 2021 (the first year where possession and use of 99% of uses were prohibited) [ 8 ]. this time period was chosen to capture op pesticide use before california began the reevaluation of chlorpyrifos in 2017 and a sufficient interval to avoid year-to-year variability which cdpr attributes to weather and changes in cultivation patterns [ 29 , 30 ]. only reports of op pesticide use with a valid location (which identifies the 1.6 × 1.6 km section defined by the public land survey system (plss)), application date, agricultural site, amount of active ingredient in the applied pesticide product, and acres treated were included. agricultural site records for op pesticides applications in the 2021 pur provided information on crops and cultivation patterns. to further refine the location of op pesticide applications from the pur data, the california department of water resources (dwr) 2020 crop mapping dataset was used to identify individual polygons with agricultural land uses within the plss section [ 31 ]. applications of op pesticides were spatially linked to the dwr land use maps through crop type information to more accurately identify where the pesticides were likely applied. birth records from january 1 st - december 31 st, 2021 were collected from the california department of public health’s center for health statistics and informatics birth statistical master file [ 32 ]. information on the date of birth and pregnant person’s address, age, and race/ethnicity at the time of birth were included. residential addresses of pregnant persons were deduplicated for those with multiple births, cleaned, and geocoded, resulting in residential addresses for 390,633 births (93.7% of total births in 2021). this protocol was reviewed, and the need for consent to participate was waived, by the california health and human service agency’s committee for the protection of human subjects in accordance with the us federal policy for the protection of human subjects (the “common rule”). assessment of nearby op use during pregnancy applications of op pesticide use near each pregnant person’s residence were assigned based on temporal (approximate length of pregnancy) and spatial estimates (a one-kilometer buffer zone around the home). the time window of nearby pesticide applications for each pregnancy was determined based on the estimated date of conception through the delivery date. all pregnancies were treated as 40 weeks long when calculating the date of conception and address on the birth record was assumed to reflect residence throughout the entire pregnancy. the 1 km buffer zone around the residence was chosen to be consistent with a cohort study which found associations between op applications within 1 km of maternal address during pregnancy and reduced iq in the children, and is a distance commonly used in other epidemiologic proximity studies in california [ 4 ]. to spatially refine the pur records of op pesticide applications, each application record was matched to one or more land-use polygons from the california department of water resources (dwr) 2020 crop mapping dataset. this method, described by rull and ritz (2003) and used in other studies examining proximity to agricultural pesticide use, links the plss and site locations listed in the pesticide use reports to specific land-use polygons and crop types (defined by dwr to classify land use) through a tiered matching system [ 33 , 34 ]. if multiple polygons with the same crop type were co-located within a plss section, then the related application from the pur database was apportioned among those fields, assuming that pesticides were applied at the same rate across the entire application area. for pur applications that could not be linked to the dwr land-use polygon level, the op pesticide applications were apportioned across the entire plss section. the kilograms of op pesticides applied near each pregnant person’s residence were calculated based on the proportion of intersection between the 1 km buffer zone around the geocoded point and the dwr land-use polygons (or plss section if polygons could not be linked). for example, if 20% of the land-use polygon area fell within the 1 km buffer zone, 20% of the total kilograms of op pesticide applications would be assigned to the pregnant person’s residence. the proportional amount of individual and cumulative op pesticides applied during the estimated time frame of each pregnancy within the area of intersection were summed. we performed chi-squared tests to assess differences between the race/ethnicity and age groups among the number of pregnant people with op pesticide use within 1 km of their residence and kruskal-wallis tests for the median kilograms of op pesticides applied nearby. applications of op pesticide use near each pregnant person’s residence were aggregated by county and region to assess patterns of use across california and to avoid disclosure of individual births in geographic areas with low counts as per california department of health care services data de-identification guidelines. results there was a 54% reduction in statewide agricultural op pesticide use from 2016 to 2021 (fig. 1 ), from 1,001,104 kg to 464,686 kg (p-value < 0.001). in 2016, chlorpyrifos accounted for 41% of all op pesticide applications (by weight), compared to 1% in 2021. use of chlorpyrifos decreased from 408,295 kg in 2016 to 2,769 kg in 2021 ( p -value = 0.002). although chlorpyrifos accounted for 59% of the total reduction in op pesticide use, there were also decreases in applications of most other op pesticides over this time period. use decreased significantly for acephate (68,487 kg to 48,639 kg, p -value = 0.01), dimethoate (110,113 kg to 41,802 kg, p -value < 0.001), malathion (141,840 kg to 108,179 kg, p -value = 0.04), and oxydemeton-methyl (1,707 kg to 0.01 kg, p -value = 0.002). bensulide was the only op pesticide that appeared to increase in total statewide usage by weight from 2016 to 2021, but it was not statistically significant (p-value 0.3). fig. 1 agricultural organophosphate pesticide use (kg) before (2016) and after (2021) the cancellation of chlorpyrifos (2020) * includes fenthion, dichlorvos, disulfoton, tetrachlorvinphos, and mevinphos (2016); trichlorfon (2021); methyl-parathion, methidathion, ethoprop, oxydemeton-methyl, tribufos, phorate, and phosmet (2016 and 2021) full size image comparison of op pesticide use between regions is difficult because regions differ widely in area, arable land, climate and population density. however, temporal changes in agricultural op pesticide use between 2016 and 2021 varied by growing region and county in california (table 1 ). in 2016, the san joaquin valley region used the largest amount of agricultural op pesticides (605,116 kg). op pesticide use in the san joaquin valley reduced 73.9% from 2016 to 2021 following the cancellation of chlorpyrifos, with the largest reduction in kern county (−87%). large reductions in op pesticide use were also seen in most other regions of california, ranging from − 30.7% to −76.0%. only the central coast region measured an increase (+ 0.5%) in agricultural op use during this time. two of the five counties in the central coast region reported an increase in total agricultural op pesticide use from 2016 to 2021: monterey county (+ 26%) and santa barbara county (+ 4%) (see supplemental table 2). in 2021, the areas with the highest intensity of op pesticide use were in monterey county and santa barbara county (central coast), imperial county (southern california), and kings county (san joaquin valley). the op pesticide use in these counties was highly concentrated with areas reporting an intensity of 6250–13,550 kg per township (9.6 × 9.6 km) (fig. 2 ). table 1 agricultural op pesticide use (kg) by california growing region before and after the cancellation of chlorpyrifos full size table fig. 2 op pesticide applications in 2021 full size image although bensulide was the most heavily applied organophosphate (by weight) in california in 2021, acephate and malathion were the most frequently used within 1 km of homes during pregnancy (table 2 ). in total, 29,386 pregnant people (7.5% of all 2021 births in california) lived within 1 km of op use over the course of the pregnancy (use occurred in 2020 and/or 2021 depending on the timing of the birth). the number of different op pesticides used within 1 km of a pregnant person’s home during gestation ranged from 1 to 6. chlorpyrifos was used within 1 km of homes for 3% of the pregnant people with residences within 1 km of op use, representing use that occurred in 2020 during the phase-down and a small amount of reported use in 2021. table 2 percent a of california births in 2021 with op pesticide applications within 1 km of residence during pregnancy, by chemical and region full size table agricultural op pesticide use near pregnant people’s residence differed statewide by race/ethnicity and age groups (table 3 ). hispanic/latine had the highest number (17,579 persons) and greatest proportion of population (10%) and were more likely to live within 1 km of op pesticide use during pregnancy compared to non-hispanic whites (p-value < 0.0001). hispanic/latine people also experienced the largest amount of median op pesticide use within 1 km of residence during pregnancy on average (3.30 kg). younger pregnant people experienced a higher median weight of op use within 1 km of residence during pregnancy and were more likely to live within 1 km of op pesticide use during pregnancy compared to those age 30–34 (p-value < 0.0001). table 3 residence within 1 km of op pesticide use during pregnancy by race/ethnicity and age (all california births in 2021, n = 390,633) full size table the proportion of pregnant people with op pesticide use within 1 km of residence during pregnancy varied by growing region and county (fig. 3 ). in 9 counties, greater than 1 in 5 pregnant people (> 20%) experienced op applications within 1 km of their residence (table 4 ). the majority of these counties are in the central coast region of california; in this region, the median op pesticide use within 1 km of residence during pregnancy ranged from 14 to 69 kg, compared to 2 kg statewide among those with nearby op pesticide use. pregnant people in monterey county experienced the highest use of op pesticides within 1 km of their residence during pregnancy (25th percentile = 17 kg; 75th percentile = 168 kg). monterey county also had the highest proportion of pregnant people (50%) with op pesticide use within 1 km of their residence during pregnancy. fig. 3 percent of pregnancies with op application(s) within 1 km of residence, by county and region full size image table 4 proportion of pregnant people and quartiles of op use (kg) within 1 km of residence full size table in the area with the greatest op pesticide use in proximity to pregnancies, monterey county, bensulide, malathion, and naled were the op pesticides applied the most (by weight) within 1 km of pregnant people’s residence (table 5 ). bensulide had the highest geometric mean by weight (kg), and the highest percentile usage within 1 km of residence during pregnancy (25th percentile = 11 kg; 75th percentile = 2399 kg). the geometric mean for all op pesticide applications within 1 km of residence during pregnancy in monterey county was 42 kg. the mean number of op pesticides used within 1 km of residence during pregnancy was 3 and the maximum was 6. table 5 monterey county op pesticide use (kg) and quartile of usage (kg) within 1 km of residence during pregnancy in 2021 full size table overall, the top five op pesticides applied in the greatest quantity (by weight) in monterey county were bensulide (77,553 kg), acephate (13,263 kg), malathion (12,037 kg), naled (9717 kg), and dimethoate (1938 kg). in monterey county, and in other central coast counties, these pesticides are used predominantly on lettuce, strawberries, and cole crops (e.g. cabbage, broccoli, brussels sprouts). in contrast, crops cultivated with op pesticide use in sutter, merced and tulare counties (that are geographically located in the sacramento and san joaquin valley, together considered the central valley) were tree nuts and citrus; crops cultivated with op pesticide use in imperial county (in the southern part of the state) were more variable. (see supplemental table 3). racial/ethnic disparities in residential proximity to op use in monterey county are consistent with statewide trends, though the proportions of impacted pregnant people are larger in monterey county (not shown). proportionally, five-fold more hispanic/latine pregnant persons lived within 1 km of op pesticide use in monterey county (57%) compared to hispanic/latine pregnant persons statewide (10%). similar to statewide trends, a greater proportion of younger pregnant persons in monterey resided within 1 km of op pesticide use during pregnancy. discussion we found a 54% decrease in overall kilograms of agricultural op pesticide use in california between 2016 and 2021, following the statewide chlorpyrifos ban in 2020. despite this decrease, we found that 7.5% of all pregnant people in california who gave birth in 2021 lived within 1 km of agricultural fields where op pesticides had been used during their pregnancy. in one california county, more than 50% of pregnant people lived within 1 km of op pesticide use. there were considerable disparities by race/ethnicity, age, and region; hispanic/latine, younger people, and residents of the predominantly fruit and vegetable growing central coast region were the most likely to live near op pesticide applications during pregnancy. this region was also the only area where op pesticide use did not decrease from 2016 to 2021. this study is the first to use available data sources to quantify and describe populations vulnerable to adverse health outcomes based on residential proximity to agricultural applications of op pesticides since the cancellation of chlorpyrifos. our finding that 7.5% of pregnancies in 2021 were within 1 km of op pesticide applications is consistent with other california studies documenting the proximity of agricultural applications of pesticides to residential communities [ 4 , 5 , 15 , 23 ]. of the nine counties with the highest fraction of births in proximity to op pesticide use, five (monterey, tulare, merced, imperial, ventura) were in the top 10 agricultural counties in terms of revenue in 2021 and eight were in the top 25 [ 25 ]. total reductions in op pesticide use observed at the state level were not observed in all regions and counties in california. chlorpyrifos was the most widely used op pesticide in many counties in the san joaquin valley in 2016. after the ban on chlorpyrifos, op pesticide use decreased significantly in these counties, and the region with the highest op pesticide use shifted from the san joaquin valley to the central coast. the central coast region did not experience the large reductions in total op pesticide use seen in other growing regions in the state, likely because this region has a different crop mix with lower historical use of chlorpyrifos compared to the san joaquin valley [ 23 ]. as a result, the potential public health benefits from reductions in total op pesticide use following the cancellation of chlorpyrifos are unlikely to be shared across the state. our results show a concentration of op pesticide use in the central coast region overall and within proximity to the homes of pregnant people. some common cultivation patterns may be driving the concentration of op pesticide use in central coast counties. lettuce cultivation was a major user of op pesticides in the counties with the highest op pesticide use and, of the counties where lettuce was reported as a leading commodity in the 2021 agricultural statistics, all but one (imperial) are located in the central coast. notably all of the major lettuce producing counties, including imperial, were among the top counties in terms of op pesticide use near pregnancies [ 25 ]. similarly, strawberry and cole crop (broccoli, cabbage, cauliflower, and brussels sprouts) cultivation are concentrated in central coast counties. lettuce, strawberries, and cole crops are labor intensive, resulting in large populations living in close proximity to fields. in contrast, the central valley of california, which includes the sacramento and san joaquin valley growing regions, op pesticide applications were historically dominated by chlorpyrifos use on tree nuts and citrus [ 23 ]. overall, in these regions, chlorpyrifos applications do not seem to have been replaced by large increases in applications of other op pesticides. however, we did identify three counties, sutter, merced, and tulare, with a higher percentage of pregnant people living near op pesticide applications. in two of these counties, op pesticide use is predominantly on citrus and tree nuts which is similar to the historical drivers of chlorpyrifos use in the region. further investigation is warranted to determine if the use of op pesticides near pregnant people in these counties compared to neighboring counties stems from differing pest control practices or land use patterns. linkage of op pesticide application data with birth records revealed novel findings that differ from just examining the application data on its own. although bensulide was the op pesticides with the greatest total use by weight in the state in 2021, acephate and malathion were used more frequently in proximity to the homes of pregnant people in our analysis. we also found geographic areas of very high intensity of aggregate op pesticide use within 1 km of pregnant people. this could be the result of differential application frequencies and rates between the pesticides and/or differences in land use patterns where housing is in close proximity to multiple agricultural fields. our finding that a large number of pregnant people in california live in homes that are close to op pesticide applications is of public health concern. in a study conducted in monterey county, residential proximity within 1 km of op pesticide use during pregnancy was associated with lower iq in children, with one standard deviation increase in total op pesticide use near the home (237 kg) being associated with a 2-point decrease (15% of a standard deviation) in full scale iq at age 7 [ 4 ]. we found that more than half of all pregnant people in monterey county lived within 1 km of op pesticide use, suggesting that a large population may be at increased risk of iq decrements, autism, or other adverse neurodevelopmental impacts [ 20 , 21 ]. we found an increased likelihood for pregnant people identifying as hispanic/latine to reside near op pesticide applications and to reside near greater amounts of op pesticide applications, which is consistent with other analyses of racial/ethnic disparities in pesticide exposures [ 23 , 24 , 35 ]. racial/ethnic disparities in op pesticide exposures for pregnant people identifying as hispanic/latine were higher in monterey county than the state overall. our study also identified young pregnant people under the age of 20 as a population potentially more exposed to op pesticides during pregnancy, which may compound other pregnancy vulnerabilities for this age group [ 36 ]. our findings add to a larger body of research documenting exposure disparities that may contribute to racial and ethnic health disparities for children [ 35 ]. the analysis of chlorpyrifos use patterns before and after the ban provides some suggestive evidence of the impact of the ban on op exposures during pregnancy. pesticide use data on chlorpyrifos applications in 2015 (pre-ban) found chlorpyrifos use highly concentrated in the san joaquin valley and positively associated with population density, suggesting the potential for residential proximity to chlorpyrifos applications [ 23 ]. combined with our finding of a large decrease in op pesticide use in the san joaquin valley after the ban, there’s evidence that, in some regions of california, the ban likely decreased the likelihood of pregnant people living in proximity to chlorpyrifos applications. unfortunately, we were not able to compare pregnancies in 2016 to 2021, so direct quantitative comparison of op pesticide use in proximity to pregnancies before and after the chlorpyrifos ban is beyond the scope of this study. our study is limited by the accuracy of the data sets we relied upon. there may be errors in the pesticide application data reported to the state of california in the publicly available pur files. however, reporting of pesticide applications is required of all agricultural growers, enforced by county agricultural commissioners, and undergoes extensive quality control checks prior to public release [ 37 ]. not all op pesticides have equal toxicity. relative potency factors are available that compare acetylcholinesterase inhibition across the individual op pesticides [ 38 ]. using these potency factors, several of the ops currently used in high amounts in california are more potent than chlorpyrifos (acephate, dimethoate and naled) and others are less potent (bensulide and malathion) making it difficult to assess how use of other ops has impacted the overall toxicity. there is also uncertainty as to whether potency for acetylcholinesterase inhibition is predictive of developmental neurotoxicity [ 12 ]. in addition, according to the california pesticide use reporting (pur) reporting, 72.1% of the kilograms of op pesticides were applied by ground and 22.6% were applied by air [ 39 ]. although aerial applications are likely to result in increased exposure due to drift, some ground based application methods such as canon or airblast orchard sprayers also increase off site drift [ 40 ]. as a result, accurately accounting for spray drift based on the application method was not possible using the pur data. there may be inaccuracy in our findings stemming from errors in the data reported on birth certificates for 2021 births, but these errors are assumed to affect only a small number of records. there is also possible misclassification error stemming from our assumptions that the address reported on the birth certificate corresponds to the residence during the entire pregnancy [ 41 ]. moves during pregnancy could occur both within the 1 km buffer distance or outside of it, resulting in either under- or over-estimation of the number of pregnancies potentially exposed to op pesticide applications and the amount (in kilograms) of op pesticides applied. overestimation could occur if pregnancies of shorter duration were linked to agricultural applications that only happened in the latter weeks of pregnancy, which seems unlikely to have a large impact on our findings. seasonality of op pesticide applications could account for some differences seen in the kilograms of applications occurring near individual residences; however, this is not likely to impact county and regional differences assuming births are distributed evenly throughout the year. the magnitude of people potentially exposed to op pesticides during pregnancy in california is likely underestimated because we only captured potential exposures occurring as a result of pesticide drift into the home from neighboring fields. op pesticide applications near workplaces, schools, or other areas in the community are also sources of potential exposure for pregnant people, regardless of their home address. additionally, pregnant people in agricultural communities may be exposed to op pesticide applications while working in the fields or as a result of op pesticide residues brought home by other agricultural workers living in the home [ 42 ]. our use of birth record data to identify pregnancies likely undercounts the total number and proportion of pregnancies with residential proximity to op pesticide applications because of the exclusion of spontaneous abortions and stillbirths which have been found to be associated with proximity to agricultural op use [ 43 ]. our analyses show that op pesticide use decreased dramatically in many california counties with the cancelling of chlorpyrifos, particularly in the nut tree and citrus-dominated central valley. however, op use and residential proximity remains high in the central coast region with lettuce, cole crop, and strawberry cultivation. our findings suggest that agricultural transition to non-chemical production and/or pesticides that are not reproductive toxicants could reduce adverse prenatal exposures for a large population in the central coast region of california. conclusions regulatory restriction and phase-out of most uses of chlorpyrifos reduced the potential for op pesticide exposures during pregnancy in some parts of the state, but hot-spots for agricultural op pesticide use remain. the high number of births statewide, particularly in high-use counties, to pregnant people who lived within 1 km of op pesticide use at levels similar to those linked to adverse impacts for the child in epidemiologic studies suggests that regulatory changes to limit the use of or restrict applications in close proximity to residential areas (buffer zones) could have a substantial public health benefit [ 44 ]. additionally, the use of op pesticides in proximity to pregnancies included multiple op chemistries, and our study found many pregnancies were in proximity to more than one op pesticide application. current regulatory practices in california to assess health threats from each individual pesticide may not accurately capture potential impacts of exposure to multiple pesticides with similar adverse health endpoints. data availability the birth certificate dataset

we found a 54% decrease in overall kilograms of op pesticide use in california between 2016 and 2021 following the chlorpyrifos ban in 2020. despite this decrease, we found that 7.5% of all pregnant people in california who gave birth in 2021 lived within 1 km of agricultural fields where op pesticides had been used during their pregnancy; in one county, more than 50% of pregnant people lived within 1 km of op pesticide use. there were considerable disparities by race/ethnicity, age, and region, with hispanic/latine, younger people, and residents of the predominantly fruit and vegetable growing central coast region being most likely to live near op pesticide applications during pregnancy. conclusions a high number of births statewide, particularly in high use counties, were to pregnant people who lived within 1 km of op pesticide use at levels similar to those linked to adverse impacts for the child in epidemiologic studies. this suggests that regulatory changes to limit use or restrict applications in close proximity to residential areas could have a substantial public health benefit on children’s brain development. peer review reports background organophosphate (op) pesticides are broad-spectrum insecticides widely used in agriculture, primarily on fruits, vegetables, grains, and fiber crops. op pesticides are neurotoxicants that inhibit the neurotransmitter acetylcholinesterase resulting in acute toxicity marked by muscle spasms, confusion, dizziness, loss of consciousness, seizures, abdominal cramps, vomiting, diarrhea, cessation of breathing, paralysis, and death in extreme cases [ 1 ]. early life exposure to some op pesticides has been linked to neurodevelopmental impacts including reduced iq, adhd, autism, change to brain morphology, and cerebral palsy, with the strongest associations found with exposures during pregnancy [ 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 ]. individual op pesticides have been banned or restricted in some jurisdictions, such as the european union, canada, and the state of california in the united states due to concerns about health risks to children. in california, after december 31, 2020, growers were no longer allowed to use or possess chlorpyrifos products (with the exception of a few granular products that were < 1% of total chlorpyrifos use) [ 8 ]. despite the elimination of these specific op pesticides, the use of organophosphates remains widespread in agricultural areas in the united states and california [ 1 , 9 ]. california is a major agricultural producer of fruits, nuts, vegetables and cotton, all of which are considered significant sites for op use [ 10 , 11 ]. farmworkers and agricultural communities have been identified as populations most likely to be exposed to op pesticides. potential routes of exposure include diet, occupational exposures (including take-home), and for those living close to fields with pesticide applications, pesticide drift can result in the contamination of air, water, and household dust [ 12 ]. residential proximity to pesticide applications—including the application of op pesticides— has been linked to increased levels of pesticide metabolites in urine and increased concentrations in household dust and ambient air at distances up to 4 km from applications [ 13 , 14 , 15 , 16 , 17 , 18 , 19 ]. multiple studies have found associations between residential proximity to total and individual op pesticide applications during pregnancy and adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes in children. for example, living within 2 km of chlorpyrifos, diazinon, and malathion applications during pregnancy has been associated with increased risk of autism spectrum disorder in children; [ 20 ] residence within 2 km of dimethoate applications during pregnancy has been associated to cerebral palsy in female births; [ 5 ] residence within 1 km of acephate and oxydemeton-methyl applications during pregnancy has been linked to reduced full scale iq; [ 4 ] and living within 1–1.25 km of total op pesticide applications during pregnancy has been linked to autism spectrum disorder, reduced iq in children, and altered brain activity in adolescents [ 4 , 21 , 22 ]. most of this research has been conducted in california, where all agricultural pesticide applications must be reported to the state, providing a unique opportunity for research. before the state of california’s chlorpyrifos ban, chlorpyrifos was the most widely used op pesticide in california. its use was highest in the central valley (85%) and frequently used on almond, alfalfa, walnut, orange, and cotton crops [ 23 ]. statewide assessments in california conducted before the ban found pronounced geographic variability and racial and ethnic disparities associated with residential proximity to the use of chlorpyrifos and other agricultural pesticides [ 23 , 24 ]. sources of these disparities include variations in growing regions, crops, climate, and land use patterns with respect to the racial/ethnic composition of impacted communities [ 23 , 25 ]. state and federal regulatory action has largely focused on chlorpyrifos in recent years, in part because of its predominant use amongst agricultural op pesticides. the california chlorpyrifos ban, which prohibited 99% of use, was proposed in march of 2019 and implemented in stages. an initial restriction of sales and distribution occurred between november 2019 and february 2020, and a ban on possession and use started on january 1, 2021. granular applications, reported as less than 1% of agricultural use in 2020, were exempted [ 8 , 26 ]. the us environmental protection agency (epa) is reviewing the op class of pesticides and is projected to make regulatory determinations for individual pesticides and a cumulative assessment of the risk from combined exposure to the entire class before october 2026 [ 27 ]. additional assessments of non-chlorpyrifos op pesticides have not been announced in california, nor have there been studies evaluating replacement pest control practices. although multiple scientific reviews have found evidence of developmental neurotoxicity for individual op pesticides and combined op pesticide exposures, there remains considerable variability in the consideration of developmental neurotoxicity in regulatory assessments among countries and within the united states [ 2 , 7 , 12 ]. because of the public health significance of the op class of pesticides, it is important to examine and characterize the continued use and distribution of op pesticide use in the state following the cancellation of chlorpyrifos, especially in proximity to vulnerable populations, such as pregnant people. the distribution and potential impact of op pesticide use in agriculture since the cancellation of chlorpyrifos has not previously been described. we investigated changes in agricultural op pesticide use in california before and after the chlorpyrifos ban and we assessed the spatial and demographic patterns of op pesticide use in proximity to the residences (within 1 km) of pregnant people who gave birth in 2021– the year after the ban was in effect. methods data sources agricultural op pesticide use was collected from the california department of pesticide regulation’s (cdpr) pesticide use reporting (pur) program for all organophosphate pesticides reported in 2016 and/or 2021: acephate, bensulide, chlorpyrifos, diazinon, dichlorvos, dimethoate, disulfoton, ethoprop, fenthion, malathion, methidathion, methyl-parathion, mevinphos, naled, oxydemeton-methyl, phorate, phosmet, tetrachlorvinphos, tribufos and trichlorfon [ 28 ]. data for op pesticide applications statewide, by region (see supplemental table 1 for region descriptions) and by county, were examined for 2016 (4 years prior to the chlorpyrifos cancellation in 2020) and 2021 (the first year where possession and use of 99% of uses were prohibited) [ 8 ]. this time period was chosen to capture op pesticide use before california began the reevaluation of chlorpyrifos in 2017 and a sufficient interval to avoid year-to-year variability which cdpr attributes to weather and changes in cultivation patterns [ 29 , 30 ]. only reports of op pesticide use with a valid location (which identifies the 1.6 × 1.6 km section defined by the public land survey system (plss)), application date, agricultural site, amount of active ingredient in the applied pesticide product, and acres treated were included. agricultural site records for op pesticides applications in the 2021 pur provided information on crops and cultivation patterns. to further refine the location of op pesticide applications from the pur data, the california department of water resources (dwr) 2020 crop mapping dataset was used to identify individual polygons with agricultural land uses within the plss section [ 31 ]. applications of op pesticides were spatially linked to the dwr land use maps through crop type information to more accurately identify where the pesticides were likely applied. birth records from january 1 st - december 31 st, 2021 were collected from the california department of public health’s center for health statistics and informatics birth statistical master file [ 32 ]. information on the date of birth and pregnant person’s address, age, and race/ethnicity at the time of birth were included. residential addresses of pregnant persons were deduplicated for those with multiple births, cleaned, and geocoded, resulting in residential addresses for 390,633 births (93.7% of total births in 2021). this protocol was reviewed, and the need for consent to participate was waived, by the california health and human service agency’s committee for the protection of human subjects in accordance with the us federal policy for the protection of human subjects (the “common rule”). assessment of nearby op use during pregnancy applications of op pesticide use near each pregnant person’s residence were assigned based on temporal (approximate length of pregnancy) and spatial estimates (a one-kilometer buffer zone around the home). the time window of nearby pesticide applications for each pregnancy was determined based on the estimated date of conception through the delivery date. all pregnancies were treated as 40 weeks long when calculating the date of conception and address on the birth record was assumed to reflect residence throughout the entire pregnancy. the 1 km buffer zone around the residence was chosen to be consistent with a cohort study which found associations between op applications within 1 km of maternal address during pregnancy and reduced iq in the children, and is a distance commonly used in other epidemiologic proximity studies in california [ 4 ]. to spatially refine the pur records of op pesticide applications, each application record was matched to one or more land-use polygons from the california department of water resources (dwr) 2020 crop mapping dataset. this method, described by rull and ritz (2003) and used in other studies examining proximity to agricultural pesticide use, links the plss and site locations listed in the pesticide use reports to specific land-use polygons and crop types (defined by dwr to classify land use) through a tiered matching system [ 33 , 34 ]. if multiple polygons with the same crop type were co-located within a plss section, then the related application from the pur database was apportioned among those fields, assuming that pesticides were applied at the same rate across the entire application area. for pur applications that could not be linked to the dwr land-use polygon level, the op pesticide applications were apportioned across the entire plss section. the kilograms of op pesticides applied near each pregnant person’s residence were calculated based on the proportion of intersection between the 1 km buffer zone around the geocoded point and the dwr land-use polygons (or plss section if polygons could not be linked). for example, if 20% of the land-use polygon area fell within the 1 km buffer zone, 20% of the total kilograms of op pesticide applications would be assigned to the pregnant person’s residence. the proportional amount of individual and cumulative op pesticides applied during the estimated time frame of each pregnancy within the area of intersection were summed. we performed chi-squared tests to assess differences between the race/ethnicity and age groups among the number of pregnant people with op pesticide use within 1 km of their residence and kruskal-wallis tests for the median kilograms of op pesticides applied nearby. applications of op pesticide use near each pregnant person’s residence were aggregated by county and region to assess patterns of use across california and to avoid disclosure of individual births in geographic areas with low counts as per california department of health care services data de-identification guidelines. results there was a 54% reduction in statewide agricultural op pesticide use from 2016 to 2021 (fig. 1 ), from 1,001,104 kg to 464,686 kg (p-value < 0.001). in 2016, chlorpyrifos accounted for 41% of all op pesticide applications (by weight), compared to 1% in 2021. use of chlorpyrifos decreased from 408,295 kg in 2016 to 2,769 kg in 2021 ( p -value = 0.002). although chlorpyrifos accounted for 59% of the total reduction in op pesticide use, there were also decreases in applications of most other op pesticides over this time period. use decreased significantly for acephate (68,487 kg to 48,639 kg, p -value = 0.01), dimethoate (110,113 kg to 41,802 kg, p -value < 0.001), malathion (141,840 kg to 108,179 kg, p -value = 0.04), and oxydemeton-methyl (1,707 kg to 0.01 kg, p -value = 0.002). bensulide was the only op pesticide that appeared to increase in total statewide usage by weight from 2016 to 2021, but it was not statistically significant (p-value 0.3). fig. 1 agricultural organophosphate pesticide use (kg) before (2016) and after (2021) the cancellation of chlorpyrifos (2020) * includes fenthion, dichlorvos, disulfoton, tetrachlorvinphos, and mevinphos (2016); trichlorfon (2021); methyl-parathion, methidathion, ethoprop, oxydemeton-methyl, tribufos, phorate, and phosmet (2016 and 2021) full size image comparison of op pesticide use between regions is difficult because regions differ widely in area, arable land, climate and population density. however, temporal changes in agricultural op pesticide use between 2016 and 2021 varied by growing region and county in california (table 1 ). in 2016, the san joaquin valley region used the largest amount of agricultural op pesticides (605,116 kg). op pesticide use in the san joaquin valley reduced 73.9% from 2016 to 2021 following the cancellation of chlorpyrifos, with the largest reduction in kern county (−87%). large reductions in op pesticide use were also seen in most other regions of california, ranging from − 30.7% to −76.0%. only the central coast region measured an increase (+ 0.5%) in agricultural op use during this time. two of the five counties in the central coast region reported an increase in total agricultural op pesticide use from 2016 to 2021: monterey county (+ 26%) and santa barbara county (+ 4%) (see supplemental table 2). in 2021, the areas with the highest intensity of op pesticide use were in monterey county and santa barbara county (central coast), imperial county (southern california), and kings county (san joaquin valley). the op pesticide use in these counties was highly concentrated with areas reporting an intensity of 6250–13,550 kg per township (9.6 × 9.6 km) (fig. 2 ). table 1 agricultural op pesticide use (kg) by california growing region before and after the cancellation of chlorpyrifos full size table fig. 2 op pesticide applications in 2021 full size image although bensulide was the most heavily applied organophosphate (by weight) in california in 2021, acephate and malathion were the most frequently used within 1 km of homes during pregnancy (table 2 ). in total, 29,386 pregnant people (7.5% of all 2021 births in california) lived within 1 km of op use over the course of the pregnancy (use occurred in 2020 and/or 2021 depending on the timing of the birth). the number of different op pesticides used within 1 km of a pregnant person’s home during gestation ranged from 1 to 6. chlorpyrifos was used within 1 km of homes for 3% of the pregnant people with residences within 1 km of op use, representing use that occurred in 2020 during the phase-down and a small amount of reported use in 2021. table 2 percent a of california births in 2021 with op pesticide applications within 1 km of residence during pregnancy, by chemical and region full size table agricultural op pesticide use near pregnant people’s residence differed statewide by race/ethnicity and age groups (table 3 ). hispanic/latine had the highest number (17,579 persons) and greatest proportion of population (10%) and were more likely to live within 1 km of op pesticide use during pregnancy compared to non-hispanic whites (p-value < 0.0001). hispanic/latine people also experienced the largest amount of median op pesticide use within 1 km of residence during pregnancy on average (3.30 kg). younger pregnant people experienced a higher median weight of op use within 1 km of residence during pregnancy and were more likely to live within 1 km of op pesticide use during pregnancy compared to those age 30–34 (p-value < 0.0001). table 3 residence within 1 km of op pesticide use during pregnancy by race/ethnicity and age (all california births in 2021, n = 390,633) full size table the proportion of pregnant people with op pesticide use within 1 km of residence during pregnancy varied by growing region and county (fig. 3 ). in 9 counties, greater than 1 in 5 pregnant people (> 20%) experienced op applications within 1 km of their residence (table 4 ). the majority of these counties are in the central coast region of california; in this region, the median op pesticide use within 1 km of residence during pregnancy ranged from 14 to 69 kg, compared to 2 kg statewide among those with nearby op pesticide use. pregnant people in monterey county experienced the highest use of op pesticides within 1 km of their residence during pregnancy (25th percentile = 17 kg; 75th percentile = 168 kg). monterey county also had the highest proportion of pregnant people (50%) with op pesticide use within 1 km of their residence during pregnancy. fig. 3 percent of pregnancies with op application(s) within 1 km of residence, by county and region full size image table 4 proportion of pregnant people and quartiles of op use (kg) within 1 km of residence full size table in the area with the greatest op pesticide use in proximity to pregnancies, monterey county, bensulide, malathion, and naled were the op pesticides applied the most (by weight) within 1 km of pregnant people’s residence (table 5 ). bensulide had the highest geometric mean by weight (kg), and the highest percentile usage within 1 km of residence during pregnancy (25th percentile = 11 kg; 75th percentile = 2399 kg). the geometric mean for all op pesticide applications within 1 km of residence during pregnancy in monterey county was 42 kg. the mean number of op pesticides used within 1 km of residence during pregnancy was 3 and the maximum was 6. table 5 monterey county op pesticide use (kg) and quartile of usage (kg) within 1 km of residence during pregnancy in 2021 full size table overall, the top five op pesticides applied in the greatest quantity (by weight) in monterey county were bensulide (77,553 kg), acephate (13,263 kg), malathion (12,037 kg), naled (9717 kg), and dimethoate (1938 kg). in monterey county, and in other central coast counties, these pesticides are used predominantly on lettuce, strawberries, and cole crops (e.g. cabbage, broccoli, brussels sprouts). in contrast, crops cultivated with op pesticide use in sutter, merced and tulare counties (that are geographically located in the sacramento and san joaquin valley, together considered the central valley) were tree nuts and citrus; crops cultivated with op pesticide use in imperial county (in the southern part of the state) were more variable. (see supplemental table 3). racial/ethnic disparities in residential proximity to op use in monterey county are consistent with statewide trends, though the proportions of impacted pregnant people are larger in monterey county (not shown). proportionally, five-fold more hispanic/latine pregnant persons lived within 1 km of op pesticide use in monterey county (57%) compared to hispanic/latine pregnant persons statewide (10%). similar to statewide trends, a greater proportion of younger pregnant persons in monterey resided within 1 km of op pesticide use during pregnancy. discussion we found a 54% decrease in overall kilograms of agricultural op pesticide use in california between 2016 and 2021, following the statewide chlorpyrifos ban in 2020. despite this decrease, we found that 7.5% of all pregnant people in california who gave birth in 2021 lived within 1 km of agricultural fields where op pesticides had been used during their pregnancy. in one california county, more than 50% of pregnant people lived within 1 km of op pesticide use. there were considerable disparities by race/ethnicity, age, and region; hispanic/latine, younger people, and residents of the predominantly fruit and vegetable growing central coast region were the most likely to live near op pesticide applications during pregnancy. this region was also the only area where op pesticide use did not decrease from 2016 to 2021. this study is the first to use available data sources to quantify and describe populations vulnerable to adverse health outcomes based on residential proximity to agricultural applications of op pesticides since the cancellation of chlorpyrifos. our finding that 7.5% of pregnancies in 2021 were within 1 km of op pesticide applications is consistent with other california studies documenting the proximity of agricultural applications of pesticides to residential communities [ 4 , 5 , 15 , 23 ]. of the nine counties with the highest fraction of births in proximity to op pesticide use, five (monterey, tulare, merced, imperial, ventura) were in the top 10 agricultural counties in terms of revenue in 2021 and eight were in the top 25 [ 25 ]. total reductions in op pesticide use observed at the state level were not observed in all regions and counties in california. chlorpyrifos was the most widely used op pesticide in many counties in the san joaquin valley in 2016. after the ban on chlorpyrifos, op pesticide use decreased significantly in these counties, and the region with the highest op pesticide use shifted from the san joaquin valley to the central coast. the central coast region did not experience the large reductions in total op pesticide use seen in other growing regions in the state, likely because this region has a different crop mix with lower historical use of chlorpyrifos compared to the san joaquin valley [ 23 ]. as a result, the potential public health benefits from reductions in total op pesticide use following the cancellation of chlorpyrifos are unlikely to be shared across the state. our results show a concentration of op pesticide use in the central coast region overall and within proximity to the homes of pregnant people. some common cultivation patterns may be driving the concentration of op pesticide use in central coast counties. lettuce cultivation was a major user of op pesticides in the counties with the highest op pesticide use and, of the counties where lettuce was reported as a leading commodity in the 2021 agricultural statistics, all but one (imperial) are located in the central coast. notably all of the major lettuce producing counties, including imperial, were among the top counties in terms of op pesticide use near pregnancies [ 25 ]. similarly, strawberry and cole crop (broccoli, cabbage, cauliflower, and brussels sprouts) cultivation are concentrated in central coast counties. lettuce, strawberries, and cole crops are labor intensive, resulting in large populations living in close proximity to fields. in contrast, the central valley of california, which includes the sacramento and san joaquin valley growing regions, op pesticide applications were historically dominated by chlorpyrifos use on tree nuts and citrus [ 23 ]. overall, in these regions, chlorpyrifos applications do not seem to have been replaced by large increases in applications of other op pesticides. however, we did identify three counties, sutter, merced, and tulare, with a higher percentage of pregnant people living near op pesticide applications. in two of these counties, op pesticide use is predominantly on citrus and tree nuts which is similar to the historical drivers of chlorpyrifos use in the region. further investigation is warranted to determine if the use of op pesticides near pregnant people in these counties compared to neighboring counties stems from differing pest control practices or land use patterns. linkage of op pesticide application data with birth records revealed novel findings that differ from just examining the application data on its own. although bensulide was the op pesticides with the greatest total use by weight in the state in 2021, acephate and malathion were used more frequently in proximity to the homes of pregnant people in our analysis. we also found geographic areas of very high intensity of aggregate op pesticide use within 1 km of pregnant people. this could be the result of differential application frequencies and rates between the pesticides and/or differences in land use patterns where housing is in close proximity to multiple agricultural fields. our finding that a large number of pregnant people in california live in homes that are close to op pesticide applications is of public health concern. in a study conducted in monterey county, residential proximity within 1 km of op pesticide use during pregnancy was associated with lower iq in children, with one standard deviation increase in total op pesticide use near the home (237 kg) being associated with a 2-point decrease (15% of a standard deviation) in full scale iq at age 7 [ 4 ]. we found that more than half of all pregnant people in monterey county lived within 1 km of op pesticide use, suggesting that a large population may be at increased risk of iq decrements, autism, or other adverse neurodevelopmental impacts [ 20 , 21 ]. we found an increased likelihood for pregnant people identifying as hispanic/latine to reside near op pesticide applications and to reside near greater amounts of op pesticide applications, which is consistent with other analyses of racial/ethnic disparities in pesticide exposures [ 23 , 24 , 35 ]. racial/ethnic disparities in op pesticide exposures for pregnant people identifying as hispanic/latine were higher in monterey county than the state overall. our study also identified young pregnant people under the age of 20 as a population potentially more exposed to op pesticides during pregnancy, which may compound other pregnancy vulnerabilities for this age group [ 36 ]. our findings add to a larger body of research documenting exposure disparities that may contribute to racial and ethnic health disparities for children [ 35 ]. the analysis of chlorpyrifos use patterns before and after the ban provides some suggestive evidence of the impact of the ban on op exposures during pregnancy. pesticide use data on chlorpyrifos applications in 2015 (pre-ban) found chlorpyrifos use highly concentrated in the san joaquin valley and positively associated with population density, suggesting the potential for residential proximity to chlorpyrifos applications [ 23 ]. combined with our finding of a large decrease in op pesticide use in the san joaquin valley after the ban, there’s evidence that, in some regions of california, the ban likely decreased the likelihood of pregnant people living in proximity to chlorpyrifos applications. unfortunately, we were not able to compare pregnancies in 2016 to 2021, so direct quantitative comparison of op pesticide use in proximity to pregnancies before and after the chlorpyrifos ban is beyond the scope of this study. our study is limited by the accuracy of the data sets we relied upon. there may be errors in the pesticide application data reported to the state of california in the publicly available pur files. however, reporting of pesticide applications is required of all agricultural growers, enforced by county agricultural commissioners, and undergoes extensive quality control checks prior to public release [ 37 ]. not all op pesticides have equal toxicity. relative potency factors are available that compare acetylcholinesterase inhibition across the individual op pesticides [ 38 ]. using these potency factors, several of the ops currently used in high amounts in california are more potent than chlorpyrifos (acephate, dimethoate and naled) and others are less potent (bensulide and malathion) making it difficult to assess how use of other ops has impacted the overall toxicity. there is also uncertainty as to whether potency for acetylcholinesterase inhibition is predictive of developmental neurotoxicity [ 12 ]. in addition, according to the california pesticide use reporting (pur) reporting, 72.1% of the kilograms of op pesticides were applied by ground and 22.6% were applied by air [ 39 ]. although aerial applications are likely to result in increased exposure due to drift, some ground based application methods such as canon or airblast orchard sprayers also increase off site drift [ 40 ]. as a result, accurately accounting for spray drift based on the application method was not possible using the pur data. there may be inaccuracy in our findings stemming from errors in the data reported on birth certificates for 2021 births, but these errors are assumed to affect only a small number of records. there is also possible misclassification error stemming from our assumptions that the address reported on the birth certificate corresponds to the residence during the entire pregnancy [ 41 ]. moves during pregnancy could occur both within the 1 km buffer distance or outside of it, resulting in either under- or over-estimation of the number of pregnancies potentially exposed to op pesticide applications and the amount (in kilograms) of op pesticides applied. overestimation could occur if pregnancies of shorter duration were linked to agricultural applications that only happened in the latter weeks of pregnancy, which seems unlikely to have a large impact on our findings. seasonality of op pesticide applications could account for some differences seen in the kilograms of applications occurring near individual residences; however, this is not likely to impact county and regional differences assuming births are distributed evenly throughout the year. the magnitude of people potentially exposed to op pesticides during pregnancy in california is likely underestimated because we only captured potential exposures occurring as a result of pesticide drift into the home from neighboring fields. op pesticide applications near workplaces, schools, or other areas in the community are also sources of potential exposure for pregnant people, regardless of their home address. additionally, pregnant people in agricultural communities may be exposed to op pesticide applications while working in the fields or as a result of op pesticide residues brought home by other agricultural workers living in the home [ 42 ]. our use of birth record data to identify pregnancies likely undercounts the total number and proportion of pregnancies with residential proximity to op pesticide applications because of the exclusion of spontaneous abortions and stillbirths which have been found to be associated with proximity to agricultural op use [ 43 ]. our analyses show that op pesticide use decreased dramatically in many california counties with the cancelling of chlorpyrifos, particularly in the nut tree and citrus-dominated central valley. however, op use and residential proximity remains high in the central coast region with lettuce, cole crop, and strawberry cultivation. our findings suggest that agricultural transition to non-chemical production and/or pesticides that are not reproductive toxicants could reduce adverse prenatal exposures for a large population in the central coast region of california. conclusions regulatory restriction and phase-out of most uses of chlorpyrifos reduced the potential for op pesticide exposures during pregnancy in some parts of the state, but hot-spots for agricultural op pesticide use remain. the high number of births statewide, particularly in high-use counties, to pregnant people who lived within 1 km of op pesticide use at levels similar to those linked to adverse impacts for the child in epidemiologic studies suggests that regulatory changes to limit the use of or restrict applications in close proximity to residential areas (buffer zones) could have a substantial public health benefit [ 44 ]. additionally, the use of op pesticides in proximity to pregnancies included multiple op chemistries, and our study found many pregnancies were in proximity to more than one op pesticide application. current regulatory practices in california to assess health threats from each individual pesticide may not accurately capture potential impacts of exposure to multiple pesticides with similar adverse health endpoints. data availability the birth certificate dataset

we found a 54% decrease in overall kilograms of agricultural op pesticide use in california between 2016 and 2021, following the statewide chlorpyrifos ban in 2020. despite this decrease, we found that 7.5% of all pregnant people in california who gave birth in 2021 lived within 1 km of agricultural fields where op pesticides had been used during their pregnancy. in one california county, more than 50% of pregnant people lived within 1 km of op pesticide use. there were considerable disparities by race/ethnicity, age, and region; hispanic/latine, younger people, and residents of the predominantly fruit and vegetable growing central coast region were the most likely to live near op pesticide applications during pregnancy. this region was also the only area where op pesticide use did not decrease from 2016 to 2021. this study is the first to use available data sources to quantify and describe populations vulnerable to adverse health outcomes based on residential proximity to agricultural applications of op pesticides since the cancellation of chlorpyrifos. our finding that 7.5% of pregnancies in 2021 were within 1 km of op pesticide applications is consistent with other california studies documenting the proximity of agricultural applications of pesticides to residential communities [ 4 , 5 , 15 , 23 ]. of the nine counties with the highest fraction of births in proximity to op pesticide use, five (monterey, tulare, merced, imperial, ventura) were in the top 10 agricultural counties in terms of revenue in 2021 and eight were in the top 25 [ 25 ]. total reductions in op pesticide use observed at the state level were not observed in all regions and counties in california. chlorpyrifos was the most widely used op pesticide in many counties in the san joaquin valley in 2016. after the ban on chlorpyrifos, op pesticide use decreased significantly in these counties, and the region with the highest op pesticide use shifted from the san joaquin valley to the central coast. the central coast region did not experience the large reductions in total op pesticide use seen in other growing regions in the state, likely because this region has a different crop mix with lower historical use of chlorpyrifos compared to the san joaquin valley [ 23 ]. as a result, the potential public health benefits from reductions in total op pesticide use following the cancellation of chlorpyrifos are unlikely to be shared across the state. our results show a concentration of op pesticide use in the central coast region overall and within proximity to the homes of pregnant people. some common cultivation patterns may be driving the concentration of op pesticide use in central coast counties. lettuce cultivation was a major user of op pesticides in the counties with the highest op pesticide use and, of the counties where lettuce was reported as a leading commodity in the 2021 agricultural statistics, all but one (imperial) are located in the central coast. notably all of the major lettuce producing counties, including imperial, were among the top counties in terms of op pesticide use near pregnancies [ 25 ]. similarly, strawberry and cole crop (broccoli, cabbage, cauliflower, and brussels sprouts) cultivation are concentrated in central coast counties. lettuce, strawberries, and cole crops are labor intensive, resulting in large populations living in close proximity to fields. in contrast, the central valley of california, which includes the sacramento and san joaquin valley growing regions, op pesticide applications were historically dominated by chlorpyrifos use on tree nuts and citrus [ 23 ]. overall, in these regions, chlorpyrifos applications do not seem to have been replaced by large increases in applications of other op pesticides. however, we did identify three counties, sutter, merced, and tulare, with a higher percentage of pregnant people living near op pesticide applications. in two of these counties, op pesticide use is predominantly on citrus and tree nuts which is similar to the historical drivers of chlorpyrifos use in the region. further investigation is warranted to determine if the use of op pesticides near pregnant people in these counties compared to neighboring counties stems from differing pest control practices or land use patterns. linkage of op pesticide application data with birth records revealed novel findings that differ from just examining the application data on its own. although bensulide was the op pesticides with the greatest total use by weight in the state in 2021, acephate and malathion were used more frequently in proximity to the homes of pregnant people in our analysis. we also found geographic areas of very high intensity of aggregate op pesticide use within 1 km of pregnant people. this could be the result of differential application frequencies and rates between the pesticides and/or differences in land use patterns where housing is in close proximity to multiple agricultural fields. our finding that a large number of pregnant people in california live in homes that are close to op pesticide applications is of public health concern. in a study conducted in monterey county, residential proximity within 1 km of op pesticide use during pregnancy was associated with lower iq in children, with one standard deviation increase in total op pesticide use near the home (237 kg) being associated with a 2-point decrease (15% of a standard deviation) in full scale iq at age 7 [ 4 ]. we found that more than half of all pregnant people in monterey county lived within 1 km of op pesticide use, suggesting that a large population may be at increased risk of iq decrements, autism, or other adverse neurodevelopmental impacts [ 20 , 21 ]. we found an increased likelihood for pregnant people identifying as hispanic/latine to reside near op pesticide applications and to reside near greater amounts of op pesticide applications, which is consistent with other analyses of racial/ethnic disparities in pesticide exposures [ 23 , 24 , 35 ]. racial/ethnic disparities in op pesticide exposures for pregnant people identifying as hispanic/latine were higher in monterey county than the state overall. our study also identified young pregnant people under the age of 20 as a population potentially more exposed to op pesticides during pregnancy, which may compound other pregnancy vulnerabilities for this age group [ 36 ]. our findings add to a larger body of research documenting exposure disparities that may contribute to racial and ethnic health disparities for children [ 35 ]. the analysis of chlorpyrifos use patterns before and after the ban provides some suggestive evidence of the impact of the ban on op exposures during pregnancy. pesticide use data on chlorpyrifos applications in 2015 (pre-ban) found chlorpyrifos use highly concentrated in the san joaquin valley and positively associated with population density, suggesting the potential for residential proximity to chlorpyrifos applications [ 23 ]. combined with our finding of a large decrease in op pesticide use in the san joaquin valley after the ban, there’s evidence that, in some regions of california, the ban likely decreased the likelihood of pregnant people living in proximity to chlorpyrifos applications. unfortunately, we were not able to compare pregnancies in 2016 to 2021, so direct quantitative comparison of op pesticide use in proximity to pregnancies before and after the chlorpyrifos ban is beyond the scope of this study. our study is limited by the accuracy of the data sets we relied upon. there may be errors in the pesticide application data reported to the state of california in the publicly available pur files. however, reporting of pesticide applications is required of all agricultural growers, enforced by county agricultural commissioners, and undergoes extensive quality control checks prior to public release [ 37 ]. not all op pesticides have equal toxicity. relative potency factors are available that compare acetylcholinesterase inhibition across the individual op pesticides [ 38 ]. using these potency factors, several of the ops currently used in high amounts in california are more potent than chlorpyrifos (acephate, dimethoate and naled) and others are less potent (bensulide and malathion) making it difficult to assess how use of other ops has impacted the overall toxicity. there is also uncertainty as to whether potency for acetylcholinesterase inhibition is predictive of developmental neurotoxicity [ 12 ]. in addition, according to the california pesticide use reporting (pur) reporting, 72.1% of the kilograms of op pesticides were applied by ground and 22.6% were applied by air [ 39 ]. although aerial applications are likely to result in increased exposure due to drift, some ground based application methods such as canon or airblast orchard sprayers also increase off site drift [ 40 ]. as a result, accurately accounting for spray drift based on the application method was not possible using the pur data. there may be inaccuracy in our findings stemming from errors in the data reported on birth certificates for 2021 births, but these errors are assumed to affect only a small number of records. there is also possible misclassification error stemming from our assumptions that the address reported on the birth certificate corresponds to the residence during the entire pregnancy [ 41 ]. moves during pregnancy could occur both within the 1 km buffer distance or outside of it, resulting in either under- or over-estimation of the number of pregnancies potentially exposed to op pesticide applications and the amount (in kilograms) of op pesticides applied. overestimation could occur if pregnancies of shorter duration were linked to agricultural applications that only happened in the latter weeks of pregnancy, which seems unlikely to have a large impact on our findings. seasonality of op pesticide applications could account for some differences seen in the kilograms of applications occurring near individual residences; however, this is not likely to impact county and regional differences assuming births are distributed evenly throughout the year. the magnitude of people potentially exposed to op pesticides during pregnancy in california is likely underestimated because we only captured potential exposures occurring as a result of pesticide drift into the home from neighboring fields. op pesticide applications near workplaces, schools, or other areas in the community are also sources of potential exposure for pregnant people, regardless of their home address. additionally, pregnant people in agricultural communities may be exposed to op pesticide applications while working in the fields or as a result of op pesticide residues brought home by other agricultural workers living in the home [ 42 ]. our use of birth record data to identify pregnancies likely undercounts the total number and proportion of pregnancies with residential proximity to op pesticide applications because of the exclusion of spontaneous abortions and stillbirths which have been found to be associated with proximity to agricultural op use [ 43 ]. our analyses show that op pesticide use decreased dramatically in many california counties with the cancelling of chlorpyrifos, particularly in the nut tree and citrus-dominated central valley. however, op use and residential proximity remains high in the central coast region with lettuce, cole crop, and strawberry cultivation. our findings suggest that agricultural transition to non-chemical production and/or pesticides that are not reproductive toxicants could reduce adverse prenatal exposures for a large population in the central coast region of california. conclusions regulatory restriction and phase-out of most uses of chlorpyrifos reduced the potential for op pesticide exposures during pregnancy in some parts of the state, but hot-spots for agricultural op pesticide use remain. the high number of births statewide, particularly in high-use counties, to pregnant people who lived within 1 km of op pesticide use at levels similar to those linked to adverse impacts for the child in epidemiologic studies suggests that regulatory changes to limit the use of or restrict applications in close proximity to residential areas (buffer zones) could have a substantial public health benefit [ 44 ]. additionally, the use of op pesticides in proximity to pregnancies included multiple op chemistries, and our study found many pregnancies were in proximity to more than one op pesticide application. current regulatory practices in california to assess health threats from each individual pesticide may not accurately capture potential impacts of exposure to multiple pesticides with similar adverse health endpoints. data availability the birth certificate dataset
