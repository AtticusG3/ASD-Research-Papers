## Abstract

In individuals with cognitive decline, depressive symptoms can affect disease progression and quality of life. One factor that may be associated with depressive symptoms is phosphorylated tau (p-tau). However, the association between p-tau and depressive symptoms remains controversial. The present study examined the relationship between p-tau levels and depressive symptoms not only in terms of total scale scores of the 15-item Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS-15) but also at the item level.
We conducted a cross-sectional survey of patients (
Multivariable regression analysis revealed that higher levels of p-tau were significantly associated with lower GDS-15 total scores (standardized coefficient [95% confidence interval] = -0.28, [-0.48, -0.09]). Furthermore, patients with higher p-tau levels were less likely to have symptoms of GDS-15 Items 2 (Dropped interests) (
Our findings suggest an association between p-tau accumulation and reduced depressive symptoms. However, future longitudinal studies are required to confirm whether p-tau may be a predictive factor for depressive symptoms.

One factor that may be associated with depressive symptoms is phosphorylated tau (p-tau). However, the association between p-tau and depressive symptoms remains controversial. The present study examined the relationship between p-tau levels and depressive symptoms not only in terms of total scale scores of the 15-item Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS-15) but also at the item level.Methods:We conducted a cross-sectional survey of patients (n= 88) with mild cognitive impairment due to Alzheimer's disease (AD) or with AD dementia (ADD), who were strictly diagnosed by a board of psychiatrists and neurologists from Hokkaido University Hospital. All patients underwent lumbar puncture to obtain cerebrospinal fluid for the p-tau assessment. We first investigated the association between p-tau level and GDS-15 total score. Next, we compared the p-tau levels for each item using the GDS-15 with binary responses "none (0)" or "present (1)."Results:Multivariable regression analysis revealed that higher levels of p-tau were significantly associated with lower GDS-15 total scores (standardized coefficient [95% confidence interval] = -0.28, [-0.48, -0.09]). Furthermore, patients with higher p-tau levels were less likely to have symptoms of GDS-15 Items 2 (Dropped interests) (p< 0.001) and 14 (Hopeless) (p= 0.0030).Conclusion:Our findings suggest an association between p-tau accumulation and reduced depressive symptoms. However, future longitudinal studies are required to confirm whether p-tau may be a predictive factor for depressive symptoms.Keywords:Alzheimer's disease; Geriatric Depression Scale; mild cognitive impairment; neuropsychiatric symptoms; phosphorylated tau.---
