## Abstract

Neurodevelopmental delays encompass a wide range of conditions that impair cognitive, motor, and social functioning, often increasing the risk of psychiatric comorbidities. Children with these delays frequently present with disorders such as attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), anxiety, and behavioral disturbances, which can significantly affect development and quality of life. While genetic predisposition has been linked to these comorbidities, growing evidence highlights the role of environmental factors, including prenatal and early-life stressors. However, the interaction between genetic susceptibility and environmental influences remains poorly understood. Identifying specific genetic variants, environmental risks, and their interactions is essential for early detection and targeted interventions.
To investigate the combined effects of genetic and environmental factors on psychiatric comorbidities in children with neurodevelopmental delays, elucidate underlying mechanisms, and inform clinical management strategies.
This retrospective cohort study included 80 children with confirmed neurodevelopmental delays and 40 age- and sex-matched typically developing controls. Comprehensive clinical and psychiatric evaluations, genetic testing (chromosomal microarray analysis and targeted next-generation sequencing), and environmental exposure assessments were conducted. Statistical analyses explored associations between genetic variants and psychiatric comorbidities, environmental risk factors, and gene-environment interactions.
## Results
Psychiatric comorbidities in children with neurodevelopmental delays are significantly influenced by both genetic and environmental factors, with complex interactions between the two. These findings underscore the need for integrated assessments and targeted interventions addressing both biological and environmental contributors to improve outcomes in this vulnerable population.
