## Abstract

To evaluate the clinical efficacy of osmotic release oral system methylphenidate (OROS-MPH) combined with electroencephalographic (EEG) biofeedback and sensory integration training in children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).
This retrospective study included 98 children diagnosed with ADHD who were treated at Longquanyi District of Chengdu Maternity & Child Health Care Hospital between January 2023 and January 2025. Based on treatment modality, 53 patients received OROS-MPH alone (control group), while 45 received additional EEG biofeedback and sensory integration training (observation group). The intervention period was 12 weeks. Clinical outcomes were assessed using the Swanson, Nolan, and Pelham IV Scale (SNAP-IV), Conners' Parent Rating Scale (CPRS-48), and the China-Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (C-WISC). Physiological indices included EEG wave frequencies (θ, β, SMR), cerebral blood flow velocities, and plasma levels of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), cortisol, norepinephrine (NE), and dopamine (DA). Adverse events were recorded.
After intervention, the observation group showed significantly greater reductions in SNAP-IV and CPRS-48 scores, and greater increases in all C-WISC indices compared with the control group (
Multimodal therapy combining OROS-MPH with EEG biofeedback and sensory integration training demonstrates superior efficacy over medication alone in improving behavioral symptoms, cognitive function, and neurophysiological parameters in children with ADHD.

Based on treatment modality, 53 patients received OROS-MPH alone (control group), while 45 received additional EEG biofeedback and sensory integration training (observation group). The intervention period was 12 weeks. Clinical outcomes were assessed using the Swanson, Nolan, and Pelham IV Scale (SNAP-IV), Conners' Parent Rating Scale (CPRS-48), and the China-Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (C-WISC). Physiological indices included EEG wave frequencies (θ, β, SMR), cerebral blood flow velocities, and plasma levels of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), cortisol, norepinephrine (NE), and dopamine (DA). Adverse events were recorded.Results:After intervention, the observation group showed significantly greater reductions in SNAP-IV and CPRS-48 scores, and greater increases in all C-WISC indices compared with the control group (P< 0.05). EEG results showed elevated β and SMR and reducedθactivity. Cerebral blood flow velocities improved more significantly in the observation group. Neuroendocrine markers showed decreased ACTH and elevated cortisol, NE, and DA levels in both groups, with more pronounced changes in the observation group (P< 0.05). No serious adverse effects were reported.Conclusion:Multimodal therapy combining OROS-MPH with EEG biofeedback and sensory integration training demonstrates superior efficacy over medication alone in improving behavioral symptoms, cognitive function, and neurophysiological parameters in children with ADHD.Keywords:Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder; electroencephalographic biofeedback; multimodal intervention; osmotic release oral system methylphenidate; sensory integration training.---
