## Abstract

To evaluate the clinical efficacy of osmotic release oral system methylphenidate (OROS-MPH) combined with electroencephalographic (EEG) biofeedback and sensory integration training in children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).
## Results
After intervention, the observation group showed significantly greater reductions in SNAP-IV and CPRS-48 scores, and greater increases in all C-WISC indices compared with the control group (
Multimodal therapy combining OROS-MPH with EEG biofeedback and sensory integration training demonstrates superior efficacy over medication alone in improving behavioral symptoms, cognitive function, and neurophysiological parameters in children with ADHD.
