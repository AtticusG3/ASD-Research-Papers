R. ChinadSchool of Chemistry and Materials Science, Jiangsu Normal University, Xuzhou, ChinaAbstractThe first diastereo- and enantioselective synthesis of indole-based atropisomers bearing Si-stereogenic centers has been establishedviathe strategy of catalytic asymmetric reductive silylation. By this strategy, a wide range of indole-based atropisomers bearing Si-stereogenic centers were synthesized in moderate to good yields with overall excellent enantioselectivities and good diastereoselectivities (up to 87% yield, 94% ee, 7.3 : 1 dr). This work not only provides a new strategy for catalytic asymmetric synthesis of atropisomers bearing Si-stereogenic centers, but also has realized the first catalytic asymmetric synthesis of indole-based atropisomers with a Si-stereogenic center, which will add an important member to the family of indole-based atropisomers bearing multiple chiral elements. Moreover, this work also presents the first catalytic asymmetric reductive silylation of indole scaffolds, which adds new content to enantioselective C–Si bond formation.This article is part of the themed collection:2025 Chemical Science HOT Article CollectionThis article is Open AccessPlease wait while we load your content...Something went wrong.Try again?---
