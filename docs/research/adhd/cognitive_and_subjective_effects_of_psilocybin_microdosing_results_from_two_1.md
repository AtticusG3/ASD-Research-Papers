## Abstract

Microdosing psychedelics has been widely reported to enhance focus and problem-solving, sparking interest in its potential to treat attentional disorders such as ADHD. However, existing studies largely rely on anecdotal evidence and lack adequate placebo control.
## Methods
Contrary to expectations, microdosing did not significantly affect behavioral or subjective measures compared to placebo. While some initial effects were observed in social cognition, mood, and self-reported cognitive flexibility, these did not remain significant after correcting for multiple comparisons. Regardless of condition, participants predominantly reported their subjective experiences as positive yet negative bodily feelings were enhanced in the active condition. Notably, participants remained effectively blinded throughout the trials.
