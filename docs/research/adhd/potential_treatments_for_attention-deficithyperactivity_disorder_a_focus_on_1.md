## Abstract

Stimulant medications, such as methylphenidate and amphetamine derivatives, and non-stimulant medications, such as atomoxetine, guanfacine, clonidine, and viloxazine, are considered the cornerstones of pharmacological treatment for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). However, a significant number of individuals respond partially to these treatments or are concerned about side effects. This creates a need for new treatment strategies that target alternative neurobiological mechanisms and offer improved tolerability and efficacy profiles.
## Discussion
Recent advances in ADHD pharmacotherapy suggest that approaches targeting monoaminergic systems beyond dopamine and noradrenaline reuptake inhibition may provide therapeutic benefits. Additionally, multi-phase extended-release formulations may improve adherence and enhance symptom control throughout the day. As phase III data become available, these agents have the potential to redefine ADHD treatment paradigms.
