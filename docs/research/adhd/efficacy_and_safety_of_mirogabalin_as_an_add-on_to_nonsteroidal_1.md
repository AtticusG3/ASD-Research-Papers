## Abstract

Lumbar disc herniation (LDH) is characterized by the displacement of intervertebral disc material with compression of adjacent nerve roots, leading to nociceptive and neuropathic pain in the lower limbs and lower back. The Miro-Hers study explored the efficacy and safety of mirogabalin add-on treatment in combination with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) compared with NSAIDs alone. We hypothesized that mirogabalin added on to NSAID therapy may reduce neuropathic pain due to LDH more than NSAIDs alone.
This was a multicenter, 8-week, randomized (1:1), open-label, parallel-group study conducted in Japan between March 2023 and September 2024. The study included participants with LDH diagnosed by magnetic resonance imaging who had inadequately controlled lower limb pain [numerical rating scale (NRS) score ≥ 4] despite NSAID treatment. The primary endpoint was the change in the NRS score for lower limb pain from baseline to Week 8. The secondary endpoints included quality of life, as assessed by the EuroQol 5 dimensions 5-level score (EQ-5D-5L), and NRS score for sleep disturbance. Safety endpoints included treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) and adverse drug reactions (ADRs).
Of the 182 participants screened and randomized, 90 in the mirogabalin add-on group and 89 in the NSAIDs alone group were included in the efficacy analysis. The reduction in NRS score for lower limb pain from baseline to Week 8 was significantly greater in the mirogabalin add-on group than in the NSAIDs alone group, with least squares mean changes of - 3.8 [95% confidence interval (CI): - 4.4, - 3.3] and - 2.2 (- 2.8, - 1.7), respectively [intergroup difference - 1.6 (- 2.4, - 0.8); P < 0.001]. EQ-5D-5L and NRS score for sleep disturbance both significantly improved over the study period with mirogabalin add-on treatment compared with NSAIDs alone [intergroup difference: 0.0653 (95% CI 0.0235, 0.1071); P = 0.002 and - 1.3 (- 1.9, - 0.7); P < 0.001, respectively]. No severe or serious TEAEs were observed. In the mirogabalin add-on group, ADRs were observed in 48.9% of participants, with somnolence (31.1%) and dizziness (18.9%) being the most common.
The addition of mirogabalin to NSAIDs treatment significantly improved pain, quality of life, and sleep disturbance in patients with LDH, with no previously undocumented safety concerns identified.

Clinical manifestations of LDH frequently include widespread pain extending from the lower back to the lower limbs, and severe LDH can cause lower limb dysfunction, such as numbness, paresthesia, and motor weakness in the legs [1,2]. These symptoms can significantly impair patients’ activities of daily living and decrease their quality of life (QOL) [3,4]. Although some cases require surgical intervention, conservative pharmacotherapy with pain medications remains the first-line treatment for LDH in clinical practice [5,6,7].Currently, several medications are available for the treatment of pain associated with LDH. However, few randomized controlled studies have directly evaluated the efficacy of pharmacological treatments for LDH, and the Japanese Orthopaedic Association (JOA) guideline considers the evidence level of these studies to be low [5,6]. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can be used to manage pain associated with LDH; however, some patients continue to experience residual pain despite this treatment. Furthermore, although the anti-inflammatory effects of NSAIDs are effective for nociceptive pain caused mainly by inflammation in LDH [8], previous clinical trials have failed to demonstrate statistically significant pain reduction compared with placebo, highlighting the limitations of NSAID monotherapy for LDH pain management [9,10]. In Japan, pregabalin, an α2δ ligand indicated for the treatment of neuropathic pain, is also used to manage pain associated with LDH. However, reports of its efficacy in patients with LDH are scarce. In two randomized placebo-controlled studies in patients with lumbosacral radiculopathy or sciatica, pregabalin did not significantly improve pain compared with placebo [11,12]. Similarly, another study in patients with acute lumbar radicular pain associated with LDH also showed that the addition of pregabalin to NSAIDs did not improve pain at Week 4 compared with NSAIDs alone [13]. Several studies have reported the effectiveness of pregabalin for chronic lower back and lower limb pain [14], as well as radicular leg pain due to lumbar spinal stenosis [15,16]; however, these were not randomized controlled trials. These findings underscore the need for further evidence regarding effective treatments for pain in patients with LDH.Mirogabalin besylate (mirogabalin) is an oral gabapentinoid and a selective α2δ ligand [17], approved in Japan for the treatment of neuropathic pain based on the results of several phase 3 clinical trials [18,19,20,21]. In clinical studies, mirogabalin demonstrated greater pain improvement in patients with lumbar spinal stenosis and cervical spondylotic radiculopathy when administered in combination with NSAIDs compared with NSAIDs alone, and it also improved pain after traumatic spinal cord injury compared with placebo [20,22,23]. Additionally, while a previous retrospective study reported that mirogabalin reduced leg pain and lower back pain, that study included participants with lumbar spinal stenosis or LDH and had no control group [24]. No prospective randomized controlled studies have investigated the efficacy and safety of mirogabalin for neuropathic pain in patients with LDH. Based on previous findings, we hypothesized that mirogabalin added on to NSAID therapy may reduce neuropathic pain due to LDH more than NSAIDs alone; therefore, the Miro-Hers study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of mirogabalin as an add-on to NSAIDs for the treatment of pain associated with LDH, compared with NSAIDs alone.MethodsStudy DesignThe Miro-Hers study was an 8-week, exploratory, randomized, open-label, parallel-group study conducted at 39 centers in Japan between March 2023 and September 2024 (Fig. S1). A complete list of investigators and institutions is shown in the Acknowledgements section. Eligible participants were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to the mirogabalin add-on group or the NSAIDs alone group through a registration system utilizing the permutated block method. Randomization was stratified based on the numerical rating scale (NRS) score for lower limb pain at study enrollment (baseline; < 6 or ≥ 6). Furthermore, to minimize possible variations and increase reliability, a Site Management Organization was introduced at all facilities to ensure thorough monitoring and oversight, and to standardize procedures, evaluation criteria, and reporting methods.The study was approved by Yamaguchi University Certified Review Board (CRB6180002). The study was conducted in accordance with the Clinical Trials Act in Japan, under which clinical research is only required to undergo a central ethical review, as well as the ethical principles and relevant notifications stipulated in the Declaration of Helsinki (as revised in 2013). This study was registered in the Japan Registry of Clinical Trials under the identifier jRCTs061220102. All participants provided informed consent to participate in the study.ParticipantsAfter informed consent was obtained, participants were screened for study eligibility. Briefly, the inclusion criteria were: patients aged ≥ 18 years at the time of consent; diagnosed with LDH confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), ≥ 1 week after onset; experiencing inadequately controlled lower limb pain (NRS score ≥ 4) despite NSAID treatment; and able to accurately distinguish low back pain from lower limb pain. The permitted symptom was pain, which may be accompanied by numbness, burning sensations, or tingling.The exclusion criteria were: ≥ 3 months from onset of lower limb pain to enrollment; muscle weakness based on a manual muscle test score ≤ 3 [25]; bladder/rectal dysfunction and scheduled for surgery during the study period; lower limb pain or severe pain due to conditions other than LDH; scheduled for surgery and deemed difficult to assess efficacy; history of lumbar spine surgery; creatinine clearance (CrCL) < 30 mL/min, serious underlying disease; receiving prohibited concomitant medications or therapies within 7 days prior to enrollment; and history of mirogabalin use.InterventionNSAIDs were administered in accordance with the Japanese package insert, and no dose changes were permitted during the study period in either treatment group. Mirogabalin was administered in accordance with the Japanese package insert and was adjusted based on participants’ baseline renal function [17]: for participants with CrCL ≥ 60 mL/min, mirogabalin was initiated at 5 mg twice daily (BID) during Week 1, increased to 10 mg BID in Week 2, and maintained at 15 or 10 mg BID from Week 3 onward. For participants with CrCL 30 to < 60 mL/min, mirogabalin was administered at half of the corresponding dose used for participants with CrCL ≥ 60 mL/min.During the study period, concomitant use of gabapentin, pregabalin, duloxetine, opioids, probenecid, cimetidine, and lorazepam was prohibited. Prohibited concomitant therapies included nerve block treatments, intradiscal enzyme injection therapy, and any surgical procedures that could affect the efficacy assessment of lower limb pain associated with LDH. Prior to enrollment, it was prespecified that, in principle, no additional therapies (including physical therapy) other than concomitant prohibited therapies for leg pain due to LDH were to be initiated or modified in frequency during the study period.EndpointsThe primary endpoint was the change in the NRS score for lower limb pain from baseline to Weeks 1, 2, 4, and 8. Participants were asked to rate their pain using an 11-point NRS ranging from 0 (“no pain”) to 10 (“worst pain possible”) [26]. Secondary endpoints included: the responder rate achieving ≥ 30% or ≥ 50% reduction in the visual analog scale (VAS) score for lower limb pain at Week 8; changes in the NRS scores for low back pain and sleep disturbance from baseline to Weeks 1, 2, 4, and 8, each assessed on an 11-point NRS ranging from 0 (“no pain/no sleep disturbance”) to 10 (“worst pain possible”/“sleep completely disturbed by pain”); change in the Neuropathic Pain Symptom Inventory (NPSI) score from baseline to Weeks 2 and 8 [27]; change in the JOA Back Pain Evaluation Questionnaire (JOABPEQ) score from baseline to Weeks 2 and 8 [28,29,30,31,32]; change in the EuroQol 5 dimensions 5-level (EQ-5D-5L) score from baseline to Weeks 2 and 8 [33]; and Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) score at Week 8 (rated from 1 = “very much improved” to 7 = “very much worse”). The NRS score is rated on an 11-point scale, and VAS is rated on a 0–100-mm continuous variable scale. The NRS is characterized by its simplicity and ease of understanding because it evaluates pain by numbers. Therefore, it was employed in patient-reported outcomes where patients themselves record their pain. The VAS can evaluate pain in greater accuracy and detail, so we used the VAS for the responder rate at the time of the participant’s visit to the hospital.The safety endpoints included the incidences of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) and adverse drug reactions (ADRs). ADRs were defined as TEAEs judged by the attending physician to have a causal relationship with the study drug.Daily records of NRS for leg pain, back pain, sleep disorder, and rescue medications were collected through a patient logbook. Other efficacy endpoints and adverse events were collected when patients visited at baseline, Week 2, Week 8, or at study discontinuation.Sample SizeThis was an exploratory study; therefore, based on feasibility considerations, the target sample size was set at 180 participants (90 per group). An intergroup difference in the change from baseline in the NRS score and its standard deviation were assumed to be 0.5–1.0 and 1.2–1.6, respectively, based on the efficacy results of mirogabalin in previous studies [13,24]. The statistical power for the target sample size in the present study was estimated to be 48–99%, with a 5% significance level (two-sided) and an anticipated dropout rate of 15%, assuming the potential scenarios of between-group differences and the standard deviation of NRS.Statistical AnalysisThe modified intention-to-treat (mITT) population was used for the primary efficacy analyses and was defined as all randomized participants who received at least one dose of the study drug. The ITT principle is that all assigned participants are included in the analysis; however, the mITT principle specifies that participants who do not receive any dose of the study drug are excluded. For the primary analysis of the primary endpoint data, a linear mixed model for repeated measures (MMRM) was used to calculate the differences in least squares (LS) means at Weeks 1, 2, 4, and 8 between the mirogabalin add-on group and the NSAIDs alone group, along with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) andPvalues. The MMRM included the treatment group, each time point (Weeks 1–8), and treatment group–week interactions as fixed effects, baseline NRS score for lower limb pain as a covariate, and participants as a random effect. The same analysis was applied to the NRS scores for low back pain and sleep disturbance. Unless otherwise noted, missing values were not imputed. However, in sensitivity analyses and some secondary analyses, the last observation carried forward method was applied.As a sensitivity analysis, the respective NRS scores for lower limb pain at Weeks 4 and 8 were imputed by the last observation carried forward method in the mITT population. Analysis of covariance was then used to compare the differences in LS means between treatment groups, 95% CIs, andPvalues. The same analyses as the primary analysis were applied to the per-protocol set (PPS), defined as all participants in the mITT population who adhered to the study protocol and the package inserts for the study drugs. Differences in LS means between the mirogabalin add-on group and the NSAIDs alone group in LS means of NPSI, JOABPEQ, and EQ-5D-5L scores were calculated by using the same MMRM model. Fisher’s exact test was used to compare categorical variables.The safety analysis set was used to evaluate safety and was defined as all participants enrolled in the study who received at least one dose of the study drug. TEAEs were coded using the Japanese Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities, version 27.1.The significance level for hypothesis testing was set at 5% (two-sided). Statistical analyses were performed using SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA).ResultsParticipantsOf the 182 patients screened, all met the eligibility criteria and were randomly assigned to either the mirogabalin add-on group or NSAIDs alone group (Fig. S2). The mITT population included 90 participants in the mirogabalin add-on group and 89 participants in the NSAIDs alone group. After excluding participants who did not adhere to the study protocol or package insert of the study drugs, 73 and 84 participants were included in the PPS, respectively. The proportions of participants who completed the study in the mITT population were 85.6% (77/90) in the mirogabalin add-on group and 82.0% (73/89) in the NSAIDs alone group. The most common reason for study withdrawal in both treatment groups was patient’s request (n= 6 and 7 in the mirogabalin add-on and NSAIDs alone groups, respectively). Although the analysis in the PPS was a sensitivity analysis, the sample size had sufficient statistical power to estimate effect size.The participants’ baseline characteristics are shown in Table1(mITT population) and Table S1 (PPS). Baseline characteristics were generally comparable between the mirogabalin add-on and NSAIDs alone groups: mean age, 48.1 and 46.8 years; proportion of male participants, 58.9% and 65.2%; and mean body mass index, 24.1 and 23.8 kg/m2, respectively. Most participants had CrCL ≥ 60 mL/min with 94.4% and 87.6% of participants in the mirogabalin add-on and NSAIDs alone groups, respectively. The mean CrCL values were 107.8 and 103.6 mL/min in the mirogabalin add-on and NSAIDs alone groups, respectively. Both groups had comparable baseline pain scores: mean VAS score for lower limb pain, 61.2 and 60.0 mm; NRS score for lower limb pain, 6.2 and 6.0; and that for low back pain, 4.6 and 4.4, respectively. The mirogabalin add-on group had a lower proportion of participants with a longer duration of LDH (≥ 3 months) (3.3% vs. 11.2%) and a longer duration of lower limb pain following LDH onset (≥ 4 weeks) (53.3% vs. 64.0%) compared with the NSAIDs alone group. The most commonly prescribed NSAIDs were loxoprofen and celecoxib.Table 1 Participant baseline characteristics (mITT population)Full size tableThe daily dose of mirogabalin according to renal function is shown in Table S2. Most participants with CrCL ≥ 60 mL/min received 10 or 15 mg BID (68/73, 93.2%), and most participants with CrCL 30 to < 60 mL/min received 5 or 7.5 mg BID (4/5, 80%) at Week 8 in the mirogabalin add-on group.Compliance was checked at 1, 2, 4, and 8 weeks, and most patients were about 75% or more compliant with both mirogabalin and NSAIDs (data not shown).Efficacy for PainThe LS mean changes in the NRS score for lower limb pain (primary endpoint) from baseline to Week 8 (MMRM) were − 3.8 (95% CI  − 4.4 to − 3.3) and − 2.2 (95% CI  − 2.8 to − 1.7) in the mirogabalin add-on and NSAIDs alone groups, respectively (Table S3). The mirogabalin add-on group had a significant reduction in the NRS score compared with the NSAIDs alone group, with an intergroup difference of − 1.6 (95% CI  − 2.4 to − 0.8;P< 0.001) (Fig.1;Table S3). This significant reduction in NRS score for lower limb pain in the mirogabalin add-on group versus the NSAIDs alone group was observed as early as Week 1 and was maintained up to Week 8. Sensitivity analysis also showed a significant reduction in NRS score for lower limb pain in the mirogabalin add-on group (Table S3). Consistent results were also observed in the PPS (Table S3).Fig. 1LS means change from baseline in the NRS score for lower limb pain over 8 weeks (mITT population).

Similar results were obtained in the PPS (Table S4).Table 2 The responder rate of VAS score for lower limb pain at Week 8 (mITT population)Full size tableAs with the reduction in lower limb pain, low back pain also significantly decreased from baseline to Week 8 in the mirogabalin add-on group compared with the NSAID alone group. The LS mean change in the NRS score for low back pain (MMRM) was − 2.5 (95% CI  − 3.0, − 2.0) in the mirogabalin add-on group and − 1.4 (95% CI  − 1.9, − 0.9) in the NSAIDs alone group, with an intergroup difference of − 1.1 (95% CI  − 1.8, − 0.4;P= 0.002) (Table S5). This significant reduction in the NRS score for low back pain was observed from Week 1 and persisted through Week 8. Similar results were obtained in the PPS (Table S5).Efficacy based on NPSI and JOABPEQ scoresThe NPSI total score significantly decreased from baseline to Weeks 2 and 8 in the mirogabalin add-on group compared with the NSAIDs alone group; the intergroup difference at Week 8 was − 8.3 (95% CI  − 13.2, − 3.4;P= 0.001) (Table3). Other subscale scores of NPSI showed similar trends.Table 3 NPSI score (mITT population)Full size tableThe JOABPEQ score for low back pain significantly increased from baseline to Weeks 2 and 8 in the mirogabalin add-on group compared with the NSAIDs alone group: the intergroup difference at Week 8 in the JOABPEQ score for low back pain was 14.3 (95% CI 4.5 to 24.1;P= 0.004) (Table4).

This significant reduction in the NRS score for sleep disturbance was observed from Week 1 and was maintained through Week 8.The proportions of participants with PGIC scores ≤ 2 (indicating “much improved” or better) and ≤ 3 (indicating “minimally improved” or better) at Week 8 were significantly higher in the mirogabalin add-on group compared with the NSAIDs alone group: PGIC score ≤ 2, 68.0% versus 48.6%,P= 0.020 and PGIC score ≤ 3, 89.3% versus 72.2%,P= 0.011 (Table5). Similar trends regarding EQ-5D-5L, NRS score for sleep disturbance, and PGIC score were observed in the PPS (Tables S8 and S9).SafetyThe incidences of TEAEs were 54.4% (49/90) in the mirogabalin add-on group and 10.1% (9/89) in the NSAIDs alone group (Table6). All TEAEs were either mild (41/49, 83.7%) or moderate (8/49, 16.3%) in severity (data not shown), with no severe or serious TEAEs observed in either group. In the mirogabalin add-on group, the most frequently reported TEAEs were somnolence (28/90, 31.1%) and dizziness (17/90, 18.9%), which were also considered to be ADRs. ADRs occurred in 44 participants (48.9%) in the mirogabalin add-on group and six participants (6.7%) in the NSAIDs alone group. In the mirogabalin add-on group, TEAEs leading to study discontinuation occurred in two (2.2%) participants (eczema, rash, and edema), and all were considered ADRs.Table 6 TEAEs and ADRs (safety analysis set)Full size tableDiscussionThe Miro-Hers study is the first exploratory, open-label, multicenter, randomized controlled study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of mirogabalin in combination with NSAIDs compared with NSAIDs alone in patients with LDH. This study enrolled patients with LDH who experienced insufficient pain control (NRS score for lower limb pain ≥ 4) despite treatment with NSAIDs, based on diagnosis by an orthopedic expert, neurologically typical lower extremity pain, and a high degree of symptomatic disability confirmed by MRI. In patients with chronic LDH, factors other than pain, such as psychological and social factors, could have influenced the study results. Therefore, this study included patients with MRI-confirmed LDH ≥ 1 week after onset to ensure enrollment of patients with neuropathic pain, and pain duration ≤ 3 months to minimize confounding factors. These enabled a clearer evaluation of drug effects on neuropathic pain. For such patients, mirogabalin add-on to NSAIDs provided a significant improvement in lower limb and low back pain, as well as QOL. The incidence of TEAEs was higher in the mirogabalin add-on group than in the NSAIDs alone group. Although no previously undocumented new safety concerns were identified, somnolence and dizziness warrant careful monitoring during mirogabalin treatment.The NRS score for lower limb pain showed significant improvement at Week 8 in the mirogabalin add-on group compared with the NSAIDs alone group. This significant improvement in pain was consistent across other validated pain assessment tools, including the JOABPEQ and NPSI total scores. Compared with previous studies investigating mirogabalin in other orthopedic conditions, the present study showed a comparable effect size [intergroup difference in NRS score for pain vs. NSAIDs alone in the present study, − 1.6 (95% CI  − 2.4, − 0.8) vs. − 1.55 (− 2.31, − 0.80) in the Miro-Cens study for cervical spondylotic radiculopathy [23]; intergroup difference in VAS score for pain − 9.9 (95% CI  − 18.0, − 1.8) in the MiroTAS study for lumbar spinal stenosis [22]]. Notably, the pain relief effect of mirogabalin in the present study was observed as early as Week 1, which is earlier than that observed in previous studies [22,23]. Although the exact reason for this earlier pain relief remains unclear, differences in pathological conditions that cause primary pain (i.e., LDH vs. other neuropathic pain etiologies) may account for the discrepancy.The efficacy of pregabalin in treating pain associated with spinal cord disorders remains controversial [11,12,13,14,15,16,34,35], but the pain-relief effects in the present study were generally consistent with previous studies reporting the efficacy of pregabalin [16,34,35]. Importantly, this is the first report demonstrating that mirogabalin exerts a significant pain-relief effect in patients with LDH who experience inadequate pain control with NSAIDs monotherapy.Responder analyses further support the clinical relevance of these findings. At Week 8, the responder rate based on improvement in the VAS score for lower limb pain was significantly higher in the mirogabalin add-on group than in the NSAIDs alone group (≥ 30% improvement, 78.7% vs. 62.5% and ≥ 50% improvement, 72.0% vs. 45.8%). Clinically meaningful analgesia, according to the recommendations of the Initiative on Methods, Measurement, and Pain Assessment in Clinical Trials, is achieved if it results in a decrease in pain severity by ≥ 30% (moderately clinically important improvement) and by ≥ 50% (substantial clinical improvement) [36]. Thus, the observed improvements in the mirogabalin add-on group in this study are deemed clinically significant.In addition to lower limb pain, low back pain significantly improved in the mirogabalin add-on group compared with the NSAIDs alone group at Week 8, with an intergroup difference of − 1.1 (95% CI − 1.8, − 0.4). While the primary endpoint focused on radicular pain, this finding suggests that mirogabalin may also alleviate nerve root-related or discogenic low back pain associated with LDH. Future studies are needed to clarify the mechanism and efficacy of mirogabalin in various types of back pain.The overarching goal of neuropathic pain treatment is not only to reduce pain intensity but also to improve patients’ activities of daily living and QOL [37]. In this context, the present study demonstrated improvements in multiple domains. The EQ-5D-5L score improved by 0.0653 in the mirogabalin add-on group compared with the NSAIDs alone group at Week 8, exceeding the minimal clinically important difference of 0.061 [38]. Additionally, the patient satisfaction level based on the PGIC score at Week 8 was significantly higher in the mirogabalin add-on group than the NSAIDs alone group [PGIC scores ≤ 2 (“much improved” or better): 68.0% vs. 48.6%, respectively].Mirogabalin also provided significant relief from sleep disturbance. At Week 8, the intergroup difference in the NRS score for sleep disturbance was − 1.3 (95% CI  − 1.9, − 0.7), aligning with the results of previous pregabalin studies [13,14,39]. In the mirogabalin add-on group, the NRS score for sleep disturbance improved from 3.3 ± 2.6 at baseline to 0.7 ± 1.1 at Week 8, with an LS mean change of − 2.5 (95% CI  − 2.9, − 2.1). This corresponds to a ≥ 50% improvement from baseline, indicating a clinically meaningful improvement. Patients with pain due to LDH suffered not only from pain but also from sleep disturbances, which affect their daytime daily activities and impair their QOL [1,2,3,4]. Notably, the present study results showed that, in patients with LDH, the addition of mirogabalin to NSAIDs not only effectively reduced pain and sleep disturbances but also improved patient satisfaction and QOL.Despite a higher incidence of TEAEs in the mirogabalin add-on group than the NSAIDs alone group (54.4% vs. 10.1%), the dropout rate was comparable between groups and the incidence of TEAEs with mirogabalin add-on was comparable to that in previous studies of mirogabalin [18,19,22,23]. The most commonly observed TEAEs in this study, such as dizziness and somnolence, were consistent with previously reported safety profiles of mirogabalin [18,19,22,23], and all were classified as mild (the majority) or moderate in severity, with no severe or serious TEAEs reported. These findings suggest that careful attention should be given to these side effects, and that the combination of mirogabalin and NSAIDs is a well-tolerated treatment option for patients with LDH, as it is for patients with other conditions.LimitationsThe present study has several limitations and potential sources of bias. First, the open-label nature of the study may have introduced reporting bias in subjective outcomes such as pain and QOL assessment. Second, the relatively short study duration may limit the assessment of long-term efficacy and safety. Third, no adjustment for multiplicity was performed as this was an exploratory study; therefore, it is necessary to examine this issue in a future study designed for validation purposes. Fourth, this study examined the efficacy of mirogabalin in combination with NSAIDs as a second- or later-line treatment; therefore, the efficacy of mirogabalin monotherapy remains unclear. Fifth, we did not collect data on NSAID dosages. However, there was no notable difference in the types of NSAIDs used in the two treatment groups. Furthermore, the proportions of patients who used NSAIDs per the package insert with no change in dosage were similar in both treatment groups (over 95% in both groups). In addition to this patient background, baseline NRS score was similar between groups. Therefore, the impact of the dosage of NSAIDs on the study results may have likely been very small. In fact, similar results observed in the mITT population were found in the PPS population, which adhered to the dosage and treatment protocol outlined in the package insert, with no changes in the dosage and dosing regimen throughout the study. Sixth, the present study excluded patients with severe renal impairment, those with mild pain (NRS score < 4), and those with only numbness and no pain, which may limit the generalizability of the findings. Finally, as this study was conducted exclusively in Japan, caution is needed when extrapolating the results to other populations.ConclusionsThe Miro-Hers study, the first randomized controlled study in patients with LDH, demonstrated that the addition of mirogabalin to NSAIDs significantly improved neuropathic pain as early as 1 week after administration, and enhanced QOL and sleep disturbance from 2 weeks after administration. No previously undocumented new safety concerns were identified, although somnolence and dizziness warrant careful monitoring. These findings suggest that concomitant administration of mirogabalin with NSAIDs could be well tolerated and may represent a promising treatment option for patients with LDH who experience inadequate pain control with NSAID monotherapy.Data AvailabilityThe datasets generated during and/or analyzed during the current study are not publicly available, but are available from the corresponding author and Daiichi Sankyo Co., Ltd., a study sponsor, on reasonable request.
