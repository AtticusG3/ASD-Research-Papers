## Abstract

In this Personal View, we address key questions to support evidence-based prevention and management of psychotic symptoms that might occur during ADHD pharmacotherapy. We begin by examining evidence showing a significantly increased occurrence of psychotic disorders in individuals with ADHD, independent of ADHD medications (pooled relative risk, odds ratio, or hazard ratio=4·74, 95% CI 4·11-5·46). We then examine whether ADHD medications play a causal role, noting that current evidence does not support such a causal link, at least for methylphenidate. We explore how vulnerability to psychosis varies across individuals with ADHD. Regarding the different steps involved in prescribing ADHD medications, we discuss the importance of balancing potential risks-such as emergence of psychotic symptoms-against the demonstrated benefits of pharmacological treatment for ADHD. Next, we present strategies for screening individuals for vulnerability to psychosis before initiating ADHD medication. We then offer guidance on the clinical management of psychotic symptoms that might arise during ADHD pharmacotherapy, including considerations of dosage and medication type. Finally, we identify key research priorities in this area. Overall, this paper provides an empirical framework, grounded in evidence and clinical practice, to guide the next steps in the field.
