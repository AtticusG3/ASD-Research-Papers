## Abstract

Marcus is a 4-year-old African-American boy with cerebral palsy, Gross Motor Function Classification System level 1, and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), Combined Presentation who presents to Developmental-Behavioral Pediatrics clinic for evaluation because of preschool difficulties. He is very active, jumping up and down at circle time, bumping into classmates, and impulsively hitting other children when they take his toys. As a toddler, his cognitive and social-emotional skills were on track, and he received early intervention for language and motor delays. He qualified for an IEP and transitioned to a district-based inclusive preschool setting with speech therapy and adaptive physical education. Marcus spends the week with his grandparents, and they live in a school district that is well-resourced and has inclusive school and therapy settings. The teachers call parents or grandparents frequently to pick him up. In response to misbehavior, they also put him in a separate timeout area, away from the other children, with a 1:1 aide for the rest of the day. On 2 occasions, he was strapped into a therapy chair for nonambulatory children after biting or hitting another child. Because he does well with 1:1 support, the school has switched him to a special day class with smaller class size, comprised primarily of autistic preschoolers who are minimally verbal. Marcus' parents have just started parent training in behavior management for ADHD after struggling to find a therapist that was covered by their insurance. His mother noticed while volunteering in his original class that other children with similar behavior were not sent home or transferred to a special education class. They are upset with the transfer to the more restrictive environment, but they are worried if they speak up that the district will send him to a less resourced school in the district where the family, rather than grandparents, reside. How would you advise the family to proceed?
