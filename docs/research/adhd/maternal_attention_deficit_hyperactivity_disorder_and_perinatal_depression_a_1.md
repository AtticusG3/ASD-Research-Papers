## Abstract

Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is well-established as a disorder that persists into adulthood and is commonly comorbid with other mental health conditions. Despite increasing numbers of women entering reproductive years with this diagnosis, there is limited research on it in the perinatal period.
To critically appraise the available literature and examine the association between maternal ADHD and depression in the perinatal period.
A systematic review was conducted by searching EMBASE, PsycINFO, MEDLINE and Google Scholar up to August 2024. The available literature was evaluated in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines (PRISMA). The quality assessment was performed using the Joanna Briggs Institute framework, and a narrative synthesis was completed.
