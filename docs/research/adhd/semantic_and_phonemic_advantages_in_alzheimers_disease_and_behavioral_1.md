The FTI was computed using demographically adjusted scores as follows:SVF-PVF/SVF+PVF. Negative values suggest a PA and positive ones suggest a SA. Bidirectional tolerance limits were computed on HCs' FTI values to set the thresholds for defining both a PA and a SA. In patients, correlational analyses were run to test the association between FTI values and disease duration (in months) and severity (i.e., Mini-Mental State Examination, MMSE).Results:In the ADD cohort, an almost equal number of patients displayed a PA (11%) and a SA (10%). In the bvFTD group, 11% of patients presented with a SA, while a PA was less frequent (5%). FTI classification distributions did not differ between these two groups (p = 0.615). In ADD patients, but not in bvFTD ones, the FTI was negatively related to disease duration (p = 0.009). No associations were detected with the MMSE.Conclusions:Both PAs and SAs might be common to both ADD and bvFTD patients; however, in ADD patients, PAs might reflect a longer disease duration and a more severe cognitive involvement.Keywords:Alzheimer's disease; frontotemporal dementia; phonemic; semantic; verbal fluency.---
