## Abstract

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) frequently persists into adulthood and leads to significant impairment across multiple domains. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) has been proposed as a promising adjunctive treatment. We aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of a structured group-based CBT program for adults with ADHD and examine whether cognitive ability and treatment adherence moderate treatment response.
A retrospective analysis was conducted on 24 adults who completed a 10-session group CBT program. ADHD symptoms were assessed pre and postintervention using the Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale (ASRS) and Korean Adult ADHD Rating Scale (K-AARS). Subgroup analyses were performed based on full-scale intelligence quotient (FSIQ), session attendance, and presence of comorbid depression.
## Results
Group-based CBT is an effective adjunct intervention for managing adult ADHD symptoms. Notably, the intervention led to significant improvements in functional impairment, highlighting its potential to enhance daily functioning in adults with ADHD. Tailoring interventions based on cognitive profiles and emphasizing treatment adherence may enhance therapeutic outcomes. Future studies should employ larger sample sizes, randomized controlled designs, and longitudinal follow-up assessments to validate and extend these findings.
