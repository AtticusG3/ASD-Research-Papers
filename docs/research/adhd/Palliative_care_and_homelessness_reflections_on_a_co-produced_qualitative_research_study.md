## Abstract

People experiencing homelessness often don't have access to the palliative and end-of-life care they may need. To understand how this can be improved, it is important to collaborate with people with lived experience of homelessness when carrying out research. This can add more depth and insight from experience and ultimately create better evidence to improve systems, services and experiences. Since the publication of the TIFFIN recommendations, which support co-production in the field of palliative care and homelessness research, we have implemented these within our research. The current paper describes reflections from team members on a co-produced research project exploring attitudes to death cafes among people with lived experience of homelessness. These learnings could support wider implementation of safe, meaningful co-production in this field, with implications for co-produced research in other fields. We provide a summary of how we implemented the TIFFIN recommendations in the death cafe study, and reflections and learnings from all four team members on this process and on working collaboratively. All team members kept a diary throughout the project. These diaries logged thoughts and reflections pertaining to the research process and involvement. Entries were not scheduled; team members could add to them as they felt necessary. Verbal, group reflections were also gathered at several points during the research. The TIFFIN recommendations helped us co-produce a research project. Aspects which were particularly important were building rapport between team members and facilitating equitable approaches to involvement. For this project, navigating institutional attitudes and resistance was not a major issue, which may be linked to the established relationships between partner organizations. People experiencing homelessness often don’t have access to the palliative and end-of-life care they may need. Due to many complicated factors, their end-of-life experiences may not be as good as they could be. To understand how this can be improved, it is important to collaborate with people with lived experience of homelessness when carrying out research. This can add more depth and insight from experience and ultimately create better evidence to improve systems, services and experiences. Despite the importance and challenges of doing this, until recently there has been a lack of guidance about how to do this in a safe and constructive way. In 2024, we published a set of recommendations called “the TIFFIN recommendations” – which sets out things to think about when planning and doing palliative and end of life care research alongside with people with lived experience of homelessness. In this paper, we report our reflections on using the TIFFIN recommendations, and on co-producing research in this field. All members of the research team kept a diary throughout the project containing reflections on what they felt was important to the work they had done that week. As well as diaries, conversations were held at regular intervals to reflect upon the work done recently. These discussions were mainly between the lead researcher and co-researcher with lived experience but were sometimes attended by the wider research team. The paper includes a summary of how we implemented the TIFFIN recommendations, and reflections and learning from these experiences. Each TIFFIN recommendation was relevant and useful to the development of the project upon which reflections in this paper are based. The importance of engagement and rapport and facilitating equitable engagement were particularly important considerations. For this project, navigating institutional attitudes and resistance was not a major issue, which may reflect the ongoing relationships between the partners involved in this research.
