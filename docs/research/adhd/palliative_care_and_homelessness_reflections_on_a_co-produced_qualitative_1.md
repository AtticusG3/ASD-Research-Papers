## Abstract

People experiencing homelessness often don't have access to the palliative and end-of-life care they may need. To understand how this can be improved, it is important to collaborate with people with lived experience of homelessness when carrying out research. This can add more depth and insight from experience and ultimately create better evidence to improve systems, services and experiences. Since the publication of the TIFFIN recommendations, which support co-production in the field of palliative care and homelessness research, we have implemented these within our research. The current paper describes reflections from team members on a co-produced research project exploring attitudes to death cafes among people with lived experience of homelessness. These learnings could support wider implementation of safe, meaningful co-production in this field, with implications for co-produced research in other fields.
We provide a summary of how we implemented the TIFFIN recommendations in the death cafe study, and reflections and learnings from all four team members on this process and on working collaboratively. All team members kept a diary throughout the project. These diaries logged thoughts and reflections pertaining to the research process and involvement. Entries were not scheduled; team members could add to them as they felt necessary. Verbal, group reflections were also gathered at several points during the research.
The TIFFIN recommendations helped us co-produce a research project. Aspects which were particularly important were building rapport between team members and facilitating equitable approaches to involvement. For this project, navigating institutional attitudes and resistance was not a major issue, which may be linked to the established relationships between partner organizations.
People experiencing homelessness often don’t have access to the palliative and end-of-life care they may need. Due to many complicated factors, their end-of-life experiences may not be as good as they could be. To understand how this can be improved, it is important to collaborate with people with lived experience of homelessness when carrying out research. This can add more depth and insight from experience and ultimately create better evidence to improve systems, services and experiences. Despite the importance and challenges of doing this, until recently there has been a lack of guidance about how to do this in a safe and constructive way. In 2024, we published a set of recommendations called “the TIFFIN recommendations” – which sets out things to think about when planning and doing palliative and end of life care research alongside with people with lived experience of homelessness. In this paper, we report our reflections on using the TIFFIN recommendations, and on co-producing research in this field. All members of the research team kept a diary throughout the project containing reflections on what they felt was important to the work they had done that week. As well as diaries, conversations were held at regular intervals to reflect upon the work done recently. These discussions were mainly between the lead researcher and co-researcher with lived experience but were sometimes attended by the wider research team. The paper includes a summary of how we implemented the TIFFIN recommendations, and reflections and learning from these experiences. Each TIFFIN recommendation was relevant and useful to the development of the project upon which reflections in this paper are based. The importance of engagement and rapport and facilitating equitable engagement were particularly important considerations. For this project, navigating institutional attitudes and resistance was not a major issue, which may reflect the ongoing relationships between the partners involved in this research.

This can include people living in transitional, emergency or temporary accommodation, in hostels, staying on friends’ sofas or floors or in unsheltered locations such as the streets, cars, or abandoned buildings [1].It is well known that there is a social gradient to health [2] and that homelessness and health are interlinked. People experiencing homelessness are at a significantly higher risk of dying from many long-term conditions including COPD, strokes, and heart disease, with a particularly high risk of dying from liver disease than the general population [3].In the UK in 2023, 1474 people died whilst homeless; the equivalent of one person every six hours [4]. Importantly, a study looking at 3882 people experiencing homelessness in England found that one in three deaths among people experiencing homelessness were due to causes amenable to being prevented or managed by timely and effective healthcare [5].However, many complex reasons, such as a lack of recognition of palliative need, limited options regarding place of care, systemic impacts of multiple exclusion, and other psychosocial issues, contribute to barriers meaning people experiencing homelessness often can’t access the palliative care support they may need [6]. Therefore, the experience of palliative care for people without secure housing is heterogenous with complex nuances.Furthermore, the experience of homelessness is deeply intertwined with experiences of trauma and loss [7] meaning that conversations around death and dying need to be considered, initiated and continued in ways that reflect those sensitivities [8].Co-production in the field of palliative care and homelessness researchCo-producing palliative and end-of-life care research with people with lived experience of homelessness is key to begin to understand and address this inequity in support towards the end of life [9].Co-production aims to involve the target audience of research through its entire process [10,11]. Rather than only consulting people with lived experience, co-production encourages interactive collaboration whereby people with lived experience form core members of a research team. Co-production can help to reveal unknown unknowns, inform the design and delivery of a project, validate, enhance and direct research and its outcomes to the intricacies of lived experiences [12].Recent literature has recommended increased co-production within the field of palliative care and homelessness research [13,14]. For example, co-production should include collaboration that “combines the expertise in palliative care, care of homeless and vulnerably housed people, and expertise from people experiencing homelessness and their social networks” [13]. Despite the expressed importance of co-production in this area, little guidance to support safe and meaningful implementation of co-production methodologies has been produced [14].The TIFFIN recommendationsTo address this gap, in 2024 we published the TIFFIN recommendations [15,16] (Fig.1). These recommendations were based on interviews and focus groups with people with lived experience of homelessness, and staff supporting them. They provide guidance about how to involve people with lived experience of homelessness in palliative care research in constructive and trauma informed ways.Fig. 1Summary of the themes underlying the TIFFIN recommendations [15]Full size imageThe TIFFIN recommendations includes the importance of evidencing the value of involvement (after completion of a research project) to share learnings and encouraging other researchers to invest time in co-production.Underlying research project: exploring perceptions of death cafés for people experiencing homelessnessDiary entriesThe reflections outlined in this paper relate to a qualitative research study that explored the perspectives of people with lived experience of homelessness, and staff supporting them with regards to death cafés [17]. Death cafés aim to “increase awareness of death to help people make the most of their (finite) lives” [18]. Death cafés present an opportunity for people to come together, share refreshments and have open conversations about death. Importantly, death cafés are intentionally not grief support groups, educational sessions, or a source for information on end-of-life topics [19]. Death cafes were not initially developed with populations of people experiencing homelessness in mind but given that homelessness and loss, in many different forms, are closely interlinked, they may be an interesting vehicle to enable conversations around this topic, for people that wish to have them. We co-produced the death café project, alongside someone with lived experience of homelessness to explore this [17].The death café project involved interviews and focus groups with people with lived experience of homelessness and professionals who worked within the sectors of homelessness and/or palliative care. In this study, homelessness was self-defined by participants and included both past and current experience of different forms of homelessness (including people without shelter, residing in hostel or other temporary accommodation or sofa-surfing). Some professionals had been involved in death cafés for this population previously.The project concluded that death cafés for people experiencing homelessness would require comprehensive consideration and trauma-informed, expert facilitation. The project also recognized that there were limited opportunities for people experiencing homelessness to explore their thoughts around death, dying and bereavement and that the provision of mechanisms to enable such conversations, for those that wish to have them, warrants further exploration.Main textMethodologyThis paper reports reflections from the research team on utilising the TIFFIN recommendations to co produce the death cafe project.Data collectionData collection for both the death café project, and the current paper were conducted online.Diary entriesAll team members kept a diary reflecting on their involvement throughout the project. These diary entries were created electronically. The use of a diary is a well-documented method for the provision of data in qualitative research [20]. It is a tool for prompting, capturing and exploring reflective and reflexive thinking. Diaries can create consistent space for honest feedback, resulting in those involved feeling listened to and that their input is meaningful [20]. All team members used these diaries to log key thoughts and reflections pertaining to the research process and involvement. Entries were not scheduled; team members could add to them as they felt necessary. Prompts were provided to begin the writing process, though team members could write about anything they felt was important.Team debriefs & meetingsDiaries have been evidenced to be most effective when used in combination with other research tools, for example, the diary-interview method [21]. The diary-interview method is where the keeping of a diary is followed by a ‘debriefing’ conversation. Therefore, verbal, group reflections were gathered at several points during the project. In addition the two team members involved directly in in collecting data had regular debrief sessions, summaries of which were recorded in a written format. These were scheduled as necessary but typically occurred twice per month. At the end of the project, an online group session was attended by all four team members. This lasted 1 h and was unstructured: each team member was able to speak about key moments from the project that were important to them, and reflections were shared.Data analysisA framework analysis approach [22] was selected to analyse data generated through diary entries and notes from debrief sessions. The stages in the analysis were based on Ritchie and Spencer’s [23] approach and included familiarization with the data, identifying a thematic framework (the TIFFIN recommendations, outlined in Fig.1; Table1); indexing all study data against the framework; charting and summarize the indexed data; and mapping and interpretating patterns within the charts [23]. Analysis for this paper was led by JC and reviewed and refined by all other members of the research team.EthicsEthical approval was granted by from UCL Research Ethics Committee (ID: 6202/011). Key ethical issues considered for this paper included the possibility of anonymity of diaries in formal academic write up, and sharing and transparency of academic diaries between team members. Following a group discussion, all team members agreed they were comfortable being named as authors in this paper but would prefer that quotes were not reported in a way that would make them identifiable.Key reflectionsApproach to co productionDifferent approaches to co production were considered for the death café project, for example working with one team member with lived experience (an expert by experience – EBE) on an ongoing basis or taking a more consultative approach and working with a larger group of people on a series of specific tasks. To enable consistent involvement, we opted to create a 0.1FTE role, on a 10-month, fixed-term basis for someone with lived experience to be involved in the project, commencing in January 2024.The death cafes project was a partnership between Marie Curie (A UK based end of life care charity), University College London, Pathway and Groundswell. Pathway are a UK based homelessness and inclusion health charity that uses and creates evidence to advocate for systems change to improve health outcomes for marginalized populations. Pathway have an established Experts by Experience programme which supports people with lived experience of homelessness to co-produce research and service development to influence system change. Pathway supported the recruitment of an Expert by Experience and providing ongoing support for them as part of their Experts by Experience Programme.Groundswell are a UK based charity who aim to amplify voices of people with lived experience to create solutions to homelessness and health inequalities. They are very experienced in supporting people with lived experience of homeless to participate in and lead research on a variety of topics. In the death café project, Groundswell recruited to and co facilitated the focus groups for people with lived experience of homelessness.In this section of the paper we reflect on how we consider each of the TIFFIN recommendations in relation to the death café project.TransparencyIn the development of the funding proposal for the death café project, researchers from Marie Curie and UCL met with Groundswell and Pathway to discuss the initial idea and whether each organization would like to work together on it. In this way, input from each organization was gained at an early stage and we were able to have open conversations about the aims and scope of the project and potential role of each organization. A detailed (yet amendable) plan indicating the tasks throughout the project, including potential areas for Expert by Experience contributions and an approximate timescale were developed.Recruitment of an Expert by Experience took place once funding was secured, so that funds were in place to reimburse them for their time. Scope remained to shape the project as ethical approval had yet been sought. From the outset, the topic and parameters of the project, including the duration of the project, the funding available and potential routes for impact were openly discussed, during project set up and throughout. Upon completion of the project, the team remained in contact and they expressed interest in being involved in future projects in this area and following completion of the death café are working with the team on a further project.Importance of engagement and rapportUnderlying the project was the working relationship between all organisations and between team members. Trusting relationships and appreciation for the unique skills and perspectives each organization and each team member brings was the foundation on which the project progressed.Pathway supported the identification of a person to take up the Expert by Experience role. JC and BH attended a scheduled Pathway Experts by Experience Group meeting and outlined the idea for the project and what involvement might entail. Expressions of interest were made via email from interested Experts by Experience. Together we identified a person to be involved, considering factors such as availability, motivation for involvement, and current life situations.Good relationships were established between all team members, these were developed over time. Our experience highlighted that conversing and bonding over personal factors (such as common interests, pets etc.) eased initial nerves and contributed to the development of rapport. In addition, team members were not asked to disclose their lived experiences, unless they wished to – in time, this came naturally. Creating safe, productive relationships enabled any issues arising to be discussed in a way which honors the perspectives of all. It also sets the scene for reflections from all team members on the process and outcomes of the project via diaries, team debriefs and team meetings. Establishing this sense of partnership took time and patience, but was very worthwhile.“I truly value the warmth in the group, a friendly safe space to chat and to ask questions, this helps settle any power struggle or bombardments of one person’s knowledge. The group feels defined in roles, yet on a very clear equal footing.” (research team member).Relationships and rapport were built entirely online; in this case this worked. However, upon reflection an in-person meeting could support rapport development. This may be particularly important for people who feel less confident socially. If possible, we would introduce the option for online versus in person, and offer a mix, or a choice.Through our group reflections, we discussed perceptions of power dynamics within our team. Our TIFFIN recommendations [8] recognise there may always be power dynamics (as the lead researcher ultimately made the decisions, was in control of the grant, holds a permanent paid position etc.), but it’s about minimizing and recognizing them to ensure that all team members feel that their contributions are valid and important. The Expert by Experience ‘s involvement from the very start of project helped this as they were able to influence the project from the outset.Facilitating equitable involvement via person – centered approachesThroughout the project, flexibility was applied, for example changing meeting dates and times to fit other commitments and last-minute changes. If meetings were missed without prior contact, team members would be contacted and support offered where required.Within the death café project nine interviews and two focus groups with a total of 18 participants were completed. All interviews in the death café study were conducted jointly by a member of the research team and an Expert by Experience. The focus groups were organized by Groundswell and co-facilitated by the Expert by Experience. To support involvement in data collection, prior to each interview and focus group, a 15-minute preparation session was held, containing an informal chat, discussion of interviewee, and any practical considerations such as dividing the questions to ask. Following each data collection episode, an informal debrief session was held. This covered any emotional concerns that came up, as well as interesting interview content (which likely formed the beginning of familiarization and theme development).Throughout data collection, questions were split between both interviewers. The Expert by Experience reported valuing being encouraged to contribute prompts to the semi-structured interview schedule, cementing their position as a key part of the team. In addition, they reflected that seemingly small changes (such as introducing the the interviews), made them feel equally involved.Prompts added by the Expert by Experience, as well as their presence at interviews, encouraged consideration of pertinent topics that may otherwise have been omitted. They was able to relate to a lot of the conversation topics and share their experiences (where comfortable) which added depth to the interviews. On occasion, there were emotive, intense conversations during interviews. It was important to be mindful of how each person in the interview may be feeling, and emphasised the importance of the post-interview debrief with the team. This is a benefit of working with a partner organization – if something was raised during the interview or debrief that required further support, there was an additional point of contact.This impact of the Expert by Experience on data collection was also evident in the focus groups:“The impact that [EBE] had on the dynamic of the group was immediate – they knew some participants from working together previously and was able to ease everyone into the conversation. [EBE] was able to relate to the participants while bringing conversation back to the research in a way that wasn’t dismissive or patronising.” (research team member).In the death cafes project, the qualitative method used was Reflexive thematic analysis. JC provided online training about this method and independent analysis of some transcripts occurred, with regular meetings with another researcher compare and combine codes. Collaborative co-analysis completed during meetings was preferable than independent analysis, as it enabled further reflection and discussion of the data during the process.This highlights the need to be flexible. In this project, prioritizing doing fewer, more detailed analysis sessions enabled great analytical insight from the Expert by Experience. Like any role, we are always learning and tackling new challenges. This can highlight how each team member brings different, valuable skills to the team.Another practical way in which this occurred was via changing software used for analysis. As NVivo licenses are costly, and it can be a complicated software to learn with no prior experience, MS Word (using highlighting and comment functions) was chosen as the preferred software for analysis. Though altering traditional academic practice added extra efforts and time to the process, it enabled inclusivity in analysis.Financial recognition of involvementThe TIFFIN recommendations reflect on the importance of financial recognition of the involvement of people with lived experience within research [8]. In the death cafes project, different options for renumeration were explored with the whole team. Different options were explored and each had particular considerations. For example, payroll processes require budgeting for additional costs (for example, National Insurance contributions) and may have implications on other aspects of an individual’s financial situation. Together, we explored each different option and sought advice from other experts to inform an outcome that worked best for the Expert by Experience.Involvement and growth – a trauma informed approachThe Expert by Experience was a key member of the research team. They were involved in many aspects including designing interview / focus group question schedules, receiving research methods training, co-interviewing, focus groups, supporting inductive reflexive thematic analysis, conference poster creation, and reviewing versions of written manuscripts.Training was offered to the Expert by Experience prior to each stage of the research process. To begin, informal training on semi-structured interviewing (carried out online) was provided by JC. The Expert by Experience had some prior experience co-interviewing, but reported that it was helpful to refresh these skills and consider them in the context of the research topic.Training for the Expert by Experience was also provided prior to commencing reflexive thematic analysis (RTA). This involved discussion of the basics of RTA, followed by practical learning which was facilitated working through one transcript together to generate initial codes. This approach ensured a shared understanding of the approach to analysis used in the project, as highlighted in the quote below.“It felt important to express that there was no right or wrong answers / names for codes – emphasizing that the analysis was down to their personal interpretations of the data. [co-researcher] said they wanted more advice on how to name codes, so we practiced this until they felt comfortable.” (research team member).The TIFFIN recommendations encourage consideration of reflective practice with a facilitator who is external to the project. Within this small project, we did not have the resources to provide this, but sought to ensure that through the diary entries, debriefs and team meetings, all team members had time and space to reflect on the project, their involvement and potential for learning and growth. While maintaining the diaries initially took some adjustment for all team members, overall the team reflected that they were a useful way of recording reflections in real time and were seen as acceptable to the team.One of the recommendations within the TIFFIN recommendations for involving people with lived experience in palliative care research, is consideration of the need for reflective practice.Throughout the death cafes project as a team and individually we reflected on experiences of co-research through facilitating open conversations and making space for written reflections but we did not offer external reflective practice.Navigating institutional resistance and attitudesThe organisations involved had collaborated on previous projects in this field. For this project institutional resistance and attitudes presented minimal challenges. For this small-scale project, we had one main point of contact within each partner organization. Representatives from each organization were also on the steering group for the project – enabling an understanding of the project, its progress, the EBE role, and support available to all. For each organization, it was important to understand which aspects of the project were “business as usual” and which were additional tasks related to the project.Application of the TIFFIN recommendations and key learnings from their utilization have been summarized and outlined in Table1.Table 1 Application of and learnings from TIFFIN recommendations in current projectFull size tableConclusionsThis paper reflects upon a co-produced research project which was informed by the TIFFIN recommendations.Reflecting upon the TIFFIN recommendationsThe TIFFIN recommendations were developed to support academic researchers to involve people experiencing homelessness in palliative and end-of-life care research projects as team members [15,16]. Aspects of these recommendations which were particularly helpful for co-producing the death café project were building rapport between team members and facilitating equitable approaches to involvement. The benefits of trusting relationships between organisations were multi-faceted: they enabled identification of potential Experts by Experience, supported recruitment to the project, ensured adequate wellbeing support for the whole team, and supported renumeration. Other research championing the involvement of people with lived experience of homelessness has highlighted links with trusted or community organisations as key to successful co production with this population [24].The development of rapport and trust between team members ensured they felt empowered to share their reflections through the diaries and debriefs. Other research exploring ways to promote involvement of people from marginalized groups in research has also emphasized the importance of rapport and relationships between team members [25]. The methods used to generate data for this reflective piece promoted a sense of agency and demonstrated the teams ability and willingness to listen to each other and adapt processes accordingly, issues highlighted as important in other research [26].Transparency within the TIFFIN recommendations focuses on communication and expectations between academic and lived experience researchers. However, based on our reflections, this could also be extended to any partner organisations involved. Setting clear expectations of responsibilities and capacity, in both directions, can help to understand the “business as usual” of organisations and staff involved. The existing relationships between organisations involved in this project have may have mitigated some of the potential considerations highlighted in the TIFFIN recommendations around navigating institutional attitudes and resistance, as these were not key challenges in this project.The importance of flexibility and making space for adjustments to traditional research practice was also highlighted. Facilitating adjustments from traditional research practice did not, to our knowledge, compromise the robustness of the research – instead it supported meaningful collaboration. Flexibility has been championed in projects that prioritize co production with people with lived experience of homelessness [9,24,27].The TIFFIN recommendations highlight the importance of considering the most appropriate financial reimbursement method in the context of involvement, including the preference of co-researchers. Our reflections also highlight the need to consider how issues like annual leave entitlement or sickness related absence entitlement can be accommodated if vouchers are selected as the optimal form of renumeration. Despite our largely positive reflections on this project, it is important to note recent discussion about the importance of seeing and valuing individuals as people, and not just seeing their lived experience [24]. It is important to ensure involvement is safe and meaningful.This paper has several strengths and limitations. The reflections are from all members of a small research team, with varied backgrounds and lived experiences. Individual diary entries and group discussions were found to work well to capture reflections and experiences across the project. Different or lager teams may have different experiences of co-production and involvement, but we hope that the reflections from our small team are helpful for others looking to undertake similar work.Whilst the TIFFIN recommendations and the current project concern the experiences of people with lived experience of homelessness, there are also learnings that could inform involvement in palliative and end-of-life care research with other populations.Data availabilityNo datasets were generated or analysed during the current study.ReferencesTipple G, Speak S.
