## Abstract

Harness racing is popular in several parts of the world, and the ability to race barefoot is an important trait for success because of its effect on racing time. Barefoot racing is also discussed in terms of animal welfare because not all horses have hooves that tolerate racing without shoes. In Swedish Standardbred trotters (SB) and Swedish-Norwegian Coldblooded trotters (CB), the proportion of barefoot races and the probability to race barefoot in any given race (barefoot status) have low-to-moderate heritability (h
