## Abstract

## Results
REVERSE will be designed as a stepped wedge cluster randomized, hybrid type 2 trial, including an embedded implementation trial. Four cohorts of six acute care hospitals will sequentially enter the trial over 38 months and work to implement first IPC, and, after 1 year, add the ABS practice bundle. Simultaneously, hospitals will be provided basic implementation training and instructed to tailor their implementation, with half of the hospitals being self-guided in their tailoring, whereas hospitals in the enhanced implementation condition will receive time-limited external facilitation in practicing tailoring. Qualitative data will be collected longitudinally to investigate contextual conditions for implementing IPC and ABS locally and how they contribute to tailoring results. IPC and ABS feasibility, fidelity, and sustainability will be assessed together with tailoring fidelity using repeated measures. Retrospective, in-depth, explanatory case studies will be conducted to interpret hospital outcomes.
REVERSE is an extensive and complex effectiveness-implementation trial aimed at investigating tailoring effectiveness. It will contribute to the still scarce evidence base for this adaptive approach to integrating research-supported interventions into routine healthcare settings. By identifying pathways toward strengthening the integration of IPC and ABS practices at European acute care hospitals, REVERSE also has the potential to inform much-needed concerted efforts to combat the growing challenge of antimicrobial resistance in the region.
In November 2021, the REVERSE study was registered with the "International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial Number" (ISRCTN) register under nr.12956554.
