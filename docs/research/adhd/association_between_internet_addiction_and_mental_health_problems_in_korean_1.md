## Abstract

This study aimed to estimate the prevalence of Internet addiction (IA) among Korean adolescents and examine its association with psychiatric comorbidities and mental health symptoms.
A total of 270 adolescents and their parents participated in this study. Parents completed the Internet Addiction Proneness Scale for Youth: Observer Version and the Diagnostic Predictive Scales, whereas adolescents completed the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale for Children, the Screen for Child Anxiety-Related Disorders, and the Youth Self-Report. Group differences in psychiatric disorders and mental health symptoms across IA levels were analyzed.
Of the participants, 86.3% were classified as general, 11.1% as potential high risk, and 2.6% as high risk for IA. The high risk IA group exhibited significantly higher rates of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (42.9%), major depressive disorder (26.3%), and social anxiety (14.3%) as well as greater attentional and social difficulties. Effect sizes for group differences were small to moderate (ε
