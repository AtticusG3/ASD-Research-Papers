## Abstract

Dopaminergic signaling is essential for regulating movement, learning, and reward. Disruptions in this system are linked to neuropsychiatric disorders such as ADHD. ADGRL3, an adhesion G protein-coupled receptor highly expressed in the brain, is genetically associated with increased ADHD risk.

Disruptions in this system are linked to neuropsychiatric disorders such as ADHD. ADGRL3, an adhesion G protein-coupled receptor highly expressed in the brain, is genetically associated with increased ADHD risk.ADGRL3knockout in animals alters expression of dopaminergic markers and induces dopamine-related behavioral changes. However, its precise role in modulating dopamine signaling remains unclear. We investigated howADGRL3knockout affects striatal dopamine release in mice usingex vivofast-scan cyclic voltammetry andin vivofiber photometry with a dopamine sensor.Ex vivomeasurements showed increased electrically-evoked dopamine release across the striatum. Conversely,in vivorecordings revealed reduced task-induced dopamine signals in the nucleus accumbens during an operant fixed interval task. This reduction was not due to impaired dopamine availability, as amphetamine-evoked release was unchanged. These findings suggest ADGRL3 modulates dopamine release in complex ways via different pre- and postsynaptic mechanisms.---
