## Abstract

The present study replicated and extended prior research by comparing the effects of reviewing notes in groups vs. reviewing notes individually on individual final test performance. We also examined the potential interaction between reviewing delay and reviewing methods. Finally, students completed a questionnaire, the results of which reveal how students perceive the effectiveness of group vs. individual reviewing methods. In this experiment, students watched and took notes on two lectures. Following a short or long delay, students reviewed their notes either individually or in a group and were allowed to update their notes during these sessions. After the reviewing phase, students completed a final test for each lecture. We found that individuals added more idea units to their notes after reviewing notes in a group, and this beneficial effect was greater after a longer delay compared to a shorter delay. However, more new idea units did not translate into better cued recall performance. Our findings suggest that reviewing notes in a group helps individuals add more overlooked idea units in their notes, but more factors should be considered when studying the relationship between reviewing notes in a group and final test performance.
