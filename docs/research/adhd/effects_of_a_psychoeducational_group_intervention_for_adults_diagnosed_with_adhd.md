## Abstract

Psychoeducational group programs have shown promising results for people with attention-deficit/hyperactive disorders (ADHD). This pilot study aimed to investigate the impact of a new co-produced psychoeducational group intervention on quality of life (QoL), ADHD-related symptoms, and patient satisfaction. This pragmatic pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) had two parallel arms. Outpatients were recruited in two community mental health centers (CMHCs) in the Central Norway Regional Health Authority. Patients eligible for inclusion were diagnosed with ADHD. The psychoeducation group (PG) received a 10-session psychoeducational group program as a supplement to treatment as usual (TAU), while the control group (CG) received TAU only. The program was developed in collaboration between user representatives and health professionals. While the primary aim of this pilot study was to assess the preliminary impact of the intervention, we conducted exploratory between-group comparisons to identify potential effects on patient-centered outcomes. The primary outcome was QoL measured with the Adult ADHD Quality of Life Scale (AAQoL). Secondary outcomes were ADHD symptom severity (Adult Self-Report Scale, 6-Item) and patient satisfaction (Satisfaction with Information on ADHD and Treatment Scale). We collected data at baseline, pre-, and post-intervention (T0, T1, and T2 respectively). Of 49 patients, 27 were allocated to the PG and 22 to the CG. Between-group comparisons using linear mixed models indicated a statistically significant improvement in QoL (mean difference = 6.90; p = 0.04; 95% CI [0.20-13.60]; Cohen's d = 0.49). Outpatients in the PG reported significantly higher satisfaction with information as compared to the CG (mean difference = 2.14; p = 0.02; 95% CI [0.33-3.95]; Cohen's d = 0.78). However, there were no significant differences in ADHD symptoms between the groups. This psychoeducational group intervention significantly improved QoL and patient satisfaction but not symptom burden in adult patients with ADHD. Future studies should explore the long-term effects of psychoeducational group programs and examine ways to optimize treatment outcomes. ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03337425, 06/11/2017.
