## Abstract

## Methods
Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on NIBS in patients with ADHD were searched. Standardized mean differences (SMDs) for cognitive functions and core symptoms changes were pooled in Bayesian network meta-analyses.
After reviewing 3,976 retrieved citations, a total of 37 RCTs (
The dual-tDCS and a-tDCS may be considered among the preferred NIBS interventions for improving cognitive function in ADHD. Specifically, anodal tDCS over the left DLPFC plus cathodal tDCS over the right supraorbital area improved cognitive flexibility; while anodal tDCS over the left DLPFC plus cathodal tDCS over the right DLPFC enhanced working memory; both dual-tDCS and a-tDCS demonstrated superior efficacy relative to repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) for inhibitory control; further research is needed to investigate TPS for improving attention and impulsivity.
