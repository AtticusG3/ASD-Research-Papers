## Abstract

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a genetically heterogeneous syndrome characterized by repetitive, restricted, and stereotyped behaviors, along with persistent difficulties with social interaction and communication. Despite its increasing prevalence globally, the underlying pathogenic mechanisms of this complex neurodevelopmental disorder remain poorly understood. Therefore, the identification of reliable biomarkers could play a crucial role in enabling early screening and more precise classification of ASD subtypes, offering valuable insights into its physiopathology and aiding the customization of treatment or early interventions. Biogenic amines, including serotonin, histamine, dopamine, epinephrine, norepinephrine, and polyamines, are a class of organic compounds mainly produced by the decarboxylation of amino acids. A substantial portion of the genetic variation observed in ASD has been linked to genes that are either directly or indirectly involved in the metabolism of biogenic amines. Their potential involvement in ASD has become an area of growing interest due to their pleiotropic activities in the central nervous system, where they act as both neurotransmitters and neuromodulators or hormones. This review examines the role of biogenic amines in ASD, with a particular focus on genetic alterations in the enzymes responsible for their synthesis and degradation.
