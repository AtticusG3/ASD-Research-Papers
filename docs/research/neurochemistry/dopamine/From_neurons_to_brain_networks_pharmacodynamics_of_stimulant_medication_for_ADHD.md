## Abstract

Stimulants represent the first line pharmacological treatment for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and are among the most prescribed psychopharmacological treatments. Their mechanism of action at synaptic level has been extensively studied. However, it is less clear how their mechanism of action determines clinically observed benefits. To help bridge this gap, we provide a comprehensive review of stimulant effects, with an emphasis on nuclear medicine and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings. There is evidence that stimulant-induced modulation of dopamine and norepinephrine neurotransmission optimizes engagement of task-related brain networks, increases perceived saliency, and reduces interference from the default mode network. An acute administration of stimulants may reduce brain alterations observed in untreated individuals in fronto-striato-parieto-cerebellar networks during tasks or at rest. Potential effects of prolonged treatment remain controversial. Overall, neuroimaging has fostered understanding on stimulant mechanism of action. However, studies are often limited by small samples, short or no follow-up, and methodological heterogeneity. Future studies should address age-related and longer-term effects, potential differences among stimulants, and predictors of treatment response.
