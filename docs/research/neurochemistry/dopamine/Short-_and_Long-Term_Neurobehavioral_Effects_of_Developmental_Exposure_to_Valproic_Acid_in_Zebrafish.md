## Abstract

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by impairments in social interaction and communication, anxiety, hyperactivity, and interest restricted to specific subjects. In addition to the genetic factors, multiple environmental factors have been related to the development of ASD. Animal models can serve as crucial tools for understanding the complexity of ASD. In this study, a chemical model of ASD has been developed in zebrafish by exposing embryos to valproic acid (VPA) from 4 to 48 h post-fertilization, rearing them to the adult stage in fish water. For the first time, an integrative approach combining behavioral analysis and neurotransmitters profile has been used for determining the effects of early-life exposure to VPA both in the larval and adult stages. Larvae from VPA-treated embryos showed hyperactivity and decreased visual and vibrational escape responses, as well as an altered neurotransmitters profile, with increased glutamate and decreased acetylcholine and norepinephrine levels. Adults from VPA-treated embryos exhibited impaired social behavior characterized by larger shoal sizes and a decreased interest for their conspecifics. A neurotransmitter analysis revealed a significant decrease in dopamine and GABA levels in the brain. These results support the potential predictive validity of this model for ASD research.
