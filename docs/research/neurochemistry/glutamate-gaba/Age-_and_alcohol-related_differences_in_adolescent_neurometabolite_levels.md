## Abstract

Adolescence is a critical period for neurometabolite maturation as well as the onset of alcohol use, yet remains underexplored despite its significance for long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes. We used 3T proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) to examine age- and alcohol-related associations with six neurometabolites in dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) that are involved in key neural functions: glutamate + glutamine (Glx), GABA plus macromolecules (GABA+), total N-acetylaspartate (tNAA), total choline (tCho), total creatine (tCr), and
