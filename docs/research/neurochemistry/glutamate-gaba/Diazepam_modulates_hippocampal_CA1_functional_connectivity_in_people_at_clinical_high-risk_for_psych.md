## Abstract

Preclinical evidence suggests that diazepam enhances hippocampal Î³-aminobutyric acid (GABA) signalling and normalises a psychosis-relevant cortico-limbic-striatal circuit. Hippocampal network dysconnectivity, particularly from the CA1 subfield, is evident in people at clinical high-risk for psychosis (CHR-P), representing a potential treatment target. This study aimed to forward-translate this preclinical evidence. In this randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 18 CHR-P individuals underwent resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging twice, once following a 5 mg dose of diazepam and once following a placebo. They were compared to 20 healthy controls (HC) who did not receive diazepam/placebo. Functional connectivity (FC) between the hippocampal CA1 subfield and the nucleus accumbens (NAc), amygdala, and ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) was calculated. Mixed-effects models investigated the effect of group (CHR-P placebo/diazepam vs. HC) and condition (CHR-P diazepam vs. placebo) on CA1-to-region FC. In the placebo condition, CHR-P individuals showed significantly lower CA1-vmPFC ( This study demonstrates that diazepam can partially restore hippocampal CA1 dysconnectivity in CHR-P individuals, suggesting that modulation of GABAergic function might be useful in the treatment of this clinical group.
