## Abstract

Astrocytes, the most abundant glial cells in the central nervous system (CNS), play critical roles in blood-brain barrier (BBB) maintenance, synaptogenesis, neurotransmission, and metabolic regulation. In response to perinatal brain injury, astrocytes release inflammatory mediators that drive neuroinflammation, disrupting normal brain development. Key signaling pathways, including Janus kinase/signal transducers and activators of transcription (JAK/STAT), nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB), Notch, and glutamate transporter signaling, are activated during this process, contributing to astrocyte dysfunction and neuronal damage. Astrocytes also engage in dynamic crosstalk with microglia, oligodendrocytes, and neurons, further influencing the injury response. Biomarkers such as glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and calcium-binding protein (S100β) highlight astrocyte activation and its role in pathology. By targeting these signaling pathways and glial interactions, novel therapeutic strategies can be developed to mitigate neurodevelopmental and perinatal brain injuries associated with astrocyte dysfunction.
