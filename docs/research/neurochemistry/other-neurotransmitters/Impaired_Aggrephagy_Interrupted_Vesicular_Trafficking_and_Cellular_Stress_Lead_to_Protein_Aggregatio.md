## Abstract

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a debilitating neurodevelopmental disorder with genetic and environmental etiologies involving several brain areas exhibiting abnormalities of cognition and social behavior. Previous work showed involvement of synaptic abnormalities in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex [1]. We hypothesized whether similar synaptic proteins were involved in pathology of cerebellar vermis of children and adults with ASD. Subcellular fractions of synaptosomes from cerebellar vermal cortices of age-, brain area-, and postmortem-interval-matched samples from children and adults with idiopathic ASD vs. controls were subjected to HPLC-tandem mass spectrometry. Analysis of proteomic data in cerebellar vermis of children with ASD showed enrichment of significantly downregulated pathways and proteins (FDR-adjusted The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s12311-025-01880-5.
