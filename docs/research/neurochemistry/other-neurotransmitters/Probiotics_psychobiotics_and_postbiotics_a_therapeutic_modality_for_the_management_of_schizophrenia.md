## Abstract

Schizophrenia is a debilitating, chronic neuropsychiatric disorder, a multifactorial disorder combining genetic, neurodevelopmental, immunological, and environmental factors. Common antipsychotic treatments may be effective against positive symptoms, but still lack when dealing with negative symptoms, cognitive defects, and side effects of medication. Recent innovations show how the gut-brain axis is an important modulator of neuropsychiatric health, identifying microbial dysbiosis as a cause of schizophrenia. This review examines the therapeutic potential of such treatments of probiotics, psychobiots, and postbiotics as an adjunctive or alternative treatment targeting the way of modulating neuroinflammation, neurotransmitter synthesis, experience, and maintenance of blood-brain barrier integrity. Probiotics, which are live beneficial microbes, have immunomodulatory and neuroactive effects; psychobiotics, a subclass that has specific mental effects, modify stress-response systems and neurotrophic factors. Postbiotics, consisting in turn of microbial metabolism like short-chain fatty acids, present improved safety and stability with anti-inflammatory and antioxidant functions. Available clinical and preclinical evidence suggests the ability of these agents to attenuate the symptoms of schizophrenia and cognitive impairment, as well as to increase the tolerability of treatment. Regarding the conclusive presumptions, however, strain-specific variability and inconsistent methodologies confined by the sparse large-scale trials limit them. New technologies of nanocarrier systems, artificial intelligence, and personalized microbiome profiling might provide the best precision of the therapy. In this review, pitfalls in mechanistic insights, progress reports on translational studies, and future research prospects are deconstructively examined to support microbiota-based interventions as promising paradigms of holistic schizophrenia management.
