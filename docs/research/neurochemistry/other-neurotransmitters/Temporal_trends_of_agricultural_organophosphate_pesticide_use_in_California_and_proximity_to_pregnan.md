## Abstract

Organophosphate (OP) pesticide exposure, particularly during the prenatal period, is linked to adverse neurodevelopmental impacts in children. One commonly used agricultural OP pesticide, chlorpyrifos, was severely restricted in California in 2020 but other OP pesticides continue to be used. We calculated the absolute change in agricultural OP pesticide applications (by weight) in California before and after the chlorpyrifos ban (2016-2021) and investigated the spatial and demographic patterns of OP applications within 1 km of residences during pregnancy for all births in California in 2021. Geocoded residential addresses from 2021 California birth certificates were linked with publicly available records of pesticide applications within 1 km. Kilograms of OP pesticides applied during the estimated duration of the pregnancy were proportioned based on the area of intersection between the 1 km buffer zone and land-use polygons with crop data. We found a 54% decrease in overall kilograms of OP pesticide use in California between 2016 and 2021 following the chlorpyrifos ban in 2020. Despite this decrease, we found that 7.5% of all pregnant people in California who gave birth in 2021 lived within 1 km of agricultural fields where OP pesticides had been used during their pregnancy; in one county, more than 50% of pregnant people lived within 1 km of OP pesticide use. There were considerable disparities by race/ethnicity, age, and region, with Hispanic/Latine, younger people, and residents of the predominantly fruit and vegetable growing Central Coast region being most likely to live near OP pesticide applications during pregnancy. A high number of births statewide, particularly in high use counties, were to pregnant people who lived within 1 km of OP pesticide use at levels similar to those linked to adverse impacts for the child in epidemiologic studies. This suggests that regulatory changes to limit use or restrict applications in close proximity to residential areas could have a substantial public health benefit on children's brain development.
