## Abstract

Late preterm infants (34 This phase III multi-centre, parallel two-arm, double-blind, placebo-controlled randomised superiority trial will randomise 478 late preterm infants or twin pairs to receive caffeine citrate (loading dose 40 mg.kg Of early developmental domains, cognition is the most predictive of later neurodevelopmental outcome and intelligence quotient. Prioritisation of the Indigenous population within trials is important. If prophylactic caffeine citrate is found to improve neurodevelopment in late preterm infants, this could have a significant impact on the long-term quality of life and health and wellbeing of this large population of infants.
