## Abstract

Schizophrenia is a prevailing yet severely debilitating psychiatric disorder characterized by a convoluted etiology. Although antipsychotics have been available for over half a century, they primarily mitigate symptoms rather than providing definitive care. This limitation suggests that the neurotransmitter systems targeted by these medications are not the root cause of the disorder. Ongoing research seeks to elucidate the cellular, molecular, and circuitry pathways that contribute to the development of schizophrenia. Unfortunately, its precise pathogenesis remains incompletely understood. Accumulating evidence implicates dysregulated neurogenesis and aberrant neurodevelopmental processes as key contributors to disease progression. Recent advances in proteomics and imaging technology have facilitated the emergence of novel models of schizophrenia, emphasizing the roles of neuroinflammation, sex steroids, and cortisol. This paper aims to organize and map the intercorrelations and potential causal effects between various mechanistic models to gain deeper insight on how these mechanisms contribute to the cause, risks, and symptoms of the disorder. Furthermore, we discuss the potential therapeutic strategies that target these pathological pathways. Elucidating these mechanisms may ultimately advance our understanding of schizophrenia's etiological foundations and guide the development of curative interventions.
