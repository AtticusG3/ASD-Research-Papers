## Abstract

The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (Fifth Edition) classifies attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) as a neurodevelopmental disorder that interferes with human functioning and development. As the clinical presentation of ADHD involves a deficiency in executive function, neurocognitive deficits involving distinctive neuropathological changes must be present for clinical diagnosis. The vesicular monoamine transporter (VMAT), specifically VMAT-2, plays a role in ADHD pathogenesis. In addition, experimental data show that the stimulants (amphetamines and methylphenidate) are first-line treatments for the condition because of their extensive interaction with VMAT-2. The interactions of peptides, bupropion, and nutritional supplements with VMAT-2 receptors have been researched, but more evidence is needed to elucidate their pharmacodynamic properties. Therefore, this literature review evaluated the current pharmacological treatment modalities, peptides, and nutritional supplements for ADHD that target the VMAT-2 system. We obtained relevant studies from several platforms, including the National Center for Biotechnology, Clinical Key, Access Medicine, and PubMed. From the results of these studies, we observed that stimulants interact highly with the VMAT-2 transporter, with omega-3 fatty acids, peptides, and bupropion exerting some modulatory activity on VMAT-2. These agents should be considered for the future treatment of ADHD, although clinical-level research involving human participants is necessary.
