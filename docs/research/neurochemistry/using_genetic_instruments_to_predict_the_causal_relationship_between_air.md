## Abstract

Air pollution has become a significant environmental health issue. Previous studies have shown that air pollution increases the risk of mental disorders through various pathways, such as inflammation, oxidative stress, and disruptions in neurotransmitter systems. However, the potential causal relationship between air pollution and mental disorders remains understudied. Understanding the causal relationship between gene prediction of air pollution and mental disorders can provide new insights for improving public health interventions and policies.
A Mendelian randomization study design was employed. Exposures include PM2.5, PM2.5-10, PM10, NO
Our analysis uncovered a causal relationship between PM2.5 absorbance and depression (β = 0.0361, se = 0.0166; p = 0.0298). This finding was further validated with Firth correction and SPA correction. There is no causal link between other air pollutants and depression. Moreover, no evidence supports a link between air pollution and other mental disorders. Sensitivity analysis suggests the robustness of the results.
Mendelian randomization studies provide weak evidence for a causal relationship between PM2.5 absorbance and depression. This result should be interpreted with caution. Further research is needed to corroborate the complex relationship between air pollution and mental disorders.
