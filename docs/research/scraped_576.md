## Abstract

Maternal obesity increases the risk of neurodevelopmental disorders and cognitive impairments in offspring later in life. Most animal studies investigated the effects of maternal high-fat diet (HFD) from pre-mating to lactation on offspring neurodevelopment and cognitive function. However, the specific impact of in-utero exposure to maternal HFD on the cognitive function in offspring remains limited. In this study, female dams were fed laboratory chow or HFD for 11 weeks: 8 weeks before conception and during gestation. To isolate the prenatal effects, newborns were reared by foster mothers under control-diet conditions during lactation. Behavioral tests were conducted between postnatal days 42 and 56. Our results demonstrate that maternal HFD exposure in utero impaired spatial working memory and spatial memory, and also caused depression-like behavior in offspring. These behavioral abnormalities were associated with reduced hippocampal NMDA receptor expression, diminished neurogenesis, and deficits in hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP). In addition, intrahippocampal microinjection of NMDA receptor antagonists that block NMDA ion channels or compete for glutamate binding effectively reduces hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP), resulting in deficits in spatial learning and memory. Furthermore, microinjection of NMDA into the hippocampus bilaterally activated NMDA receptor signaling, leading to the amelioration of behavioral abnormalities in HFD offspring. In summary, alteration of hippocampal NMDA receptors induced by prenatal maternal HFD exposure is associated with spatial learning and memory deficits in offspring.

## Abstract
maternal obesity increases the risk of neurodevelopmental disorders and cognitive impairments in offspring later in life. most animal studies investigated the effects of maternal high-fat diet ( hfd) from pre-mating to lactation on offspring neurodevelopment and cognitive function. however, the specific impact of in-utero exposure to maternal hfd on the cognitive function in offspring remains limited. in this study, female dams were fed laboratory chow or hfd for 11 weeks: 8 weeks before conception and during gestation. to isolate the prenatal effects, newborns were reared by foster mothers under control-diet conditions during lactation. behavioral tests were conducted between postnatal days 42 and 56. our results demonstrate that maternal hfd exposure in utero impaired spatial working memory and spatial memory, and also caused depression-like behavior in offspring. these behavioral abnormalities were associated with reduced hippocampal nmda receptor expression, diminished neurogenesis, and deficits in hippocampal long-term potentiation (ltp). in addition, intrahippocampal microinjection of nmda receptor antagonists that block nmda ion channels or compete for glutamate binding effectively reduces hippocampal long-term potentiation (ltp), resulting in deficits in spatial learning and memory. furthermore, microinjection of nmda into the hippocampus bilaterally activated nmda receptor signaling, leading to the amelioration of behavioral abnormalities in hfd offspring. in summary, alteration of hippocampal nmda receptors induced by prenatal maternal hfd exposure is associated with spatial learning and memory deficits in offspring. similar content being viewed by others bdnf-nrf-2 crosstalk and emotional behavior are disrupted in a sex-dependent fashion in adolescent mice exposed to maternal stress or maternal obesity article open access 18 december 2023 perinatal compromise affects development, form, and function of the hippocampus part one;

window.datalayer.push({ recommendations: { recommender: 'semantic', model: 'specter', policy_id: 'na', timestamp: 1761044619, embedded_user: 'null' } }); introduction in the u.s., 26.7 and 29.5% of pregnant women are obese and overweight, respectively [ 1 ]. obesity in pregnancy increases the risk of subfertility, gestational diabetes mellitus, hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, preeclampsia, miscarriage, congenital anomalies, labor complications, and associated adverse outcomes [ 1 ]. cumulative evidence indicates that maternal obesity and even abnormal gestational weight gain are associated with increased risks of cognitive impairment, intellectual disability, autism spectrum disorder, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, anxiety and depression, epilepsy, cerebral palsy, and schizophrenia in offspring [ 2 , 3 , 4 ]. epidemiologic studies indicate that genetic factors, pregnancy conditions, postnatal influences (such as lactation or early childhood nutritional environment), and socioeconomic status are positively associated with maternal obesity as well as neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders in offspring [ 5 ]. the developmental origins of health and disease (dohad) theory by david barker explains how fetal programming affects adult health [ 6 ]. the dohad concept suggests that environmental factors, particularly maternal health, can program adult disorders during prenatal and perinatal life. increasing evidence suggests that animal models are crucial for understanding fetal programming [ 7 ]. offspring exposed to a maternal high-fat diet ( hfd) exhibited long-term effects on cognitive functions in adulthood. these effects included diminished learning and memory, reduced sociability, hyperactivity, increased anxiety-like and depressive-like behaviors, and increased reward-based eating and other addictive behaviors [ 8 ]. maternal hfd negatively affects brain development in offspring, and the impact could occur globally as well as locally in specific regions, including the hippocampus, cortex, basal forebrain, hypothalamus, amygdala, and midbrain [ 8 ]. however, these models focus on the effect of maternal hfd during pre-mating, gestation, and lactation on offspring neurodevelopment and behavioral disorders in later life [ 8 ]. most of the effects that have been observed result from a combination of prenatal and postnatal conditions. these combined effects make it challenging to disentangle the distinct contributions of prenatal and postnatal exposures. lactation is a critical postnatal factor for reprogramming neurodevelopment in offspring [ 9 , 10 , 11 ]. for instance, maternal hfd consumption during lactation reprogrammed dopaminergic circuitry in mouse offspring [ 11 ]. however, since pups begin eating solid food around two weeks after birth [ 12 ], it can be difficult to distinguish the effects of breast milk or solid hfd on their neurodevelopment. to address this limitation, the cross-fostering approach allowed us to characterize the effects of prenatal hfd and postnatal hfd. exploring the in-utero exposure to maternal hfd is essential to understanding how prenatal maternal hfd exposure programs the neurodevelopment of offspring and predisposes them to cognitive impairments in adulthood. the hippocampus employs a process known as synaptic plasticity to consolidate and maintain long-term memories [ 13 ]. nmda receptors are an integral part of the glutamatergic neurotransmission system [ 14 ]. nmda receptors modulate long-term potentiation (ltp) and long-term depression (ltd) to support synaptic plasticity, learning, and memory [ 14 ]. in addition to its role in synaptic plasticity, hippocampal neurogenesis occurs during early development, continues throughout life, and plays a significant role in learning and memory [ 15 ]. maternal hfd exposure from preconception through lactation has been linked to impaired hippocampal-dependent cognition [ 16 ], as well as disrupted neurogenesis [ 17 , 18 , 19 ] and synaptic plasticity [ 20 , 21 ]. however, the specific mechanisms through which in-utero exposure to maternal hfd impacts hippocampal neurogenesis and synaptic plasticity in offspring require further investigation. to address these gaps, neonates born from maternal hfd were transferred to icr mice (institute of cancer research mice) and reared on a control diet. this approach allowed us to isolate the in-utero effects of maternal hfd while minimizing postnatal dietary influences. we hypothesized that maternal exposure to an hfd in utero would result in spatial learning and memory deficits in offspring. these assessments may offer valuable insights into the mechanisms involved in addressing or avoiding negative cognitive consequences linked to maternal hfd. materials and methods animal c57bl/6 and icr (crl:cd-1) mice were obtained from biolasco taiwan co., ltd. (taipei, taiwan). mice were housed in groups of 2–5 in plastic cages in a temperature (23 ± 1 °c) and humidity (70%) controlled room with a 12-h light/dark cycle, lights on at 7:00 am. the mice had access to food and tap water ad libitum throughout the experiments. mice were randomly assigned to various diet groups. females were given either a control diet, which contained 13.5% kcal from fat, 28.5% kcal from protein, and 58% kcal from carbohydrate (labdiet 5010*, made by labdiet in st. louis, mo), or a high-fat diet (hfd), which contained 60.9% kcal from fat, 18.3% kcal from protein, and 20.1% kcal from carbohydrate (testdiet-58y1, made by testdiet in st. louis, mo). the subjects were given these diets for 8 weeks before mating and 3 weeks during gestation. female dams were randomly paired with control-diet male at 12 weeks. after delivery, c57bl/6 offspring (p0) were raised by icr dams on a controlled diet. to standardize competition for food and maternal attention, the litters were evenly culled to eight pups, regardless of gender. after weaning, the offspring were fed the control diet throughout the study. all behavioral tests were conducted on mice 6–8 weeks old. to investigate anxiety-like and depressive-like behaviors, open field tests and forced swimming tests were conducted on mice at 6 weeks old. y-maze and object location task were conducted on 7-week-old mice to assess working memory and spatial memory behaviors. morris water maze was conducted on 8-week-old mice to assess spatial memory behaviors. ethics approval and consent to participate the institutional animal care and use committee (ncku-iacuc-108189, ncku-iacuc-109061, and ncku-iacuc-110075) at national cheng kung university and iacuc (edah-112001, edah-112016, and edah-112018) at e-da hospital approved all animal protocols, and all animal experiments were conducted in accordance with the approved guidelines and regulations. open field test (oft) the oft is a dual assessment tool for evaluating anxiety levels and locomotor activity [ 22 ]. mice were placed within the central area of a white arena measuring 60 × 60 cm, with a height of 70 cm. the mice were tested in a random order. a video tracking system monitored the mice’s activity over 10 min. we divided the open field apparatus into nine equal squares. the squares near the walls of the open field arena were defined as outer zones, while the central square was defined as the central zone. ethovision xt tracking software (noldus information technology, the netherlands) was utilized to quantify locomotor activity. the open field arena was exposed to light at approximately 150 lux. the oft was performed from 9 a.m.–4 p.m., and all measurements of behaviors in the open field test were carried out by an observer who was blinded to the conditions. forced swimming test (fst) the fst was used to assess depressive-like behavior [ 23 ]. during this test, mice were placed individually in a clear cylinder (20 cm deep) filled with water maintained at 24 ± 1 °c. the mice were tested in a random order. mice were considered immobile when they floated upright with only slight movements to keep their heads above the water. by ‘only slight movement,’ we were referring to minimal movements of one or more limbs that are sufficient to keep the animal’s head above water. this behavior was classified as immobility, distinct from active swimming or struggling. the immobility time was measured by an observer who was unaware of the groups during the final 5 min of the 6-min testing period. we used a lighting level of 150 lux to illuminate the test room. the fst was performed from 9 a.m.–4 p.m., and all measurements of behaviors in the forced swimming test were carried out by an observer who was blinded to the conditions. the animals were recorded from a frontal perspective during the experiments, allowing us to clearly observe and analyze their swimming behaviors and immobility times. y-maze (arm alternation version) briefly, mice were placed in the maze’s center and allowed to explore the three arms for 5 min freely, and the entering sequence of the arms was recorded [ 24 ]. the mice were tested in a random order. the test was conducted under dim lighting, with an illumination level of less than 40 lux. the maze was cleaned with 70% ethanol between trials to remove olfactory cues. the y-maze test was performed from 9 a.m.–4 p.m., and all measurements of behaviors in the y-maze test were carried out by an observer who was blinded to the conditions. y-maze (arm exploration version) briefly, mice were placed in the center of the other maze and allowed to freely explore two arms (familiar arms) for 15 min. in contrast, the remaining arm was blocked (unfamiliar component). five minutes after the 15-min exploration, mice were allowed to explore the whole maze for 5 min, and each mouse’s time spent in an unfamiliar arm was recorded [ 24 ]. the mice were tested in a random order. the test was conducted under dim lighting, with an illumination level of less than 40 lux. the maze was cleaned with 70% ethanol between trials to remove olfactory cues. the y-maze test was performed from 9 a.m.–4 p.m., and all measurements of behaviors in the y-maze test were carried out by an observer who was blinded to the conditions. object location task in the 10-min sample phase, two identical objects were placed near the corners on one side of a plexiglas box that measures 46 × 26 × 21 cm. the box had black walls and a bright yellow floor and was situated in a dimly lit (&lt;40 lux) test room. the mice were tested in a random order. the mice were then placed in the arena and tasked with finding two identical objects. after that, the animals were removed from their cages and placed back into their transport cages. after a 5-min delay, the mice were placed in the chamber for a 5-min test. during the test, one of the objects was moved to a new location. the percentage of time spent exploring the new corner over exploring both objects determines recognition. the maze was cleaned with 70% ethanol between trials to remove olfactory cues. the object location task was performed from 9 a.m.–4 p.m., and all measurements of behaviors in the object location task were carried out by an observer who was blinded to the conditions. morris water maze the circular tank had a diameter of 80 cm and a height of 20 cm. it is filled with tap water, thermostatically controlled at 22 ± 1 °c, reaching a height of 10 cm. a 9 cm diameter platform was submerged 1 cm below the water surface. the test was conducted under dim lighting, with an illumination level of less than 40 lux. the platform was situated in the northwest quadrant, while mice were released randomly from the other three quadrants: southwest, southeast, and northeast. the experiment was conducted once every day for four consecutive days. the probe trial was conducted on the fifth day after the last training session. during the probe trial, the platform was removed, and the time the mice stayed in the targeted quadrant for 30 s was recorded by ethovision xt tracking software (noldus information technology, the netherlands). the duration and path of swimming were documented by ethovision xt tracking software (noldus information technology, the netherlands). the mice were tested in a random order. the morris water maze was performed from 9 a.m.–4 p.m., and all measurements of behaviors in the morris water maze were carried out by an observer who was blinded to the conditions. western blot mouse hippocampi, comprising both the dorsal and ventral regions, were dissected on ice and processed immediately as previously described [ 25 ]. briefly, tissue proteins were extracted from the whole hippocampus of control and hfd offspring at p8w. tissues were lysed in ripa buffer (20-188, millipore) with a protease inhibitor cocktail (roche, basel, switzerland). wb analyses were conducted as described previously [ 25 ]. anti-glua1(mab2263, millipore), anti-glua2 (ab1768-i, millipore), anti-mglur5 (ab76316, abcam), and anti-β actin (mab1501, millipore) antibodies were described previously [ 25 ]. anti-nmdar1 (ab109182, abcam), nmdar2 (gtx134086, genetex), psd95 (ab18258, abcam), synataxin 1a (ab41453, abcam), synaptotagmin (ab13259, abcam), and synapsin i (ab64581, abcam) were used for western blot. immunohistochemical staining to identify newly dividing cells in the hippocampal dg, we used ki67-staining methods as previously described [ 25 ]. the sections were incubated in cell conditioning 1 (cc1) for antigen retrieval and left there for 30 min. slices were incubated in mouse anti-ki67 (1/100) primary antibodies (ab15580, abcam) for 2 h. after washing with pbs, the sections were treated with the peroxidase-labeled anti-rabbit secondary antibody (histofine simple stain mouse max po, nichirei biosciences, cat no: 414341f) for 30 min and then underwent dab detection. the counterstain used was mayer’s hematoxylin. preparation and electrophysiology of hippocampal slices coronal slices of the hippocampus (300 μm) was extracted from adult male c57bl/6 mice following decapitation under isoflurane anesthesia. the dissected slices were recovered at room temperature for at least 1 h before being transferred to a submersion-type recording chamber. the chamber was consistently perfused with oxygenated (95% o 2 and 5% co 2 ) artificial cerebrospinal fluid (acsf) at a flow rate of 3–4 ml/min. the acsf composition was as follows (in mm): 117 nacl, 4.5 kcl, 2.5 cacl 2 , 1.2 mgcl 2 , 1.2 nah 2 po 4 , 25 nahco 3 , and ph = 7.4. extracellular recordings was conducted and analyzed using an axon setup (axon instruments, foster city, ca). all electrophysiological signals was sampled at 5–10 khz by pclamp software (version 11, axon instruments) through a multiclamp 700b amplifier and digidata 1550b ad converter and analyzed using clampfit software (version 11, axon instruments). evoked postsynaptic potentials was induced in ca1 stratum radiatum through electric stimulation (0.02 ms duration) of schaffer collateral/commissural afferents at 0.033 hz using a tungsten concentric bipolar microelectrode (wpi tm53ccins, sarasota, fl). field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fepsps) was recorded with a glass pipette filled with acsf (3–5 mω resistance). the strength of synaptic transmission was assessed by calculating the slope of fepsp. the high-frequency stimulation protocol inducing long-term potentiation (ltp) consists of four 0.5-s trains of 100-hz stimuli separated by 20 s. in each slice, fepsps was monitored for at least 20 min until stable fepsps are achieved. the average slope of fepsps recorded for 10 min served as the baseline of fepsp slope before ltp stimulation. the magnitude of ltp was determined by the average slope of 30 fepsps recorded 50–60 min after high-frequency stimulation (hfs) and expressed as a percentage of the baseline fepsp slope. stereotaxic injections mice were anesthetized and then placed in a stereotaxic frame. the area around the incision was trimmed, and the meninges were treated with 3% hydrogen peroxide. the bregma was identified as the origin, and solutions were injected bilaterally into the dg of the dorsal hippocampus using the following coordinates: (from bregma) anterior = −1.7 mm, lateral = ± 1.6 mm, (from skull surface) height = −0.16 mm. a concentrated solution of 2.0 μl was injected stereotaxically over 10 min using a 5-ml 33 s-gauge hamilton syringe. the needle was kept in place for 10 min and then slowly removed. the skin was closed using a silk suture. the mice were monitored during their recovery period. after a seven-day recovery period following cannulation, mice received microinjections of drugs prior to behavioral assessments. saline, mk-801 (0.5 mg/kg, once/day), dl-apv (0.5μg/kg, once/day), or nmda (1 μm, once/day), was microinjected into the dg of the dorsal hippocampus once daily for 12 days. in this experimental setting, we employed daily acute administration of the drugs to investigate their long-lasting effects on behavioral responses. behavioral tests were performed one week after the injection. mk-801(cat no:10009019,) and nmda (cat no:14581) were purchased from cayman. dl-apv (cat no: hb0252) was purchased from hello bio. statistics data were expressed as means ± sem. the analysis was performed using graphpad prism 6 (graphpad, la jolla, ca, usa), jasp (version 0.19.3.0; jasp team) and r software version 4.4.2. data were initially tested for normal distribution using the shapiro-wilk test and for homogeneity of variance using levene’s test (supplementary table 1 ). for data sets that met the criteria for parametric statistics, appropriate tests included student’s t-test (two-tailed), one-way anova with tukey’s post hoc test, or two-way anova with sidak’s post hoc test. for non-parametric data sets, we used the mann-whitney u test (two-tailed) for 2-group comparison, kruskal-wallis test with dunn’s post hoc tests, or the scheirer–ray–hare test followed by wilcoxon rank-sum tests with bonferroni correction for pairwise comparisons. the rout method with a q-coefficient of 1% was applied to identify potential outliers. results a mouse model investigating the effects of maternal hfd on the cognitive behaviors of offspring to investigate the impact of intrauterine exposure to maternal hfd, which conveys risks for cognitive behaviors in offspring, the experimental flowchart was shown in fig. 1a . female dams were fed the control or high-fat diet (hfd) for eight weeks. after eight weeks of dietary intervention, the dams fed an hfd had a significantly increased body weight compared to those fed the control diet (fig. 1b ). to assess the impact of maternal diet, female dams were paired with control-diet male dams at 12 weeks, and pregnant dams were maintained on control-diet or hfd throughout gestation. to prevent the effect of maternal hfd exposure during lactation, newborns were reared by foster icr mothers under control-diet conditions for the lactation period. after weaning, the mice were fed a control diet. mouse behavioral changes were tested, as shown in fig. 1a . fig. 1: maternal hfd exposure resulted in impaired spatial learning and memory in offspring. a

post hoc test: ctrl vs. mk801, p &lt; 0.05; ctrl vs. dl-apv, p &lt; 0.01; mk801 vs. dl-apv, n.s.] (fig. 5g ). to our knowledge, this is the first report of the impact of intradorsal hippocampal (ca1) injection of mk-801 and dl-apv effectively reducing hippocampal ltp, resulting in deficits in spatial learning and memory. these findings prove that nmda receptors in the hippocampus play a role in spatial learning and memory. although this approach offered insights into hippocampal nmda receptor signaling and neurocognitive deficits, it failed to address potential mechanisms acting during critical windows of neurodevelopment. fig. 5: effects of nmda receptor antagonists on the hippocampal ca1 ltp and spatial memory. a timeline of the experiment. the model was created using biorender. b the y-maze task with a blocked arm test examined the effects of mk-801 or dl-apv on spatial memory in mice. the data displays the time spent in the unfamiliar arm as the mean ± sem with individual value plots.

environment plays a crucial role in fetal programming per the dohad hypothesis [ 6 ]. in fig. s1 , we provided our model for maternal hfd exposure in utero impaired behavior in offspring. we provide evidence that feeding female mice an hfd during pre-mating and gestation is sufficient to impair spatial working memory and spatial memory, to cause depression-like behavior in offspring. our findings indicated the long-term effects of maternal hfd on neurocognitive functions, indicating that prenatal maternal hfd exposure can make individuals more susceptible to cognitive impairments later in life. changes in hippocampal synaptic plasticity were identified through electrophysiological studies. further, activation of nmda signaling rescues spatial learning and memory deficits in offspring of maternal hfd. animal behavioral testing results depend on the sex, age, and timeline of maternal hfd model implementation. previous studies failed to distinguish between the prenatal and postnatal effects of maternal hfd on offspring. in our animal model, newborns were reared by foster icr mothers with excellent maternal characteristics (e.g. nest building, pup retrieval behavior, nursing and grooming of the pups) [ 37 ] on a control diet during the lactation period, offering new insights into several aspects. pre-conception and pregnancy are critical periods for appropriately programming epigenetic mechanisms [ 38 ]. our experimental design using icr foster mothers during lactation provides a clearer understanding of the bona-fide in utero effects. notably, hfd negatively affects maternal behavior, such as nest building and pup retrieval [ 39 ]. in c57bl/6 mice, maternal hfd negatively affects mammopoiesis, milk production, and pup retrieval [ 40 ]. in our model, litters at gestation day (gd) 18.5 were significantly smaller in hfd mice than in control mice (fig. s2a ), indicating that the fecundity of hfd-fed mothers was compromised. consistent with previous studies [ 40 , 41 , 42 ], our maternal hfd model timeline was associated with poor pup survival in c57bl/6 mice (fig. s2b ). fostering hfd pups with icr mothers significantly improved their survival rates, but the number of live pups remained lower than that of the control group (fig. s2b ). therefore, foster icr mothers could protect newborns from inadequate maternal care in our maternal hfd model during lactation. we showed that in-utero exposure to maternal hfd resulted in persistent behavioral deficits even after returning to a normal diet during lactation and after weaning. nmda receptors comprise two nmdar1 subunits and two nmdar2 or nmdar3 subunits [ 43 ]. the role of nmda receptors in plasticity mechanisms related to recognition memory processes in the perirhinal cortex, hippocampus, temporal association cortex, and mpfc has been well-established [ 44 ]. our findings indicate maternal exposure to hfd in utero diminishes hippocampal nmda receptor and psd95 protein expression in the offspring, which displays deficits in hippocampal ltp. previous studies indicated that offspring of maternal hfd during pregnancy and lactation displayed impaired nmdar2a/ nmdar2b ratio in the hippocampus [ 45 , 46 ], and impaired ltp at ca3-ca1 synapses in offspring [ 20 , 21 ]. the precise mechanism by which prenatal exposure to hfd reduces hippocampal nmda receptor expression remains to be explored. in one study, maternal hfd alters fetal brain microrna expression which is associated with decreased nmdar expression [ 45 ]. in another study, maternal hfd negatively affects the synaptic plasticity of their offspring by epigenetically suppressing the expression of bdnf in the hippocampus [ 21 ]. more studies are required to decipher the mechanism by which maternal obesity affects nmda receptor expression in male offspring. for the first time, we provide evidence that daily acute administration of nmda into the hippocampal dg of hfd offspring activates nmda receptor signaling, producing a long-lasting effect that counteracts reduced ltp and improves cognitive function and memory impairments. in line with prior studies, our study provides clear evidence that prenatal maternal hfd exposure impacts the synaptic plasticity and cognitive behavior of offspring through the hippocampal nmda receptor pathways. our findings indicate that nmda receptors are necessary for the effects of maternal hfd on offspring learning and memory. antagonist experiments demonstrate that blocking nmda receptor signaling mitigates hippocampus-dependent tasks, underscoring their necessity in neurocognitive alterations observed in offspring exposed to maternal hfd. conversely, nmda receptor activation through nmda injections was sufficient to rescue hippocampus-dependent tasks in maternal hfd offspring, further supporting the involvement of nmda receptor activity in this process. these results suggest that nmda receptor dysregulation may underlie the learning and memory impairments associated with maternal hfd. collectively, our findings underscore the pivotal role of nmda receptors in the interplay between maternal diet and offspring cognitive function. the concentrations of nmda receptor antagonists and agonists were chosen based on prior research showing their effectiveness in modulating nmda receptor activity in vivo. these concentrations, while not physiological, are widely utilized as pharmacological tools to evaluate the role of nmda receptors in memory and synaptic plasticity. regarding the nmda concentration used for activation, the dose was chosen based on prior studies showing that this concentration effectively activates nmda receptors in vivo [ 36 ]. the potential mechanism underlying the long-term effects of acute nmda receptor activation involves synaptic plasticity, including ltp, which is critical for sustained changes in neuronal function and behavior. nmda receptor activation is well-known to facilitate calcium influx, triggering intracellular signaling cascades and gene transcription necessary for enduring synaptic modifications [ 47 ]. impaired neurogenesis in the adult hippocampus has been linked to learning and memory [ 48 ]. research has shown that maternal hfd consumed from preconception through lactation significantly impaired hippocampal neurogenesis in offspring [ 17 , 18 , 19 ]. in this study, we also found that in utero exposure to hfd leads to impaired hippocampal neurogenesis in offspring. although synaptic dysfunction and impaired neurogenesis may jointly contribute to neurobehavioral deficits in the offspring [ 49 , 50 ], our results indicate that daily acute administration of nmda into the hippocampal dg is sufficient to produce a long-lasting effect in rescuing cognitive function. these data suggested a potential mechanism through which nmda enhances synaptic plasticity or compensates for deficits in neurogenesis. furthermore, exploring the connection between synaptic plasticity and neurogenesis will provide a clearer understanding of the mechanisms behind the observed outcomes. epidemiological studies have revealed an association between maternal obesity and depression in their children [ 51 ]. previous research, including our own, has shown that maternal hfd can influence the offspring’s susceptibility to depression-like behavior [ 52 , 53 ]. a possible mechanism for this association is that maternal hfd impairs the development of the serotonergic and dopaminergic systems in offspring, which are crucial for regulating emotional behavior [ 51 , 54 , 55 ]. notably, these neurotransmitter systems also play a role in learning and memory [ 56 , 57 ]. serotonin enhances the activation of nmda receptors and facilitates the expression of ltp in the ca1 region [ 58 ]. dopamine modulates synaptic strength in neuronal circuits by influencing neuronal populations that drive ltp and ltd [ 59 ]. together, these results showed that maternal obesity has multiple effects on offspring’s neurodevelopment and leads to cognitive defects. in humans, sexual dimorphism exists, with male predominance in cases of adhd and female predominance in cases of overweight and obesity [ 11 , 60 , 61 ]. previous work already showed the sexually dimorphic effect of maternal obesity on neurodevelopment. neuroinflammatory responses, epigenetic regulation, gene expression patterns, and microglia and astrocyte cell function may jointly contribute to sexual dimorphism in neurodevelopmental disorders [ 8 , 62 , 63 , 64 ]. to examine the sexual differences in our model, we conducted a two-way anova with maternal diet and sex as factors to evaluate potential interactions. the analysis revealed no significant interaction, indicating that maternal diet effects were not strictly sex-dependent. however, male offspring exposed to maternal hfd showed substantial reductions in hippocampal psd95, nmdar1, and nmdar2 expression, along with decreased neurogenesis and impaired water maze performance (supplementary table 2 ). the mean differences in these measures were larger in males than in females, suggesting greater susceptibility of male offspring to maternal hfd-induced cognitive dysfunction (supplementary table 2 ). these findings highlight potential biological differences between sexes, warranting further research to elucidate the underlying mechanisms. in conclusion, our model enabled us to rigorously investigate the mechanisms underlying cognitive dysfunction in response to maternal hfd in utero. this is concerning because there is evidence of an increase in obesity among pregnant women and in the prevalence of childhood cognitive impairment [ 65 ]. unfortunately, pharmacological interventions can only partially alleviate neurological deficits [ 66 ]. our study identifies hippocampal nmda receptors linking prenatal maternal hfd exposure and offspring cognitive dysfunction, providing a basis for reducing the prevalence of prenatal maternal hfd exposure and cognitive impairment. limitation our study has some limitations. for example, returning to a regular diet during lactation and after weaning may alleviate some behavioral deficits. a study showed that dietary intervention during lactation can improve behavior and neuroinflammation in the offspring of obese mothers [ 67 ]. unlike previous research, we utilized a foster icr to raise newborns during lactation instead of altering the mother’s diet. future studies should use ultrasonic vocalizations (usv) to assess neurodevelopmental characteristics of prenatal development and understand that postnatal behavioral assessment reflects exposure to maternal hfd in utero [ 8 ]. one limitation in our design was the selective focus on hippocampal-dependent, anxiety-like, and depressive-like behaviors. attempts should be made to examine the impact of maternal hfd on offspring in different brain regions as well as regulatory pathways. data availability all data are

## Introduction
in the u.s., 26.7 and 29.5% of pregnant women are obese and overweight, respectively [ 1 ]. obesity in pregnancy increases the risk of subfertility, gestational diabetes mellitus, hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, preeclampsia, miscarriage, congenital anomalies, labor complications, and associated adverse outcomes [ 1 ]. cumulative evidence indicates that maternal obesity and even abnormal gestational weight gain are associated with increased risks of cognitive impairment, intellectual disability, autism spectrum disorder, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, anxiety and depression, epilepsy, cerebral palsy, and schizophrenia in offspring [ 2 , 3 , 4 ]. epidemiologic studies indicate that genetic factors, pregnancy conditions, postnatal influences (such as lactation or early childhood nutritional environment), and socioeconomic status are positively associated with maternal obesity as well as neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders in offspring [ 5 ]. the developmental origins of health and disease (dohad) theory by david barker explains how fetal programming affects adult health [ 6 ]. the dohad concept suggests that environmental factors, particularly maternal health, can program adult disorders during prenatal and perinatal life. increasing evidence suggests that animal models are crucial for understanding fetal programming [ 7 ]. offspring exposed to a maternal high-fat diet ( hfd) exhibited long-term effects on cognitive functions in adulthood. these effects included diminished learning and memory, reduced sociability, hyperactivity, increased anxiety-like and depressive-like behaviors, and increased reward-based eating and other addictive behaviors [ 8 ]. maternal hfd negatively affects brain development in offspring, and the impact could occur globally as well as locally in specific regions, including the hippocampus, cortex, basal forebrain, hypothalamus, amygdala, and midbrain [ 8 ]. however, these models focus on the effect of maternal hfd during pre-mating, gestation, and lactation on offspring neurodevelopment and behavioral disorders in later life [ 8 ]. most of the effects that have been observed result from a combination of prenatal and postnatal conditions. these combined effects make it challenging to disentangle the distinct contributions of prenatal and postnatal exposures. lactation is a critical postnatal factor for reprogramming neurodevelopment in offspring [ 9 , 10 , 11 ]. for instance, maternal hfd consumption during lactation reprogrammed dopaminergic circuitry in mouse offspring [ 11 ]. however, since pups begin eating solid food around two weeks after birth [ 12 ], it can be difficult to distinguish the effects of breast milk or solid hfd on their neurodevelopment. to address this limitation, the cross-fostering approach allowed us to characterize the effects of prenatal hfd and postnatal hfd. exploring the in-utero exposure to maternal hfd is essential to understanding how prenatal maternal hfd exposure programs the neurodevelopment of offspring and predisposes them to cognitive impairments in adulthood. the hippocampus employs a process known as synaptic plasticity to consolidate and maintain long-term memories [ 13 ]. nmda receptors are an integral part of the glutamatergic neurotransmission system [ 14 ]. nmda receptors modulate long-term potentiation (ltp) and long-term depression (ltd) to support synaptic plasticity, learning, and memory [ 14 ]. in addition to its role in synaptic plasticity, hippocampal neurogenesis occurs during early development, continues throughout life, and plays a significant role in learning and memory [ 15 ]. maternal hfd exposure from preconception through lactation has been linked to impaired hippocampal-dependent cognition [ 16 ], as well as disrupted neurogenesis [ 17 , 18 , 19 ] and synaptic plasticity [ 20 , 21 ]. however, the specific mechanisms through which in-utero exposure to maternal hfd impacts hippocampal neurogenesis and synaptic plasticity in offspring require further investigation. to address these gaps, neonates born from maternal hfd were transferred to icr mice (institute of cancer research mice) and reared on a control diet. this approach allowed us to isolate the in-utero effects of maternal hfd while minimizing postnatal dietary influences. we hypothesized that maternal exposure to an hfd in utero would result in spatial learning and memory deficits in offspring. these assessments may offer valuable insights into the mechanisms involved in addressing or avoiding negative cognitive consequences linked to maternal hfd. materials and methods animal c57bl/6 and icr (crl:cd-1) mice were obtained from biolasco taiwan co., ltd. (taipei, taiwan). mice were housed in groups of 2–5 in plastic cages in a temperature (23 ± 1 °c) and humidity (70%) controlled room with a 12-h light/dark cycle, lights on at 7:00 am. the mice had access to food and tap water ad libitum throughout the experiments. mice were randomly assigned to various diet groups. females were given either a control diet, which contained 13.5% kcal from fat, 28.5% kcal from protein, and 58% kcal from carbohydrate (labdiet 5010*, made by labdiet in st. louis, mo), or a high-fat diet (hfd), which contained 60.9% kcal from fat, 18.3% kcal from protein, and 20.1% kcal from carbohydrate (testdiet-58y1, made by testdiet in st. louis, mo). the subjects were given these diets for 8 weeks before mating and 3 weeks during gestation. female dams were randomly paired with control-diet male at 12 weeks. after delivery, c57bl/6 offspring (p0) were raised by icr dams on a controlled diet. to standardize competition for food and maternal attention, the litters were evenly culled to eight pups, regardless of gender. after weaning, the offspring were fed the control diet throughout the study. all behavioral tests were conducted on mice 6–8 weeks old. to investigate anxiety-like and depressive-like behaviors, open field tests and forced swimming tests were conducted on mice at 6 weeks old. y-maze and object location task were conducted on 7-week-old mice to assess working memory and spatial memory behaviors. morris water maze was conducted on 8-week-old mice to assess spatial memory behaviors. ethics approval and consent to participate the institutional animal care and use committee (ncku-iacuc-108189, ncku-iacuc-109061, and ncku-iacuc-110075) at national cheng kung university and iacuc (edah-112001, edah-112016, and edah-112018) at e-da hospital approved all animal protocols, and all animal experiments were conducted in accordance with the approved guidelines and regulations. open field test (oft) the oft is a dual assessment tool for evaluating anxiety levels and locomotor activity [ 22 ]. mice were placed within the central area of a white arena measuring 60 × 60 cm, with a height of 70 cm. the mice were tested in a random order. a video tracking system monitored the mice’s activity over 10 min. we divided the open field apparatus into nine equal squares. the squares near the walls of the open field arena were defined as outer zones, while the central square was defined as the central zone. ethovision xt tracking software (noldus information technology, the netherlands) was utilized to quantify locomotor activity. the open field arena was exposed to light at approximately 150 lux. the oft was performed from 9 a.m.–4 p.m., and all measurements of behaviors in the open field test were carried out by an observer who was blinded to the conditions. forced swimming test (fst) the fst was used to assess depressive-like behavior [ 23 ]. during this test, mice were placed individually in a clear cylinder (20 cm deep) filled with water maintained at 24 ± 1 °c. the mice were tested in a random order. mice were considered immobile when they floated upright with only slight movements to keep their heads above the water. by ‘only slight movement,’ we were referring to minimal movements of one or more limbs that are sufficient to keep the animal’s head above water. this behavior was classified as immobility, distinct from active swimming or struggling. the immobility time was measured by an observer who was unaware of the groups during the final 5 min of the 6-min testing period. we used a lighting level of 150 lux to illuminate the test room. the fst was performed from 9 a.m.–4 p.m., and all measurements of behaviors in the forced swimming test were carried out by an observer who was blinded to the conditions. the animals were recorded from a frontal perspective during the experiments, allowing us to clearly observe and analyze their swimming behaviors and immobility times. y-maze (arm alternation version) briefly, mice were placed in the maze’s center and allowed to explore the three arms for 5 min freely, and the entering sequence of the arms was recorded [ 24 ]. the mice were tested in a random order. the test was conducted under dim lighting, with an illumination level of less than 40 lux. the maze was cleaned with 70% ethanol between trials to remove olfactory cues. the y-maze test was performed from 9 a.m.–4 p.m., and all measurements of behaviors in the y-maze test were carried out by an observer who was blinded to the conditions. y-maze (arm exploration version) briefly, mice were placed in the center of the other maze and allowed to freely explore two arms (familiar arms) for 15 min. in contrast, the remaining arm was blocked (unfamiliar component). five minutes after the 15-min exploration, mice were allowed to explore the whole maze for 5 min, and each mouse’s time spent in an unfamiliar arm was recorded [ 24 ]. the mice were tested in a random order. the test was conducted under dim lighting, with an illumination level of less than 40 lux. the maze was cleaned with 70% ethanol between trials to remove olfactory cues. the y-maze test was performed from 9 a.m.–4 p.m., and all measurements of behaviors in the y-maze test were carried out by an observer who was blinded to the conditions. object location task in the 10-min sample phase, two identical objects were placed near the corners on one side of a plexiglas box that measures 46 × 26 × 21 cm. the box had black walls and a bright yellow floor and was situated in a dimly lit (&lt;40 lux) test room. the mice were tested in a random order. the mice were then placed in the arena and tasked with finding two identical objects. after that, the animals were removed from their cages and placed back into their transport cages. after a 5-min delay, the mice were placed in the chamber for a 5-min test. during the test, one of the objects was moved to a new location. the percentage of time spent exploring the new corner over exploring both objects determines recognition. the maze was cleaned with 70% ethanol between trials to remove olfactory cues. the object location task was performed from 9 a.m.–4 p.m., and all measurements of behaviors in the object location task were carried out by an observer who was blinded to the conditions. morris water maze the circular tank had a diameter of 80 cm and a height of 20 cm. it is filled with tap water, thermostatically controlled at 22 ± 1 °c, reaching a height of 10 cm. a 9 cm diameter platform was submerged 1 cm below the water surface. the test was conducted under dim lighting, with an illumination level of less than 40 lux. the platform was situated in the northwest quadrant, while mice were released randomly from the other three quadrants: southwest, southeast, and northeast. the experiment was conducted once every day for four consecutive days. the probe trial was conducted on the fifth day after the last training session. during the probe trial, the platform was removed, and the time the mice stayed in the targeted quadrant for 30 s was recorded by ethovision xt tracking software (noldus information technology, the netherlands). the duration and path of swimming were documented by ethovision xt tracking software (noldus information technology, the netherlands). the mice were tested in a random order. the morris water maze was performed from 9 a.m.–4 p.m., and all measurements of behaviors in the morris water maze were carried out by an observer who was blinded to the conditions. western blot mouse hippocampi, comprising both the dorsal and ventral regions, were dissected on ice and processed immediately as previously described [ 25 ]. briefly, tissue proteins were extracted from the whole hippocampus of control and hfd offspring at p8w. tissues were lysed in ripa buffer (20-188, millipore) with a protease inhibitor cocktail (roche, basel, switzerland). wb analyses were conducted as described previously [ 25 ]. anti-glua1(mab2263, millipore), anti-glua2 (ab1768-i, millipore), anti-mglur5 (ab76316, abcam), and anti-β actin (mab1501, millipore) antibodies were described previously [ 25 ]. anti-nmdar1 (ab109182, abcam), nmdar2 (gtx134086, genetex), psd95 (ab18258, abcam), synataxin 1a (ab41453, abcam), synaptotagmin (ab13259, abcam), and synapsin i (ab64581, abcam) were used for western blot. immunohistochemical staining to identify newly dividing cells in the hippocampal dg, we used ki67-staining methods as previously described [ 25 ]. the sections were incubated in cell conditioning 1 (cc1) for antigen retrieval and left there for 30 min. slices were incubated in mouse anti-ki67 (1/100) primary antibodies (ab15580, abcam) for 2 h. after washing with pbs, the sections were treated with the peroxidase-labeled anti-rabbit secondary antibody (histofine simple stain mouse max po, nichirei biosciences, cat no: 414341f) for 30 min and then underwent dab detection. the counterstain used was mayer’s hematoxylin. preparation and electrophysiology of hippocampal slices coronal slices of the hippocampus (300 μm) was extracted from adult male c57bl/6 mice following decapitation under isoflurane anesthesia. the dissected slices were recovered at room temperature for at least 1 h before being transferred to a submersion-type recording chamber. the chamber was consistently perfused with oxygenated (95% o 2 and 5% co 2 ) artificial cerebrospinal fluid (acsf) at a flow rate of 3–4 ml/min. the acsf composition was as follows (in mm): 117 nacl, 4.5 kcl, 2.5 cacl 2 , 1.2 mgcl 2 , 1.2 nah 2 po 4 , 25 nahco 3 , and ph = 7.4. extracellular recordings was conducted and analyzed using an axon setup (axon instruments, foster city, ca). all electrophysiological signals was sampled at 5–10 khz by pclamp software (version 11, axon instruments) through a multiclamp 700b amplifier and digidata 1550b ad converter and analyzed using clampfit software (version 11, axon instruments). evoked postsynaptic potentials was induced in ca1 stratum radiatum through electric stimulation (0.02 ms duration) of schaffer collateral/commissural afferents at 0.033 hz using a tungsten concentric bipolar microelectrode (wpi tm53ccins, sarasota, fl). field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fepsps) was recorded with a glass pipette filled with acsf (3–5 mω resistance). the strength of synaptic transmission was assessed by calculating the slope of fepsp. the high-frequency stimulation protocol inducing long-term potentiation (ltp) consists of four 0.5-s trains of 100-hz stimuli separated by 20 s. in each slice, fepsps was monitored for at least 20 min until stable fepsps are achieved. the average slope of fepsps recorded for 10 min served as the baseline of fepsp slope before ltp stimulation. the magnitude of ltp was determined by the average slope of 30 fepsps recorded 50–60 min after high-frequency stimulation (hfs) and expressed as a percentage of the baseline fepsp slope. stereotaxic injections mice were anesthetized and then placed in a stereotaxic frame. the area around the incision was trimmed, and the meninges were treated with 3% hydrogen peroxide. the bregma was identified as the origin, and solutions were injected bilaterally into the dg of the dorsal hippocampus using the following coordinates: (from bregma) anterior = −1.7 mm, lateral = ± 1.6 mm, (from skull surface) height = −0.16 mm. a concentrated solution of 2.0 μl was injected stereotaxically over 10 min using a 5-ml 33 s-gauge hamilton syringe. the needle was kept in place for 10 min and then slowly removed. the skin was closed using a silk suture. the mice were monitored during their recovery period. after a seven-day recovery period following cannulation, mice received microinjections of drugs prior to behavioral assessments. saline, mk-801 (0.5 mg/kg, once/day), dl-apv (0.5μg/kg, once/day), or nmda (1 μm, once/day), was microinjected into the dg of the dorsal hippocampus once daily for 12 days. in this experimental setting, we employed daily acute administration of the drugs to investigate their long-lasting effects on behavioral responses. behavioral tests were performed one week after the injection. mk-801(cat no:10009019,) and nmda (cat no:14581) were purchased from cayman. dl-apv (cat no: hb0252) was purchased from hello bio. statistics data were expressed as means ± sem. the analysis was performed using graphpad prism 6 (graphpad, la jolla, ca, usa), jasp (version 0.19.3.0; jasp team) and r software version 4.4.2. data were initially tested for normal distribution using the shapiro-wilk test and for homogeneity of variance using levene’s test (supplementary table 1 ). for data sets that met the criteria for parametric statistics, appropriate tests included student’s t-test (two-tailed), one-way anova with tukey’s post hoc test, or two-way anova with sidak’s post hoc test. for non-parametric data sets, we used the mann-whitney u test (two-tailed) for 2-group comparison, kruskal-wallis test with dunn’s post hoc tests, or the scheirer–ray–hare test followed by wilcoxon rank-sum tests with bonferroni correction for pairwise comparisons. the rout method with a q-coefficient of 1% was applied to identify potential outliers. results a mouse model investigating the effects of maternal hfd on the cognitive behaviors of offspring to investigate the impact of intrauterine exposure to maternal hfd, which conveys risks for cognitive behaviors in offspring, the experimental flowchart was shown in fig. 1a . female dams were fed the control or high-fat diet (hfd) for eight weeks. after eight weeks of dietary intervention, the dams fed an hfd had a significantly increased body weight compared to those fed the control diet (fig. 1b ). to assess the impact of maternal diet, female dams were paired with control-diet male dams at 12 weeks, and pregnant dams were maintained on control-diet or hfd throughout gestation. to prevent the effect of maternal hfd exposure during lactation, newborns were reared by foster icr mothers under control-diet conditions for the lactation period. after weaning, the mice were fed a control diet. mouse behavioral changes were tested, as shown in fig. 1a . fig. 1: maternal hfd exposure resulted in impaired spatial learning and memory in offspring. a

post hoc test: ctrl vs. mk801, n.s.; ctrl vs. dl-apv, n.s.; mk801 vs. dl-apv, n.s.] and crossing numbers [kruskal-wallis test, p = 0.7334; post hoc test: ctrl vs. mk801, n.s.; ctrl vs. dl-apv, n.s.; mk801 vs. dl-apv, n.s.] were observed in either mk-801 or f dl-apv groups (fig. 5d, e ). representative heat maps are shown in fig. 5f . long-term potentiation (ltp) is a form of synaptic plasticity that occurs at most synapses in the nervous system due to activity-dependent changes in synaptic transmission [ 35 ]. to assess the effects of mk801 and dl-apv on synaptic plasticity, we tested whether mk801 or dl-apv could successfully block the induction of timing-dependent ltp (t-ltp) in hippocampal slices. the slices were obtained from mice that received drug administration. the magnitude of hippocampal ca1 ltp in slices from mice receiving intrahippocampal microinjection of mk-801 or dl-apv showed a significantly reduced magnitude of ltp compared with the control group [one-way anova, f (2, 17) = 8.436, p = 0.0029; post hoc test: ctrl vs. mk801, p &lt; 0.05; ctrl vs. dl-apv, p &lt; 0.01; mk801 vs. dl-apv, n.s.] (fig. 5g ). to our knowledge, this is the first report of the impact of intradorsal hippocampal (ca1) injection of mk-801 and dl-apv effectively reducing hippocampal ltp, resulting in deficits in spatial learning and memory. these findings prove that nmda receptors in the hippocampus play a role in spatial learning and memory. although this approach offered insights into hippocampal nmda receptor signaling and neurocognitive deficits, it failed to address potential mechanisms acting during critical windows of neurodevelopment. fig. 5: effects of nmda receptor antagonists on the hippocampal ca1 ltp and spatial memory. a timeline of the experiment. the model was created using biorender. b the y-maze task with a blocked arm test examined the effects of mk-801 or dl-apv on spatial memory in mice. the data displays the time spent in the unfamiliar arm as the mean ± sem with individual value plots.

environment plays a crucial role in fetal programming per the dohad hypothesis [ 6 ]. in fig. s1 , we provided our model for maternal hfd exposure in utero impaired behavior in offspring. we provide evidence that feeding female mice an hfd during pre-mating and gestation is sufficient to impair spatial working memory and spatial memory, to cause depression-like behavior in offspring. our findings indicated the long-term effects of maternal hfd on neurocognitive functions, indicating that prenatal maternal hfd exposure can make individuals more susceptible to cognitive impairments later in life. changes in hippocampal synaptic plasticity were identified through electrophysiological studies. further, activation of nmda signaling rescues spatial learning and memory deficits in offspring of maternal hfd. animal behavioral testing results depend on the sex, age, and timeline of maternal hfd model implementation. previous studies failed to distinguish between the prenatal and postnatal effects of maternal hfd on offspring. in our animal model, newborns were reared by foster icr mothers with excellent maternal characteristics (e.g. nest building, pup retrieval behavior, nursing and grooming of the pups) [ 37 ] on a control diet during the lactation period, offering new insights into several aspects. pre-conception and pregnancy are critical periods for appropriately programming epigenetic mechanisms [ 38 ]. our experimental design using icr foster mothers during lactation provides a clearer understanding of the bona-fide in utero effects. notably, hfd negatively affects maternal behavior, such as nest building and pup retrieval [ 39 ]. in c57bl/6 mice, maternal hfd negatively affects mammopoiesis, milk production, and pup retrieval [ 40 ]. in our model, litters at gestation day (gd) 18.5 were significantly smaller in hfd mice than in control mice (fig. s2a ), indicating that the fecundity of hfd-fed mothers was compromised. consistent with previous studies [ 40 , 41 , 42 ], our maternal hfd model timeline was associated with poor pup survival in c57bl/6 mice (fig. s2b ). fostering hfd pups with icr mothers significantly improved their survival rates, but the number of live pups remained lower than that of the control group (fig. s2b ). therefore, foster icr mothers could protect newborns from inadequate maternal care in our maternal hfd model during lactation. we showed that in-utero exposure to maternal hfd resulted in persistent behavioral deficits even after returning to a normal diet during lactation and after weaning. nmda receptors comprise two nmdar1 subunits and two nmdar2 or nmdar3 subunits [ 43 ]. the role of nmda receptors in plasticity mechanisms related to recognition memory processes in the perirhinal cortex, hippocampus, temporal association cortex, and mpfc has been well-established [ 44 ]. our findings indicate maternal exposure to hfd in utero diminishes hippocampal nmda receptor and psd95 protein expression in the offspring, which displays deficits in hippocampal ltp. previous studies indicated that offspring of maternal hfd during pregnancy and lactation displayed impaired nmdar2a/ nmdar2b ratio in the hippocampus [ 45 , 46 ], and impaired ltp at ca3-ca1 synapses in offspring [ 20 , 21 ]. the precise mechanism by which prenatal exposure to hfd reduces hippocampal nmda receptor expression remains to be explored. in one study, maternal hfd alters fetal brain microrna expression which is associated with decreased nmdar expression [ 45 ]. in another study, maternal hfd negatively affects the synaptic plasticity of their offspring by epigenetically suppressing the expression of bdnf in the hippocampus [ 21 ]. more studies are required to decipher the mechanism by which maternal obesity affects nmda receptor expression in male offspring. for the first time, we provide evidence that daily acute administration of nmda into the hippocampal dg of hfd offspring activates nmda receptor signaling, producing a long-lasting effect that counteracts reduced ltp and improves cognitive function and memory impairments. in line with prior studies, our study provides clear evidence that prenatal maternal hfd exposure impacts the synaptic plasticity and cognitive behavior of offspring through the hippocampal nmda receptor pathways. our findings indicate that nmda receptors are necessary for the effects of maternal hfd on offspring learning and memory. antagonist experiments demonstrate that blocking nmda receptor signaling mitigates hippocampus-dependent tasks, underscoring their necessity in neurocognitive alterations observed in offspring exposed to maternal hfd. conversely, nmda receptor activation through nmda injections was sufficient to rescue hippocampus-dependent tasks in maternal hfd offspring, further supporting the involvement of nmda receptor activity in this process. these results suggest that nmda receptor dysregulation may underlie the learning and memory impairments associated with maternal hfd. collectively, our findings underscore the pivotal role of nmda receptors in the interplay between maternal diet and offspring cognitive function. the concentrations of nmda receptor antagonists and agonists were chosen based on prior research showing their effectiveness in modulating nmda receptor activity in vivo. these concentrations, while not physiological, are widely utilized as pharmacological tools to evaluate the role of nmda receptors in memory and synaptic plasticity. regarding the nmda concentration used for activation, the dose was chosen based on prior studies showing that this concentration effectively activates nmda receptors in vivo [ 36 ]. the potential mechanism underlying the long-term effects of acute nmda receptor activation involves synaptic plasticity, including ltp, which is critical for sustained changes in neuronal function and behavior. nmda receptor activation is well-known to facilitate calcium influx, triggering intracellular signaling cascades and gene transcription necessary for enduring synaptic modifications [ 47 ]. impaired neurogenesis in the adult hippocampus has been linked to learning and memory [ 48 ]. research has shown that maternal hfd consumed from preconception through lactation significantly impaired hippocampal neurogenesis in offspring [ 17 , 18 , 19 ]. in this study, we also found that in utero exposure to hfd leads to impaired hippocampal neurogenesis in offspring. although synaptic dysfunction and impaired neurogenesis may jointly contribute to neurobehavioral deficits in the offspring [ 49 , 50 ], our results indicate that daily acute administration of nmda into the hippocampal dg is sufficient to produce a long-lasting effect in rescuing cognitive function. these data suggested a potential mechanism through which nmda enhances synaptic plasticity or compensates for deficits in neurogenesis. furthermore, exploring the connection between synaptic plasticity and neurogenesis will provide a clearer understanding of the mechanisms behind the observed outcomes. epidemiological studies have revealed an association between maternal obesity and depression in their children [ 51 ]. previous research, including our own, has shown that maternal hfd can influence the offspring’s susceptibility to depression-like behavior [ 52 , 53 ]. a possible mechanism for this association is that maternal hfd impairs the development of the serotonergic and dopaminergic systems in offspring, which are crucial for regulating emotional behavior [ 51 , 54 , 55 ]. notably, these neurotransmitter systems also play a role in learning and memory [ 56 , 57 ]. serotonin enhances the activation of nmda receptors and facilitates the expression of ltp in the ca1 region [ 58 ]. dopamine modulates synaptic strength in neuronal circuits by influencing neuronal populations that drive ltp and ltd [ 59 ]. together, these results showed that maternal obesity has multiple effects on offspring’s neurodevelopment and leads to cognitive defects. in humans, sexual dimorphism exists, with male predominance in cases of adhd and female predominance in cases of overweight and obesity [ 11 , 60 , 61 ]. previous work already showed the sexually dimorphic effect of maternal obesity on neurodevelopment. neuroinflammatory responses, epigenetic regulation, gene expression patterns, and microglia and astrocyte cell function may jointly contribute to sexual dimorphism in neurodevelopmental disorders [ 8 , 62 , 63 , 64 ]. to examine the sexual differences in our model, we conducted a two-way anova with maternal diet and sex as factors to evaluate potential interactions. the analysis revealed no significant interaction, indicating that maternal diet effects were not strictly sex-dependent. however, male offspring exposed to maternal hfd showed substantial reductions in hippocampal psd95, nmdar1, and nmdar2 expression, along with decreased neurogenesis and impaired water maze performance (supplementary table 2 ). the mean differences in these measures were larger in males than in females, suggesting greater susceptibility of male offspring to maternal hfd-induced cognitive dysfunction (supplementary table 2 ). these findings highlight potential biological differences between sexes, warranting further research to elucidate the underlying mechanisms. in conclusion, our model enabled us to rigorously investigate the mechanisms underlying cognitive dysfunction in response to maternal hfd in utero. this is concerning because there is evidence of an increase in obesity among pregnant women and in the prevalence of childhood cognitive impairment [ 65 ]. unfortunately, pharmacological interventions can only partially alleviate neurological deficits [ 66 ]. our study identifies hippocampal nmda receptors linking prenatal maternal hfd exposure and offspring cognitive dysfunction, providing a basis for reducing the prevalence of prenatal maternal hfd exposure and cognitive impairment. limitation our study has some limitations. for example, returning to a regular diet during lactation and after weaning may alleviate some behavioral deficits. a study showed that dietary intervention during lactation can improve behavior and neuroinflammation in the offspring of obese mothers [ 67 ]. unlike previous research, we utilized a foster icr to raise newborns during lactation instead of altering the mother’s diet. future studies should use ultrasonic vocalizations (usv) to assess neurodevelopmental characteristics of prenatal development and understand that postnatal behavioral assessment reflects exposure to maternal hfd in utero [ 8 ]. one limitation in our design was the selective focus on hippocampal-dependent, anxiety-like, and depressive-like behaviors. attempts should be made to examine the impact of maternal hfd on offspring in different brain regions as well as regulatory pathways. data availability all data are

## Methods
animal c57bl/6 and icr (crl:cd-1) mice were obtained from biolasco taiwan co., ltd. (taipei, taiwan). mice were housed in groups of 2–5 in plastic cages in a temperature (23 ± 1 °c) and humidity (70%) controlled room with a 12-h light/dark cycle, lights on at 7:00 am. the mice had access to food and tap water ad libitum throughout the experiments. mice were randomly assigned to various diet groups. females were given either a control diet, which contained 13.5% kcal from fat, 28.5% kcal from protein, and 58% kcal from carbohydrate (labdiet 5010*, made by labdiet in st. louis, mo), or a high-fat diet (hfd), which contained 60.9% kcal from fat, 18.3% kcal from protein, and 20.1% kcal from carbohydrate (testdiet-58y1, made by testdiet in st. louis, mo). the subjects were given these diets for 8 weeks before mating and 3 weeks during gestation. female dams were randomly paired with control-diet male at 12 weeks. after delivery, c57bl/6 offspring (p0) were raised by icr dams on a controlled diet. to standardize competition for food and maternal attention, the litters were evenly culled to eight pups, regardless of gender. after weaning, the offspring were fed the control diet throughout the study. all behavioral tests were conducted on mice 6–8 weeks old. to investigate anxiety-like and depressive-like behaviors, open field tests and forced swimming tests were conducted on mice at 6 weeks old. y-maze and object location task were conducted on 7-week-old mice to assess working memory and spatial memory behaviors. morris water maze was conducted on 8-week-old mice to assess spatial memory behaviors. ethics approval and consent to participate the institutional animal care and use committee (ncku-iacuc-108189, ncku-iacuc-109061, and ncku-iacuc-110075) at national cheng kung university and iacuc (edah-112001, edah-112016, and edah-112018) at e-da hospital approved all animal protocols, and all animal experiments were conducted in accordance with the approved guidelines and regulations. open field test (oft) the oft is a dual assessment tool for evaluating anxiety levels and locomotor activity [ 22 ]. mice were placed within the central area of a white arena measuring 60 × 60 cm, with a height of 70 cm. the mice were tested in a random order. a video tracking system monitored the mice’s activity over 10 min. we divided the open field apparatus into nine equal squares. the squares near the walls of the open field arena were defined as outer zones, while the central square was defined as the central zone. ethovision xt tracking software (noldus information technology, the netherlands) was utilized to quantify locomotor activity. the open field arena was exposed to light at approximately 150 lux. the oft was performed from 9 a.m.–4 p.m., and all measurements of behaviors in the open field test were carried out by an observer who was blinded to the conditions. forced swimming test (fst) the fst was used to assess depressive-like behavior [ 23 ]. during this test, mice were placed individually in a clear cylinder (20 cm deep) filled with water maintained at 24 ± 1 °c. the mice were tested in a random order. mice were considered immobile when they floated upright with only slight movements to keep their heads above the water. by ‘only slight movement,’ we were referring to minimal movements of one or more limbs that are sufficient to keep the animal’s head above water. this behavior was classified as immobility, distinct from active swimming or struggling. the immobility time was measured by an observer who was unaware of the groups during the final 5 min of the 6-min testing period. we used a lighting level of 150 lux to illuminate the test room. the fst was performed from 9 a.m.–4 p.m., and all measurements of behaviors in the forced swimming test were carried out by an observer who was blinded to the conditions. the animals were recorded from a frontal perspective during the experiments, allowing us to clearly observe and analyze their swimming behaviors and immobility times. y-maze (arm alternation version) briefly, mice were placed in the maze’s center and allowed to explore the three arms for 5 min freely, and the entering sequence of the arms was recorded [ 24 ]. the mice were tested in a random order. the test was conducted under dim lighting, with an illumination level of less than 40 lux. the maze was cleaned with 70% ethanol between trials to remove olfactory cues. the y-maze test was performed from 9 a.m.–4 p.m., and all measurements of behaviors in the y-maze test were carried out by an observer who was blinded to the conditions. y-maze (arm exploration version) briefly, mice were placed in the center of the other maze and allowed to freely explore two arms (familiar arms) for 15 min. in contrast, the remaining arm was blocked (unfamiliar component). five minutes after the 15-min exploration, mice were allowed to explore the whole maze for 5 min, and each mouse’s time spent in an unfamiliar arm was recorded [ 24 ]. the mice were tested in a random order. the test was conducted under dim lighting, with an illumination level of less than 40 lux. the maze was cleaned with 70% ethanol between trials to remove olfactory cues. the y-maze test was performed from 9 a.m.–4 p.m., and all measurements of behaviors in the y-maze test were carried out by an observer who was blinded to the conditions. object location task in the 10-min sample phase, two identical objects were placed near the corners on one side of a plexiglas box that measures 46 × 26 × 21 cm. the box had black walls and a bright yellow floor and was situated in a dimly lit (&lt;40 lux) test room. the mice were tested in a random order. the mice were then placed in the arena and tasked with finding two identical objects. after that, the animals were removed from their cages and placed back into their transport cages. after a 5-min delay, the mice were placed in the chamber for a 5-min test. during the test, one of the objects was moved to a new location. the percentage of time spent exploring the new corner over exploring both objects determines recognition. the maze was cleaned with 70% ethanol between trials to remove olfactory cues. the object location task was performed from 9 a.m.–4 p.m., and all measurements of behaviors in the object location task were carried out by an observer who was blinded to the conditions. morris water maze the circular tank had a diameter of 80 cm and a height of 20 cm. it is filled with tap water, thermostatically controlled at 22 ± 1 °c, reaching a height of 10 cm. a 9 cm diameter platform was submerged 1 cm below the water surface. the test was conducted under dim lighting, with an illumination level of less than 40 lux. the platform was situated in the northwest quadrant, while mice were released randomly from the other three quadrants: southwest, southeast, and northeast. the experiment was conducted once every day for four consecutive days. the probe trial was conducted on the fifth day after the last training session. during the probe trial, the platform was removed, and the time the mice stayed in the targeted quadrant for 30 s was recorded by ethovision xt tracking software (noldus information technology, the netherlands). the duration and path of swimming were documented by ethovision xt tracking software (noldus information technology, the netherlands). the mice were tested in a random order. the morris water maze was performed from 9 a.m.–4 p.m., and all measurements of behaviors in the morris water maze were carried out by an observer who was blinded to the conditions. western blot mouse hippocampi, comprising both the dorsal and ventral regions, were dissected on ice and processed immediately as previously described [ 25 ]. briefly, tissue proteins were extracted from the whole hippocampus of control and hfd offspring at p8w. tissues were lysed in ripa buffer (20-188, millipore) with a protease inhibitor cocktail (roche, basel, switzerland). wb analyses were conducted as described previously [ 25 ]. anti-glua1(mab2263, millipore), anti-glua2 (ab1768-i, millipore), anti-mglur5 (ab76316, abcam), and anti-β actin (mab1501, millipore) antibodies were described previously [ 25 ]. anti-nmdar1 (ab109182, abcam), nmdar2 (gtx134086, genetex), psd95 (ab18258, abcam), synataxin 1a (ab41453, abcam), synaptotagmin (ab13259, abcam), and synapsin i (ab64581, abcam) were used for western blot. immunohistochemical staining to identify newly dividing cells in the hippocampal dg, we used ki67-staining methods as previously described [ 25 ]. the sections were incubated in cell conditioning 1 (cc1) for antigen retrieval and left there for 30 min. slices were incubated in mouse anti-ki67 (1/100) primary antibodies (ab15580, abcam) for 2 h. after washing with pbs, the sections were treated with the peroxidase-labeled anti-rabbit secondary antibody (histofine simple stain mouse max po, nichirei biosciences, cat no: 414341f) for 30 min and then underwent dab detection. the counterstain used was mayer’s hematoxylin. preparation and electrophysiology of hippocampal slices coronal slices of the hippocampus (300 μm) was extracted from adult male c57bl/6 mice following decapitation under isoflurane anesthesia. the dissected slices were recovered at room temperature for at least 1 h before being transferred to a submersion-type recording chamber. the chamber was consistently perfused with oxygenated (95% o 2 and 5% co 2 ) artificial cerebrospinal fluid (acsf) at a flow rate of 3–4 ml/min. the acsf composition was as follows (in mm): 117 nacl, 4.5 kcl, 2.5 cacl 2 , 1.2 mgcl 2 , 1.2 nah 2 po 4 , 25 nahco 3 , and ph = 7.4. extracellular recordings was conducted and analyzed using an axon setup (axon instruments, foster city, ca). all electrophysiological signals was sampled at 5–10 khz by pclamp software (version 11, axon instruments) through a multiclamp 700b amplifier and digidata 1550b ad converter and analyzed using clampfit software (version 11, axon instruments). evoked postsynaptic potentials was induced in ca1 stratum radiatum through electric stimulation (0.02 ms duration) of schaffer collateral/commissural afferents at 0.033 hz using a tungsten concentric bipolar microelectrode (wpi tm53ccins, sarasota, fl). field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fepsps) was recorded with a glass pipette filled with acsf (3–5 mω resistance). the strength of synaptic transmission was assessed by calculating the slope of fepsp. the high-frequency stimulation protocol inducing long-term potentiation (ltp) consists of four 0.5-s trains of 100-hz stimuli separated by 20 s. in each slice, fepsps was monitored for at least 20 min until stable fepsps are achieved. the average slope of fepsps recorded for 10 min served as the baseline of fepsp slope before ltp stimulation. the magnitude of ltp was determined by the average slope of 30 fepsps recorded 50–60 min after high-frequency stimulation (hfs) and expressed as a percentage of the baseline fepsp slope. stereotaxic injections mice were anesthetized and then placed in a stereotaxic frame. the area around the incision was trimmed, and the meninges were treated with 3% hydrogen peroxide. the bregma was identified as the origin, and solutions were injected bilaterally into the dg of the dorsal hippocampus using the following coordinates: (from bregma) anterior = −1.7 mm, lateral = ± 1.6 mm, (from skull surface) height = −0.16 mm. a concentrated solution of 2.0 μl was injected stereotaxically over 10 min using a 5-ml 33 s-gauge hamilton syringe. the needle was kept in place for 10 min and then slowly removed. the skin was closed using a silk suture. the mice were monitored during their recovery period. after a seven-day recovery period following cannulation, mice received microinjections of drugs prior to behavioral assessments. saline, mk-801 (0.5 mg/kg, once/day), dl-apv (0.5μg/kg, once/day), or nmda (1 μm, once/day), was microinjected into the dg of the dorsal hippocampus once daily for 12 days. in this experimental setting, we employed daily acute administration of the drugs to investigate their long-lasting effects on behavioral responses. behavioral tests were performed one week after the injection. mk-801(cat no:10009019,) and nmda (cat no:14581) were purchased from cayman. dl-apv (cat no: hb0252) was purchased from hello bio. statistics data were expressed as means ± sem. the analysis was performed using graphpad prism 6 (graphpad, la jolla, ca, usa), jasp (version 0.19.3.0; jasp team) and r software version 4.4.2. data were initially tested for normal distribution using the shapiro-wilk test and for homogeneity of variance using levene’s test (supplementary table 1 ). for data sets that met the criteria for parametric statistics, appropriate tests included student’s t-test (two-tailed), one-way anova with tukey’s post hoc test, or two-way anova with sidak’s post hoc test. for non-parametric data sets, we used the mann-whitney u test (two-tailed) for 2-group comparison, kruskal-wallis test with dunn’s post hoc tests, or the scheirer–ray–hare test followed by wilcoxon rank-sum tests with bonferroni correction for pairwise comparisons. the rout method with a q-coefficient of 1% was applied to identify potential outliers. results a mouse model investigating the effects of maternal hfd on the cognitive behaviors of offspring to investigate the impact of intrauterine exposure to maternal hfd, which conveys risks for cognitive behaviors in offspring, the experimental flowchart was shown in fig. 1a . female dams were fed the control or high-fat diet (hfd) for eight weeks. after eight weeks of dietary intervention, the dams fed an hfd had a significantly increased body weight compared to those fed the control diet (fig. 1b ). to assess the impact of maternal diet, female dams were paired with control-diet male dams at 12 weeks, and pregnant dams were maintained on control-diet or hfd throughout gestation. to prevent the effect of maternal hfd exposure during lactation, newborns were reared by foster icr mothers under control-diet conditions for the lactation period. after weaning, the mice were fed a control diet. mouse behavioral changes were tested, as shown in fig. 1a . fig. 1: maternal hfd exposure resulted in impaired spatial learning and memory in offspring. a

(ctrl male offspring, n = 10; ctrl female, n = 8; hfd male offspring, n = 13; hfd female offspring, n = 7). a, c , d , e , and i , the models were created using biorender. full size image maternal hfd exposure showed impairments in spatial learning and memory in offspring y-maze, morris water maze, and object location tasks were assessed to evaluate the spatial learning and memory of offspring. the y-maze spontaneous alternation test was used to assess spatial working memory. the offspring born to hfd-fed mothers did not show a defect in the y-maze spontaneous alternation test [two-way anova, interaction f (1,53) = 0.9659, p = 0.330; sex f (1, 53) = 0.5392, p = 0.466; diet f (1, 53) = 0.8275, p = 0.3671] (fig. 1c ). in the y-maze task with a blocked arm, maternal hfd impaired spatial working memory in offspring [scheirer–ray–hare test, interaction h = 0.664, p = 0.415; sex h = 1.399, p = 0.237; diet h = 5.515, p = 0.019] (fig. 1d ). in the morris water maze, in the probe tests, maternal hfd impaired spatial learning and memory in offspring [two-way anova, interaction f (1,56) = 0.9601, p = 0.3314; sex f (1, 56) = 0.0513, p = 0.8217; diet f (1, 56) = 23.31, p &lt; 0.0001] (fig. 1e, f ). compared with the control mice, no differences in the distance [scheirer–ray–hare test, interaction h = 0.681, p = 0.409; sex h = 0.078, p = 0.780; diet h = 1.351, p = 0.245] and crossing numbers [scheirer–ray–hare test, interaction h = 0.953, p = 0.329; sex h = 0.061, p = 0.806; diet h = 2.524, p = 0.112] were observed in hfd offspring (fig. 1g and h ). the offspring born to hfd-fed mothers did not show a defect in the object location task [two-way anova, interaction f (1,34) = 0.1264, p = 0.724; sex f (1, 34) = 0.04585, p = 0.832; diet f (1, 34) = 0.2999, p = 0.588] (fig. 1i ). this finding suggests that the offspring of the hfd moms had impaired spatial memory and working memory function. these behavioral data provided evidence that maternal hfd offspring exhibit hippocampal-dependent spatial learning and memory deficits. these findings also indicated that early environmental challenges, such as maternal hfd, could program long-lasting changes in hippocampal function, leading to cognitive impairments observable in adulthood. effects of maternal hfd on anxiety-like and depression-like behaviors of offspring previous studies have shown that anxiety can influence spatial learning [ 26 ]. the offspring’s anxiety-like behavior was assessed through an open field test (oft). our data found that offspring born to hfd-fed mothers showed no difference in the time spent exploring the center of the oft [scheirer–ray–hare test, interaction h = 0.036, p = 0.849; sex h = 1.958, p = 0.161; diet h = 1.970, p = 0.160] (fig. 2a ). this finding suggests that hfd offspring showed no significant differences in anxiety-like behavior. thus, our data indicated that the learning and memory deficits in offspring of hfd were independent of anxiety. compared with the control mice, the offspring born to hfd-fed mothers showed comparable in the distance traveled in an open-field test [two-way anova, interaction f (1,53) = 3.811, p = 0.0562; sex f (1, 53) = 11.09, p = 0.0016; diet f (1, 53) = 0.1062, p = 0.7458] (fig. 2b ). we also tested the effects of maternal hfd on depression-like behavior in the offspring, which were evaluated in the forced swimming test (fst). the results that there was an interaction effect of sex and diet on the time of immobility [two-way anova, interaction f (1,55) = 4.903, p = 0.0310; sex f (1, 55) = 5.068, p = 0.0284; diet f (1, 55) = 103.5, p &lt; 0.0001] (fig. 2c ). post hoc analysis revealed that male ( p &lt; 0.0001) and female ( p &lt; 0.0001) offspring from maternal hfd exhibited a significantly increased duration of immobility (fig. 2c ). the findings indicated that the hfd offspring’s immobility time was greater than that of the control group, suggesting that maternal hfd leads to depression-like behavior in the offspring (fig. 2c ). fig. 2: effects of maternal hfd on the anxiety-like and depressive-like behaviors of offspring. a the open field test examined the effects of prenatal maternal hfd exposure on anxiety-like behavior in male and female offspring. the data presents the percentage of time spent in the center in the open field test as the mean ± sem, accompanied by individual value plots. (ctrl male offspring, n = 15; ctrl female, n = 10; hfd male offspring, n = 16; hfd female offspring, n = 16). b the open field test examined the effects of prenatal maternal hfd exposure on hyperactivity behavior in male and female offspring. the data presents the total distance traveled in the open field test as the mea n ± sem, accompanied by individual value plots. (ctrl male offspring, n = 15; ctrl female offspring, n = 10; hfd male offspring, n = 16; hfd female offspring, n = 16). c the forced swimming test examined the effects of prenatal maternal hfd exposure on depressive-like behavior in male and female offspring. the data on immobility in the forced swimming test are presented as the mean ± sem with individual value plots. (ctrl male offspring, n = 15; ctrl female, n = 10; hfd male offspring, n = 18; hfd female offspring, n = 16). post hoc significance: **** p &lt; 0.0001. full size image altered nmda receptors in the hfd offspring an underlying mechanism of learning and memory processes is hippocampal synaptic plasticity [ 27 ]. to understand the functional characteristics of hippocampal synaptic plasticity, we evaluated the expressions of key genes and proteins in the hippocampus. the expression levels of presynaptic protein markers including syntaxin 1a [scheirer–ray–hare test, interaction h = 0.8533, p = 0.3569; sex h = 4.563, p = 0.033; diet h = 1.470, p = 0.225], snap25 [interaction f (1,20) = 1.820, p = 0.1924; sex f (1,20) = 8.103, p = 0.0100; diet f (1,20) = 0.01073, p = 0.9185], synaptotagmin [scheirer–ray–hare test, interaction h = 0.213, p = 0.644; sex h = 0.480, p = 0.488; diet h = 0.013, p = 0.908], synapsin i [scheirer–ray–hare test, interaction h = 0.963, p = 0.326; sex h = 7.363, p = 0.007; diet h = 0.013, p = 0.908] were comparable in the hippocampus of the hfd offspring compared to the control group (fig. 3a, b ), whereas the expression level of postsynaptic marker postsynaptic density 95 (psd95) was decreased in the hippocampus in hfd offspring compared to controls [two-way anova, interaction f (1,20) = 0.7524, p = 0.3960; sex f (1,20) = 0.3724, p = 0.5486; diet f (1,20) = 9.071, p = 0.0069] (fig. 3a, b ). the offspring born to mothers fed a hfd showed a statistically significant decrease in hippocampal psd95 compared to the control group (fig. 3b ). psd95 regulates synaptic maturation by interacting, stabilizing, and trafficking amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid receptor (ampar) n-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (nmdar) to the postsynaptic membrane [ 28 ]. ampa and nmda receptors play crucial roles in synaptic function and memory formation [ 28 ]. the expression levels of nmdar1 [two-way anova, interaction f (1,16) = 3.783, p = 0.0696; sex f (1,16) = 2.097, p = 0.1699; diet f (1,16) = 4.745, p = 0.0477] and nmdar2 [two-way anova, interaction f (1,16) = 1.091, p = 0.3117; sex f (1,16) = 3.356, p = 0.0856; diet f (1,16) = 5.450, p = 0.0329] were decreased in the hippocampus of the hfd offspring compared to the control group, whereas the expression levels of glur1 [two-way anova, interaction f (1,16) = 0.04938, p = 0.8270; sex f (1,16) = 0.6834, p = 0.4206; diet f (1,16) = 0.1026, p = 0.3262], glur2 [scheirer–ray–hare test, interaction h = 0.002, p = 0.963; sex h = 1.006, p = 0.316; diet h = 0.051, p = 0.821], and mglur5 [two-way anova, interaction f (1,16) = 1.547, p = 0.2315; sex f (1,16) = 0.001236, p = 0.9724; diet f (1,16) = 1.179, p = 0.2936] were comparable in the hippocampus of the hfd offspring compared to the control group (fig. 3c, d ). the offspring born to mothers fed an hfd showed a statistically significant decrease in hippocampal nmdar1 and nmdar2 compared to the control group (fig. 3d ). magnusson et al. demonstrated a significant correlation between nmdar2b protein levels and spatial learning using the morris water maze, suggesting that spatial learning correlates with hippocampal expression of nr2b [ 29 ]. this supports the role of nmdar dysregulation as a mechanism underlying cognitive deficits. together, offspring exposed to a maternal hfd have significantly reduced expression of nmda receptors and postsynaptic proteins in the hippocampus, impairing spatial learning and memory. fig. 3: the expression levels of ampar, nmdar, postsynaptic, and presynaptic protein markers in the hippocampus of the offspring. a , b the protein levels of psd95, syntaxin 1a, snap25, synaptotagmin, synapsin i, and actin in the hippocampus of male and female offspring from maternal control and hfd ( a ). protein quantification data normalized to β-actin ( b ). data were expressed as mean ± sd ( n = 6 mice in each group). c and d the protein levels of nmdar1, nmdar2, glua1, glua2, and mglur5 in the hippocampus. c protein quantification data normalized to β-actin ( d ). data were expressed as mean ± sem ( n = 4–6 mice in each group). full size image impaired hippocampal neurogenesis in hfd offspring numerous studies support the notion of a strong interconnection among learning and memory processes, synaptic plasticity, and neurogenesis [ 30 ]. a previous study indicated that nmda receptors in granule cells contribute to adult neurogenesis and normal dentate gyrus development [ 31 ]. to investigate the effect of maternal hfd on neurogenesis in the hippocampus of offspring, we compared the number of newborn hippocampal neurons between the hfd and control groups using ki67 staining. staining was quantified in the dorsal hippocampal dg at the bregma coordinates of −1.06 to −2.06 mm. maternal hfd reduces hippocampal neurogenesis in offspring [two-way anova, interaction f (1,20) = 1.097, p = 0.3075; sex f (1, 20) = 1.138, p = 0.2988; diet f (1, 20) = 9.161, p = 0.0067] (fig. 4a and b ). our data also indicated that in-utero exposure to maternal hfd reduces hippocampal neurogenesis in the offspring (fig. 4a, b ). together, these results suggest that in-utero exposure to maternal hfd reduced neurogenesis in the hippocampus of offspring, leading to impaired spatial learning and memory. fig. 4: hippocampal cell proliferation in control and hfd offspring. a representative pictures of the immunohistochemistry stain for ki67 in hippocampus tissue in the two groups. scale bar, 100 μm. b quantitative analysis of hippocampal ki67 cells between the two groups (ctrl male offspring, n = 6; ctrl female offspring, n = 6; hfd male offspring, n = 5; hfd female offspring, n = 7). data are presented as the mean ± sem. full size image disruption of hippocampal nmda receptor signaling is sufficient to induce deficits in spatial learning and memory does blockade of hippocampal nmda receptor signaling in the hippocampus contribute to the behavioral effects we observe in hfd offspring? to address this issue, we targeted nmda receptor signaling in the hippocampus by intrahippocampal microinjecting nmda receptor antagonists into the dorsal hippocampus (ca1) of control adult mice (fig. 5a ). the experiment did not focus on developmental periods, as the aim was to understand signaling pathways and neurocognitive deficits instead of developmental impacts. we used two nmda receptor antagonists, mk-801 (0.5 mg/kg) and dl-apv (0.5 μg/mouse), to test whether reducing nmda receptor signaling during this period leads to spatial learning and memory deficits. a previous study found that microinjection of mk801 [ 32 ] or dl-apv [ 33 ] into ca1 impaired memory consolidation at doses of 0.5 mg/kg and 0.5 μg/mouse, respectively, to antagonize nmda receptor activity. mk-801 binds to the nmda ion channel, blocking ca 2+ influx, while dl-apv competes with glutamate for binding [ 34 ]. in the y-maze task with a blocked arm, both mk-801 and dl-apv groups showed decreased times of entries into the novel arms compared to controls [one-way anova, f (2, 32) = 32.16, p &lt; 0.0001; post hoc test: ctrl vs. mk801, p &lt; 0.0001; ctrl vs. dl-apv, p &lt; 0.0001; mk801 vs. dl-apv, n.s.] (fig. 5b ). in the water maze, in the probe test, both mk-801 and dl-apv groups exhibited significantly shorter time spent in the target quadrant compared with the control group [one-way anova, f (2, 29) = 5.976, p = 0.0067;

post hoc test: ctrl vs. mk801, p &lt; 0.05; ctrl vs. dl-apv, p &lt; 0.01; mk801 vs. dl-apv, n.s.] (fig. 5g ). to our knowledge, this is the first report of the impact of intradorsal hippocampal (ca1) injection of mk-801 and dl-apv effectively reducing hippocampal ltp, resulting in deficits in spatial learning and memory. these findings prove that nmda receptors in the hippocampus play a role in spatial learning and memory. although this approach offered insights into hippocampal nmda receptor signaling and neurocognitive deficits, it failed to address potential mechanisms acting during critical windows of neurodevelopment. fig. 5: effects of nmda receptor antagonists on the hippocampal ca1 ltp and spatial memory. a timeline of the experiment. the model was created using biorender. b the y-maze task with a blocked arm test examined the effects of mk-801 or dl-apv on spatial memory in mice. the data displays the time spent in the unfamiliar arm as the mean ± sem with individual value plots.

environment plays a crucial role in fetal programming per the dohad hypothesis [ 6 ]. in fig. s1 , we provided our model for maternal hfd exposure in utero impaired behavior in offspring. we provide evidence that feeding female mice an hfd during pre-mating and gestation is sufficient to impair spatial working memory and spatial memory, to cause depression-like behavior in offspring. our findings indicated the long-term effects of maternal hfd on neurocognitive functions, indicating that prenatal maternal hfd exposure can make individuals more susceptible to cognitive impairments later in life. changes in hippocampal synaptic plasticity were identified through electrophysiological studies. further, activation of nmda signaling rescues spatial learning and memory deficits in offspring of maternal hfd. animal behavioral testing results depend on the sex, age, and timeline of maternal hfd model implementation. previous studies failed to distinguish between the prenatal and postnatal effects of maternal hfd on offspring. in our animal model, newborns were reared by foster icr mothers with excellent maternal characteristics (e.g. nest building, pup retrieval behavior, nursing and grooming of the pups) [ 37 ] on a control diet during the lactation period, offering new insights into several aspects. pre-conception and pregnancy are critical periods for appropriately programming epigenetic mechanisms [ 38 ]. our experimental design using icr foster mothers during lactation provides a clearer understanding of the bona-fide in utero effects. notably, hfd negatively affects maternal behavior, such as nest building and pup retrieval [ 39 ]. in c57bl/6 mice, maternal hfd negatively affects mammopoiesis, milk production, and pup retrieval [ 40 ]. in our model, litters at gestation day (gd) 18.5 were significantly smaller in hfd mice than in control mice (fig. s2a ), indicating that the fecundity of hfd-fed mothers was compromised. consistent with previous studies [ 40 , 41 , 42 ], our maternal hfd model timeline was associated with poor pup survival in c57bl/6 mice (fig. s2b ). fostering hfd pups with icr mothers significantly improved their survival rates, but the number of live pups remained lower than that of the control group (fig. s2b ). therefore, foster icr mothers could protect newborns from inadequate maternal care in our maternal hfd model during lactation. we showed that in-utero exposure to maternal hfd resulted in persistent behavioral deficits even after returning to a normal diet during lactation and after weaning. nmda receptors comprise two nmdar1 subunits and two nmdar2 or nmdar3 subunits [ 43 ]. the role of nmda receptors in plasticity mechanisms related to recognition memory processes in the perirhinal cortex, hippocampus, temporal association cortex, and mpfc has been well-established [ 44 ]. our findings indicate maternal exposure to hfd in utero diminishes hippocampal nmda receptor and psd95 protein expression in the offspring, which displays deficits in hippocampal ltp. previous studies indicated that offspring of maternal hfd during pregnancy and lactation displayed impaired nmdar2a/ nmdar2b ratio in the hippocampus [ 45 , 46 ], and impaired ltp at ca3-ca1 synapses in offspring [ 20 , 21 ]. the precise mechanism by which prenatal exposure to hfd reduces hippocampal nmda receptor expression remains to be explored. in one study, maternal hfd alters fetal brain microrna expression which is associated with decreased nmdar expression [ 45 ]. in another study, maternal hfd negatively affects the synaptic plasticity of their offspring by epigenetically suppressing the expression of bdnf in the hippocampus [ 21 ]. more studies are required to decipher the mechanism by which maternal obesity affects nmda receptor expression in male offspring. for the first time, we provide evidence that daily acute administration of nmda into the hippocampal dg of hfd offspring activates nmda receptor signaling, producing a long-lasting effect that counteracts reduced ltp and improves cognitive function and memory impairments. in line with prior studies, our study provides clear evidence that prenatal maternal hfd exposure impacts the synaptic plasticity and cognitive behavior of offspring through the hippocampal nmda receptor pathways. our findings indicate that nmda receptors are necessary for the effects of maternal hfd on offspring learning and memory. antagonist experiments demonstrate that blocking nmda receptor signaling mitigates hippocampus-dependent tasks, underscoring their necessity in neurocognitive alterations observed in offspring exposed to maternal hfd. conversely, nmda receptor activation through nmda injections was sufficient to rescue hippocampus-dependent tasks in maternal hfd offspring, further supporting the involvement of nmda receptor activity in this process. these results suggest that nmda receptor dysregulation may underlie the learning and memory impairments associated with maternal hfd. collectively, our findings underscore the pivotal role of nmda receptors in the interplay between maternal diet and offspring cognitive function. the concentrations of nmda receptor antagonists and agonists were chosen based on prior research showing their effectiveness in modulating nmda receptor activity in vivo. these concentrations, while not physiological, are widely utilized as pharmacological tools to evaluate the role of nmda receptors in memory and synaptic plasticity. regarding the nmda concentration used for activation, the dose was chosen based on prior studies showing that this concentration effectively activates nmda receptors in vivo [ 36 ]. the potential mechanism underlying the long-term effects of acute nmda receptor activation involves synaptic plasticity, including ltp, which is critical for sustained changes in neuronal function and behavior. nmda receptor activation is well-known to facilitate calcium influx, triggering intracellular signaling cascades and gene transcription necessary for enduring synaptic modifications [ 47 ]. impaired neurogenesis in the adult hippocampus has been linked to learning and memory [ 48 ]. research has shown that maternal hfd consumed from preconception through lactation significantly impaired hippocampal neurogenesis in offspring [ 17 , 18 , 19 ]. in this study, we also found that in utero exposure to hfd leads to impaired hippocampal neurogenesis in offspring. although synaptic dysfunction and impaired neurogenesis may jointly contribute to neurobehavioral deficits in the offspring [ 49 , 50 ], our results indicate that daily acute administration of nmda into the hippocampal dg is sufficient to produce a long-lasting effect in rescuing cognitive function. these data suggested a potential mechanism through which nmda enhances synaptic plasticity or compensates for deficits in neurogenesis. furthermore, exploring the connection between synaptic plasticity and neurogenesis will provide a clearer understanding of the mechanisms behind the observed outcomes. epidemiological studies have revealed an association between maternal obesity and depression in their children [ 51 ]. previous research, including our own, has shown that maternal hfd can influence the offspring’s susceptibility to depression-like behavior [ 52 , 53 ]. a possible mechanism for this association is that maternal hfd impairs the development of the serotonergic and dopaminergic systems in offspring, which are crucial for regulating emotional behavior [ 51 , 54 , 55 ]. notably, these neurotransmitter systems also play a role in learning and memory [ 56 , 57 ]. serotonin enhances the activation of nmda receptors and facilitates the expression of ltp in the ca1 region [ 58 ]. dopamine modulates synaptic strength in neuronal circuits by influencing neuronal populations that drive ltp and ltd [ 59 ]. together, these results showed that maternal obesity has multiple effects on offspring’s neurodevelopment and leads to cognitive defects. in humans, sexual dimorphism exists, with male predominance in cases of adhd and female predominance in cases of overweight and obesity [ 11 , 60 , 61 ]. previous work already showed the sexually dimorphic effect of maternal obesity on neurodevelopment. neuroinflammatory responses, epigenetic regulation, gene expression patterns, and microglia and astrocyte cell function may jointly contribute to sexual dimorphism in neurodevelopmental disorders [ 8 , 62 , 63 , 64 ]. to examine the sexual differences in our model, we conducted a two-way anova with maternal diet and sex as factors to evaluate potential interactions. the analysis revealed no significant interaction, indicating that maternal diet effects were not strictly sex-dependent. however, male offspring exposed to maternal hfd showed substantial reductions in hippocampal psd95, nmdar1, and nmdar2 expression, along with decreased neurogenesis and impaired water maze performance (supplementary table 2 ). the mean differences in these measures were larger in males than in females, suggesting greater susceptibility of male offspring to maternal hfd-induced cognitive dysfunction (supplementary table 2 ). these findings highlight potential biological differences between sexes, warranting further research to elucidate the underlying mechanisms. in conclusion, our model enabled us to rigorously investigate the mechanisms underlying cognitive dysfunction in response to maternal hfd in utero. this is concerning because there is evidence of an increase in obesity among pregnant women and in the prevalence of childhood cognitive impairment [ 65 ]. unfortunately, pharmacological interventions can only partially alleviate neurological deficits [ 66 ]. our study identifies hippocampal nmda receptors linking prenatal maternal hfd exposure and offspring cognitive dysfunction, providing a basis for reducing the prevalence of prenatal maternal hfd exposure and cognitive impairment. limitation our study has some limitations. for example, returning to a regular diet during lactation and after weaning may alleviate some behavioral deficits. a study showed that dietary intervention during lactation can improve behavior and neuroinflammation in the offspring of obese mothers [ 67 ]. unlike previous research, we utilized a foster icr to raise newborns during lactation instead of altering the mother’s diet. future studies should use ultrasonic vocalizations (usv) to assess neurodevelopmental characteristics of prenatal development and understand that postnatal behavioral assessment reflects exposure to maternal hfd in utero [ 8 ]. one limitation in our design was the selective focus on hippocampal-dependent, anxiety-like, and depressive-like behaviors. attempts should be made to examine the impact of maternal hfd on offspring in different brain regions as well as regulatory pathways. data availability all data are

## Results
demonstrate that maternal hfd exposure in utero impaired spatial working memory and spatial memory, and also caused depression-like behavior in offspring. these behavioral abnormalities were associated with reduced hippocampal nmda receptor expression, diminished neurogenesis, and deficits in hippocampal long-term potentiation (ltp). in addition, intrahippocampal microinjection of nmda receptor antagonists that block nmda ion channels or compete for glutamate binding effectively reduces hippocampal long-term potentiation (ltp), resulting in deficits in spatial learning and memory. furthermore, microinjection of nmda into the hippocampus bilaterally activated nmda receptor signaling, leading to the amelioration of behavioral abnormalities in hfd offspring. in summary, alteration of hippocampal nmda receptors induced by prenatal maternal hfd exposure is associated with spatial learning and memory deficits in offspring.","datepublished":"2025-08-19t00:00:00z","datemodified":"2025-08-19t00:00:00z","pagestart":"1","pageend":"13","license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","sameas":"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41398-025-03520-2","keywords":["hippocampus","physiology","medicine/public health","general","psychiatry","neurosciences","behavioral sciences","pharmacotherapy","biological psychology"],"image":["https://media.springernature.com/lw1200/springer-static/image/art%3a10.1038%2fs41398-025-03520-2/mediaobjects/41398_2025_3520_fig1_html.png","https://media.springernature.com/lw1200/springer-static/image/art%3a10.1038%2fs41398-025-03520-2/mediaobjects/41398_2025_3520_fig2_html.png","https://media.springernature.com/lw1200/springer-static/image/art%3a10.1038%2fs41398-025-03520-2/mediaobjects/41398_2025_3520_fig3_html.png","https://media.springernature.com/lw1200/springer-static/image/art%3a10.1038%2fs41398-025-03520-2/mediaobjects/41398_2025_3520_fig4_html.png","https://media.springernature.com/lw1200/springer-static/image/art%3a10.1038%2fs41398-025-03520-2/mediaobjects/41398_2025_3520_fig5_html.png","https://media.springernature.com/lw1200/springer-static/image/art%3a10.1038%2fs41398-025-03520-2/mediaobjects/41398_2025_3520_fig6_html.png"],"ispartof":{"name":"translational psychiatry","issn":["2158-3188"],"volumenumber":"15","@type":["periodical","publicationvolume"]},"publisher":{"name":"nature publishing group uk","logo":{"url":"https://www.springernature.com/app-sn/public/images/logo-springernature.png","@type":"imageobject"},"@type":"organization"},"author":[{"name":"kuan-ru chen","affiliation":[{"name":"i-shou university","address":{"name":"department of medical research, e-da hospital, i-shou university, kaohsiung, taiwan","@type":"postaladdress"},"@type":"organization"}],"@type":"person"},{"name":"yu-cheng ho","affiliation":[{"name":"i-shou university","address":{"name":"school of medicine, college of medicine, i-shou university, kaohsiung city, taiwan","@type":"postaladdress"},"@type":"organization"}],"@type":"person"},{"name":"chih-wei huang","affiliation":[{"name":"i-shou university","address":{"name":"department of medical research, e-da hospital, i-shou university, kaohsiung, taiwan","@type":"postaladdress"},"@type":"organization"}],"@type":"person"},{"name":"lung yu","affiliation":[{"name":"national cheng kung university college of medicine","address":{"name":"department of physiology, national cheng kung university college of medicine, tainan, taiwan","@type":"postaladdress"},"@type":"organization"}],"@type":"person"},{"name":"pao-lin kuo","url":"http://orcid.org/0000-0002-0726-1030","affiliation":[{"name":"jen-ai hospital","address":{"name":"department of obstetrics and gynecology, jen-ai hospital, taichung, taiwan","@type":"postaladdress"},"@type":"organization"},{"name":"kaohsiung chang gung memorial hospital and chang gung university college of medicine","address":{"name":"department of obstetrics and gynecology, kaohsiung chang gung memorial hospital and chang gung university college of medicine, kaohsiung, taiwan","@type":"postaladdress"},"@type":"organization"},{"name":"national cheng kung university","address":{"name":"department of obstetrics and gynecology, national cheng kung university hospital, national cheng kung university, tainan, taiwan","@type":"postaladdress"},"@type":"organization"}],"email":"paolinkuo@gmail.com","@type":"person"}],"isaccessibleforfree":true,"@type":"scholarlyarticle"},"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"webpage"} window.eligibleforra21 = 'false';

(taipei, taiwan). mice were housed in groups of 2–5 in plastic cages in a temperature (23 ± 1 °c) and humidity (70%) controlled room with a 12-h light/dark cycle, lights on at 7:00 am. the mice had access to food and tap water ad libitum throughout the experiments. mice were randomly assigned to various diet groups. females were given either a control diet, which contained 13.5% kcal from fat, 28.5% kcal from protein, and 58% kcal from carbohydrate (labdiet 5010*, made by labdiet in st. louis, mo), or a high-fat diet (hfd), which contained 60.9% kcal from fat, 18.3% kcal from protein, and 20.1% kcal from carbohydrate (testdiet-58y1, made by testdiet in st. louis, mo). the subjects were given these diets for 8 weeks before mating and 3 weeks during gestation. female dams were randomly paired with control-diet male at 12 weeks. after delivery, c57bl/6 offspring (p0) were raised by icr dams on a controlled diet. to standardize competition for food and maternal attention, the litters were evenly culled to eight pups, regardless of gender. after weaning, the offspring were fed the control diet throughout the study. all behavioral tests were conducted on mice 6–8 weeks old. to investigate anxiety-like and depressive-like behaviors, open field tests and forced swimming tests were conducted on mice at 6 weeks old. y-maze and object location task were conducted on 7-week-old mice to assess working memory and spatial memory behaviors. morris water maze was conducted on 8-week-old mice to assess spatial memory behaviors. ethics approval and consent to participate the institutional animal care and use committee (ncku-iacuc-108189, ncku-iacuc-109061, and ncku-iacuc-110075) at national cheng kung university and iacuc (edah-112001, edah-112016, and edah-112018) at e-da hospital approved all animal protocols, and all animal experiments were conducted in accordance with the approved guidelines and regulations. open field test (oft) the oft is a dual assessment tool for evaluating anxiety levels and locomotor activity [ 22 ]. mice were placed within the central area of a white arena measuring 60 × 60 cm, with a height of 70 cm. the mice were tested in a random order. a video tracking system monitored the mice’s activity over 10 min. we divided the open field apparatus into nine equal squares. the squares near the walls of the open field arena were defined as outer zones, while the central square was defined as the central zone. ethovision xt tracking software (noldus information technology, the netherlands) was utilized to quantify locomotor activity. the open field arena was exposed to light at approximately 150 lux. the oft was performed from 9 a.m.–4 p.m., and all measurements of behaviors in the open field test were carried out by an observer who was blinded to the conditions. forced swimming test (fst) the fst was used to assess depressive-like behavior [ 23 ]. during this test, mice were placed individually in a clear cylinder (20 cm deep) filled with water maintained at 24 ± 1 °c. the mice were tested in a random order. mice were considered immobile when they floated upright with only slight movements to keep their heads above the water. by ‘only slight movement,’ we were referring to minimal movements of one or more limbs that are sufficient to keep the animal’s head above water. this behavior was classified as immobility, distinct from active swimming or struggling. the immobility time was measured by an observer who was unaware of the groups during the final 5 min of the 6-min testing period. we used a lighting level of 150 lux to illuminate the test room. the fst was performed from 9 a.m.–4 p.m., and all measurements of behaviors in the forced swimming test were carried out by an observer who was blinded to the conditions. the animals were recorded from a frontal perspective during the experiments, allowing us to clearly observe and analyze their swimming behaviors and immobility times. y-maze (arm alternation version) briefly, mice were placed in the maze’s center and allowed to explore the three arms for 5 min freely, and the entering sequence of the arms was recorded [ 24 ]. the mice were tested in a random order. the test was conducted under dim lighting, with an illumination level of less than 40 lux. the maze was cleaned with 70% ethanol between trials to remove olfactory cues. the y-maze test was performed from 9 a.m.–4 p.m., and all measurements of behaviors in the y-maze test were carried out by an observer who was blinded to the conditions. y-maze (arm exploration version) briefly, mice were placed in the center of the other maze and allowed to freely explore two arms (familiar arms) for 15 min. in contrast, the remaining arm was blocked (unfamiliar component). five minutes after the 15-min exploration, mice were allowed to explore the whole maze for 5 min, and each mouse’s time spent in an unfamiliar arm was recorded [ 24 ]. the mice were tested in a random order. the test was conducted under dim lighting, with an illumination level of less than 40 lux. the maze was cleaned with 70% ethanol between trials to remove olfactory cues. the y-maze test was performed from 9 a.m.–4 p.m., and all measurements of behaviors in the y-maze test were carried out by an observer who was blinded to the conditions. object location task in the 10-min sample phase, two identical objects were placed near the corners on one side of a plexiglas box that measures 46 × 26 × 21 cm. the box had black walls and a bright yellow floor and was situated in a dimly lit (&lt;40 lux) test room. the mice were tested in a random order. the mice were then placed in the arena and tasked with finding two identical objects. after that, the animals were removed from their cages and placed back into their transport cages. after a 5-min delay, the mice were placed in the chamber for a 5-min test. during the test, one of the objects was moved to a new location. the percentage of time spent exploring the new corner over exploring both objects determines recognition. the maze was cleaned with 70% ethanol between trials to remove olfactory cues. the object location task was performed from 9 a.m.–4 p.m., and all measurements of behaviors in the object location task were carried out by an observer who was blinded to the conditions. morris water maze the circular tank had a diameter of 80 cm and a height of 20 cm. it is filled with tap water, thermostatically controlled at 22 ± 1 °c, reaching a height of 10 cm. a 9 cm diameter platform was submerged 1 cm below the water surface. the test was conducted under dim lighting, with an illumination level of less than 40 lux. the platform was situated in the northwest quadrant, while mice were released randomly from the other three quadrants: southwest, southeast, and northeast. the experiment was conducted once every day for four consecutive days. the probe trial was conducted on the fifth day after the last training session. during the probe trial, the platform was removed, and the time the mice stayed in the targeted quadrant for 30 s was recorded by ethovision xt tracking software (noldus information technology, the netherlands). the duration and path of swimming were documented by ethovision xt tracking software (noldus information technology, the netherlands). the mice were tested in a random order. the morris water maze was performed from 9 a.m.–4 p.m., and all measurements of behaviors in the morris water maze were carried out by an observer who was blinded to the conditions. western blot mouse hippocampi, comprising both the dorsal and ventral regions, were dissected on ice and processed immediately as previously described [ 25 ]. briefly, tissue proteins were extracted from the whole hippocampus of control and hfd offspring at p8w. tissues were lysed in ripa buffer (20-188, millipore) with a protease inhibitor cocktail (roche, basel, switzerland). wb analyses were conducted as described previously [ 25 ]. anti-glua1(mab2263, millipore), anti-glua2 (ab1768-i, millipore), anti-mglur5 (ab76316, abcam), and anti-β actin (mab1501, millipore) antibodies were described previously [ 25 ]. anti-nmdar1 (ab109182, abcam), nmdar2 (gtx134086, genetex), psd95 (ab18258, abcam), synataxin 1a (ab41453, abcam), synaptotagmin (ab13259, abcam), and synapsin i (ab64581, abcam) were used for western blot. immunohistochemical staining to identify newly dividing cells in the hippocampal dg, we used ki67-staining methods as previously described [ 25 ]. the sections were incubated in cell conditioning 1 (cc1) for antigen retrieval and left there for 30 min. slices were incubated in mouse anti-ki67 (1/100) primary antibodies (ab15580, abcam) for 2 h. after washing with pbs, the sections were treated with the peroxidase-labeled anti-rabbit secondary antibody (histofine simple stain mouse max po, nichirei biosciences, cat no: 414341f) for 30 min and then underwent dab detection. the counterstain used was mayer’s hematoxylin. preparation and electrophysiology of hippocampal slices coronal slices of the hippocampus (300 μm) was extracted from adult male c57bl/6 mice following decapitation under isoflurane anesthesia. the dissected slices were recovered at room temperature for at least 1 h before being transferred to a submersion-type recording chamber. the chamber was consistently perfused with oxygenated (95% o 2 and 5% co 2 ) artificial cerebrospinal fluid (acsf) at a flow rate of 3–4 ml/min. the acsf composition was as follows (in mm): 117 nacl, 4.5 kcl, 2.5 cacl 2 , 1.2 mgcl 2 , 1.2 nah 2 po 4 , 25 nahco 3 , and ph = 7.4. extracellular recordings was conducted and analyzed using an axon setup (axon instruments, foster city, ca). all electrophysiological signals was sampled at 5–10 khz by pclamp software (version 11, axon instruments) through a multiclamp 700b amplifier and digidata 1550b ad converter and analyzed using clampfit software (version 11, axon instruments). evoked postsynaptic potentials was induced in ca1 stratum radiatum through electric stimulation (0.02 ms duration) of schaffer collateral/commissural afferents at 0.033 hz using a tungsten concentric bipolar microelectrode (wpi tm53ccins, sarasota, fl). field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fepsps) was recorded with a glass pipette filled with acsf (3–5 mω resistance). the strength of synaptic transmission was assessed by calculating the slope of fepsp. the high-frequency stimulation protocol inducing long-term potentiation (ltp) consists of four 0.5-s trains of 100-hz stimuli separated by 20 s. in each slice, fepsps was monitored for at least 20 min until stable fepsps are achieved. the average slope of fepsps recorded for 10 min served as the baseline of fepsp slope before ltp stimulation. the magnitude of ltp was determined by the average slope of 30 fepsps recorded 50–60 min after high-frequency stimulation (hfs) and expressed as a percentage of the baseline fepsp slope. stereotaxic injections mice were anesthetized and then placed in a stereotaxic frame. the area around the incision was trimmed, and the meninges were treated with 3% hydrogen peroxide. the bregma was identified as the origin, and solutions were injected bilaterally into the dg of the dorsal hippocampus using the following coordinates: (from bregma) anterior = −1.7 mm, lateral = ± 1.6 mm, (from skull surface) height = −0.16 mm. a concentrated solution of 2.0 μl was injected stereotaxically over 10 min using a 5-ml 33 s-gauge hamilton syringe. the needle was kept in place for 10 min and then slowly removed. the skin was closed using a silk suture. the mice were monitored during their recovery period. after a seven-day recovery period following cannulation, mice received microinjections of drugs prior to behavioral assessments. saline, mk-801 (0.5 mg/kg, once/day), dl-apv (0.5μg/kg, once/day), or nmda (1 μm, once/day), was microinjected into the dg of the dorsal hippocampus once daily for 12 days. in this experimental setting, we employed daily acute administration of the drugs to investigate their long-lasting effects on behavioral responses. behavioral tests were performed one week after the injection. mk-801(cat no:10009019,) and nmda (cat no:14581) were purchased from cayman. dl-apv (cat no: hb0252) was purchased from hello bio. statistics data were expressed as means ± sem. the analysis was performed using graphpad prism 6 (graphpad, la jolla, ca, usa), jasp (version 0.19.3.0; jasp team) and r software version 4.4.2. data were initially tested for normal distribution using the shapiro-wilk test and for homogeneity of variance using levene’s test (supplementary table 1 ). for data sets that met the criteria for parametric statistics, appropriate tests included student’s t-test (two-tailed), one-way anova with tukey’s post hoc test, or two-way anova with sidak’s post hoc test. for non-parametric data sets, we used the mann-whitney u test (two-tailed) for 2-group comparison, kruskal-wallis test with dunn’s post hoc tests, or the scheirer–ray–hare test followed by wilcoxon rank-sum tests with bonferroni correction for pairwise comparisons. the rout method with a q-coefficient of 1% was applied to identify potential outliers. results a mouse model investigating the effects of maternal hfd on the cognitive behaviors of offspring to investigate the impact of intrauterine exposure to maternal hfd, which conveys risks for cognitive behaviors in offspring, the experimental flowchart was shown in fig. 1a . female dams were fed the control or high-fat diet (hfd) for eight weeks. after eight weeks of dietary intervention, the dams fed an hfd had a significantly increased body weight compared to those fed the control diet (fig. 1b ). to assess the impact of maternal diet, female dams were paired with control-diet male dams at 12 weeks, and pregnant dams were maintained on control-diet or hfd throughout gestation. to prevent the effect of maternal hfd exposure during lactation, newborns were reared by foster icr mothers under control-diet conditions for the lactation period. after weaning, the mice were fed a control diet. mouse behavioral changes were tested, as shown in fig. 1a . fig. 1: maternal hfd exposure resulted in impaired spatial learning and memory in offspring. a

post hoc test: ctrl vs. mk801, n.s.; ctrl vs. dl-apv, n.s.; mk801 vs. dl-apv, n.s.] and crossing numbers [kruskal-wallis test, p = 0.7334; post hoc test: ctrl vs. mk801, n.s.; ctrl vs. dl-apv, n.s.; mk801 vs. dl-apv, n.s.] were observed in either mk-801 or f dl-apv groups (fig. 5d, e ). representative heat maps are shown in fig. 5f . long-term potentiation (ltp) is a form of synaptic plasticity that occurs at most synapses in the nervous system due to activity-dependent changes in synaptic transmission [ 35 ]. to assess the effects of mk801 and dl-apv on synaptic plasticity, we tested whether mk801 or dl-apv could successfully block the induction of timing-dependent ltp (t-ltp) in hippocampal slices. the slices were obtained from mice that received drug administration. the magnitude of hippocampal ca1 ltp in slices from mice receiving intrahippocampal microinjection of mk-801 or dl-apv showed a significantly reduced magnitude of ltp compared with the control group [one-way anova, f (2, 17) = 8.436, p = 0.0029; post hoc test: ctrl vs. mk801, p &lt; 0.05; ctrl vs. dl-apv, p &lt; 0.01; mk801 vs. dl-apv, n.s.] (fig. 5g ). to our knowledge, this is the first report of the impact of intradorsal hippocampal (ca1) injection of mk-801 and dl-apv effectively reducing hippocampal ltp, resulting in deficits in spatial learning and memory. these findings prove that nmda receptors in the hippocampus play a role in spatial learning and memory. although this approach offered insights into hippocampal nmda receptor signaling and neurocognitive deficits, it failed to address potential mechanisms acting during critical windows of neurodevelopment. fig. 5: effects of nmda receptor antagonists on the hippocampal ca1 ltp and spatial memory. a timeline of the experiment. the model was created using biorender. b the y-maze task with a blocked arm test examined the effects of mk-801 or dl-apv on spatial memory in mice. the data displays the time spent in the unfamiliar arm as the mean ± sem with individual value plots.

environment plays a crucial role in fetal programming per the dohad hypothesis [ 6 ]. in fig. s1 , we provided our model for maternal hfd exposure in utero impaired behavior in offspring. we provide evidence that feeding female mice an hfd during pre-mating and gestation is sufficient to impair spatial working memory and spatial memory, to cause depression-like behavior in offspring. our findings indicated the long-term effects of maternal hfd on neurocognitive functions, indicating that prenatal maternal hfd exposure can make individuals more susceptible to cognitive impairments later in life. changes in hippocampal synaptic plasticity were identified through electrophysiological studies. further, activation of nmda signaling rescues spatial learning and memory deficits in offspring of maternal hfd. animal behavioral testing results depend on the sex, age, and timeline of maternal hfd model implementation. previous studies failed to distinguish between the prenatal and postnatal effects of maternal hfd on offspring. in our animal model, newborns were reared by foster icr mothers with excellent maternal characteristics (e.g. nest building, pup retrieval behavior, nursing and grooming of the pups) [ 37 ] on a control diet during the lactation period, offering new insights into several aspects. pre-conception and pregnancy are critical periods for appropriately programming epigenetic mechanisms [ 38 ]. our experimental design using icr foster mothers during lactation provides a clearer understanding of the bona-fide in utero effects. notably, hfd negatively affects maternal behavior, such as nest building and pup retrieval [ 39 ]. in c57bl/6 mice, maternal hfd negatively affects mammopoiesis, milk production, and pup retrieval [ 40 ]. in our model, litters at gestation day (gd) 18.5 were significantly smaller in hfd mice than in control mice (fig. s2a ), indicating that the fecundity of hfd-fed mothers was compromised. consistent with previous studies [ 40 , 41 , 42 ], our maternal hfd model timeline was associated with poor pup survival in c57bl/6 mice (fig. s2b ). fostering hfd pups with icr mothers significantly improved their survival rates, but the number of live pups remained lower than that of the control group (fig. s2b ). therefore, foster icr mothers could protect newborns from inadequate maternal care in our maternal hfd model during lactation. we showed that in-utero exposure to maternal hfd resulted in persistent behavioral deficits even after returning to a normal diet during lactation and after weaning. nmda receptors comprise two nmdar1 subunits and two nmdar2 or nmdar3 subunits [ 43 ]. the role of nmda receptors in plasticity mechanisms related to recognition memory processes in the perirhinal cortex, hippocampus, temporal association cortex, and mpfc has been well-established [ 44 ]. our findings indicate maternal exposure to hfd in utero diminishes hippocampal nmda receptor and psd95 protein expression in the offspring, which displays deficits in hippocampal ltp. previous studies indicated that offspring of maternal hfd during pregnancy and lactation displayed impaired nmdar2a/ nmdar2b ratio in the hippocampus [ 45 , 46 ], and impaired ltp at ca3-ca1 synapses in offspring [ 20 , 21 ]. the precise mechanism by which prenatal exposure to hfd reduces hippocampal nmda receptor expression remains to be explored. in one study, maternal hfd alters fetal brain microrna expression which is associated with decreased nmdar expression [ 45 ]. in another study, maternal hfd negatively affects the synaptic plasticity of their offspring by epigenetically suppressing the expression of bdnf in the hippocampus [ 21 ]. more studies are required to decipher the mechanism by which maternal obesity affects nmda receptor expression in male offspring. for the first time, we provide evidence that daily acute administration of nmda into the hippocampal dg of hfd offspring activates nmda receptor signaling, producing a long-lasting effect that counteracts reduced ltp and improves cognitive function and memory impairments. in line with prior studies, our study provides clear evidence that prenatal maternal hfd exposure impacts the synaptic plasticity and cognitive behavior of offspring through the hippocampal nmda receptor pathways. our findings indicate that nmda receptors are necessary for the effects of maternal hfd on offspring learning and memory. antagonist experiments demonstrate that blocking nmda receptor signaling mitigates hippocampus-dependent tasks, underscoring their necessity in neurocognitive alterations observed in offspring exposed to maternal hfd. conversely, nmda receptor activation through nmda injections was sufficient to rescue hippocampus-dependent tasks in maternal hfd offspring, further supporting the involvement of nmda receptor activity in this process. these results suggest that nmda receptor dysregulation may underlie the learning and memory impairments associated with maternal hfd. collectively, our findings underscore the pivotal role of nmda receptors in the interplay between maternal diet and offspring cognitive function. the concentrations of nmda receptor antagonists and agonists were chosen based on prior research showing their effectiveness in modulating nmda receptor activity in vivo. these concentrations, while not physiological, are widely utilized as pharmacological tools to evaluate the role of nmda receptors in memory and synaptic plasticity. regarding the nmda concentration used for activation, the dose was chosen based on prior studies showing that this concentration effectively activates nmda receptors in vivo [ 36 ]. the potential mechanism underlying the long-term effects of acute nmda receptor activation involves synaptic plasticity, including ltp, which is critical for sustained changes in neuronal function and behavior. nmda receptor activation is well-known to facilitate calcium influx, triggering intracellular signaling cascades and gene transcription necessary for enduring synaptic modifications [ 47 ]. impaired neurogenesis in the adult hippocampus has been linked to learning and memory [ 48 ]. research has shown that maternal hfd consumed from preconception through lactation significantly impaired hippocampal neurogenesis in offspring [ 17 , 18 , 19 ]. in this study, we also found that in utero exposure to hfd leads to impaired hippocampal neurogenesis in offspring. although synaptic dysfunction and impaired neurogenesis may jointly contribute to neurobehavioral deficits in the offspring [ 49 , 50 ], our results indicate that daily acute administration of nmda into the hippocampal dg is sufficient to produce a long-lasting effect in rescuing cognitive function. these data suggested a potential mechanism through which nmda enhances synaptic plasticity or compensates for deficits in neurogenesis. furthermore, exploring the connection between synaptic plasticity and neurogenesis will provide a clearer understanding of the mechanisms behind the observed outcomes. epidemiological studies have revealed an association between maternal obesity and depression in their children [ 51 ]. previous research, including our own, has shown that maternal hfd can influence the offspring’s susceptibility to depression-like behavior [ 52 , 53 ]. a possible mechanism for this association is that maternal hfd impairs the development of the serotonergic and dopaminergic systems in offspring, which are crucial for regulating emotional behavior [ 51 , 54 , 55 ]. notably, these neurotransmitter systems also play a role in learning and memory [ 56 , 57 ]. serotonin enhances the activation of nmda receptors and facilitates the expression of ltp in the ca1 region [ 58 ]. dopamine modulates synaptic strength in neuronal circuits by influencing neuronal populations that drive ltp and ltd [ 59 ]. together, these results showed that maternal obesity has multiple effects on offspring’s neurodevelopment and leads to cognitive defects. in humans, sexual dimorphism exists, with male predominance in cases of adhd and female predominance in cases of overweight and obesity [ 11 , 60 , 61 ]. previous work already showed the sexually dimorphic effect of maternal obesity on neurodevelopment. neuroinflammatory responses, epigenetic regulation, gene expression patterns, and microglia and astrocyte cell function may jointly contribute to sexual dimorphism in neurodevelopmental disorders [ 8 , 62 , 63 , 64 ]. to examine the sexual differences in our model, we conducted a two-way anova with maternal diet and sex as factors to evaluate potential interactions. the analysis revealed no significant interaction, indicating that maternal diet effects were not strictly sex-dependent. however, male offspring exposed to maternal hfd showed substantial reductions in hippocampal psd95, nmdar1, and nmdar2 expression, along with decreased neurogenesis and impaired water maze performance (supplementary table 2 ). the mean differences in these measures were larger in males than in females, suggesting greater susceptibility of male offspring to maternal hfd-induced cognitive dysfunction (supplementary table 2 ). these findings highlight potential biological differences between sexes, warranting further research to elucidate the underlying mechanisms. in conclusion, our model enabled us to rigorously investigate the mechanisms underlying cognitive dysfunction in response to maternal hfd in utero. this is concerning because there is evidence of an increase in obesity among pregnant women and in the prevalence of childhood cognitive impairment [ 65 ]. unfortunately, pharmacological interventions can only partially alleviate neurological deficits [ 66 ]. our study identifies hippocampal nmda receptors linking prenatal maternal hfd exposure and offspring cognitive dysfunction, providing a basis for reducing the prevalence of prenatal maternal hfd exposure and cognitive impairment. limitation our study has some limitations. for example, returning to a regular diet during lactation and after weaning may alleviate some behavioral deficits. a study showed that dietary intervention during lactation can improve behavior and neuroinflammation in the offspring of obese mothers [ 67 ]. unlike previous research, we utilized a foster icr to raise newborns during lactation instead of altering the mother’s diet. future studies should use ultrasonic vocalizations (usv) to assess neurodevelopmental characteristics of prenatal development and understand that postnatal behavioral assessment reflects exposure to maternal hfd in utero [ 8 ]. one limitation in our design was the selective focus on hippocampal-dependent, anxiety-like, and depressive-like behaviors. attempts should be made to examine the impact of maternal hfd on offspring in different brain regions as well as regulatory pathways. data availability all data are

## Discussion
the intrauterine environment plays a crucial role in fetal programming per the dohad hypothesis [ 6 ]. in fig. s1 , we provided our model for maternal hfd exposure in utero impaired behavior in offspring. we provide evidence that feeding female mice an hfd during pre-mating and gestation is sufficient to impair spatial working memory and spatial memory, to cause depression-like behavior in offspring. our findings indicated the long-term effects of maternal hfd on neurocognitive functions, indicating that prenatal maternal hfd exposure can make individuals more susceptible to cognitive impairments later in life. changes in hippocampal synaptic plasticity were identified through electrophysiological studies. further, activation of nmda signaling rescues spatial learning and memory deficits in offspring of maternal hfd. animal behavioral testing results depend on the sex, age, and timeline of maternal hfd model implementation. previous studies failed to distinguish between the prenatal and postnatal effects of maternal hfd on offspring. in our animal model, newborns were reared by foster icr mothers with excellent maternal characteristics (e.g. nest building, pup retrieval behavior, nursing and grooming of the pups) [ 37 ] on a control diet during the lactation period, offering new insights into several aspects. pre-conception and pregnancy are critical periods for appropriately programming epigenetic mechanisms [ 38 ]. our experimental design using icr foster mothers during lactation provides a clearer understanding of the bona-fide in utero effects. notably, hfd negatively affects maternal behavior, such as nest building and pup retrieval [ 39 ]. in c57bl/6 mice, maternal hfd negatively affects mammopoiesis, milk production, and pup retrieval [ 40 ]. in our model, litters at gestation day (gd) 18.5 were significantly smaller in hfd mice than in control mice (fig. s2a ), indicating that the fecundity of hfd-fed mothers was compromised. consistent with previous studies [ 40 , 41 , 42 ], our maternal hfd model timeline was associated with poor pup survival in c57bl/6 mice (fig. s2b ). fostering hfd pups with icr mothers significantly improved their survival rates, but the number of live pups remained lower than that of the control group (fig. s2b ). therefore, foster icr mothers could protect newborns from inadequate maternal care in our maternal hfd model during lactation. we showed that in-utero exposure to maternal hfd resulted in persistent behavioral deficits even after returning to a normal diet during lactation and after weaning. nmda receptors comprise two nmdar1 subunits and two nmdar2 or nmdar3 subunits [ 43 ]. the role of nmda receptors in plasticity mechanisms related to recognition memory processes in the perirhinal cortex, hippocampus, temporal association cortex, and mpfc has been well-established [ 44 ]. our findings indicate maternal exposure to hfd in utero diminishes hippocampal nmda receptor and psd95 protein expression in the offspring, which displays deficits in hippocampal ltp. previous studies indicated that offspring of maternal hfd during pregnancy and lactation displayed impaired nmdar2a/ nmdar2b ratio in the hippocampus [ 45 , 46 ], and impaired ltp at ca3-ca1 synapses in offspring [ 20 , 21 ]. the precise mechanism by which prenatal exposure to hfd reduces hippocampal nmda receptor expression remains to be explored. in one study, maternal hfd alters fetal brain microrna expression which is associated with decreased nmdar expression [ 45 ]. in another study, maternal hfd negatively affects the synaptic plasticity of their offspring by epigenetically suppressing the expression of bdnf in the hippocampus [ 21 ]. more studies are required to decipher the mechanism by which maternal obesity affects nmda receptor expression in male offspring. for the first time, we provide evidence that daily acute administration of nmda into the hippocampal dg of hfd offspring activates nmda receptor signaling, producing a long-lasting effect that counteracts reduced ltp and improves cognitive function and memory impairments. in line with prior studies, our study provides clear evidence that prenatal maternal hfd exposure impacts the synaptic plasticity and cognitive behavior of offspring through the hippocampal nmda receptor pathways. our findings indicate that nmda receptors are necessary for the effects of maternal hfd on offspring learning and memory. antagonist experiments demonstrate that blocking nmda receptor signaling mitigates hippocampus-dependent tasks, underscoring their necessity in neurocognitive alterations observed in offspring exposed to maternal hfd. conversely, nmda receptor activation through nmda injections was sufficient to rescue hippocampus-dependent tasks in maternal hfd offspring, further supporting the involvement of nmda receptor activity in this process. these results suggest that nmda receptor dysregulation may underlie the learning and memory impairments associated with maternal hfd. collectively, our findings underscore the pivotal role of nmda receptors in the interplay between maternal diet and offspring cognitive function. the concentrations of nmda receptor antagonists and agonists were chosen based on prior research showing their effectiveness in modulating nmda receptor activity in vivo. these concentrations, while not physiological, are widely utilized as pharmacological tools to evaluate the role of nmda receptors in memory and synaptic plasticity. regarding the nmda concentration used for activation, the dose was chosen based on prior studies showing that this concentration effectively activates nmda receptors in vivo [ 36 ]. the potential mechanism underlying the long-term effects of acute nmda receptor activation involves synaptic plasticity, including ltp, which is critical for sustained changes in neuronal function and behavior. nmda receptor activation is well-known to facilitate calcium influx, triggering intracellular signaling cascades and gene transcription necessary for enduring synaptic modifications [ 47 ]. impaired neurogenesis in the adult hippocampus has been linked to learning and memory [ 48 ]. research has shown that maternal hfd consumed from preconception through lactation significantly impaired hippocampal neurogenesis in offspring [ 17 , 18 , 19 ]. in this study, we also found that in utero exposure to hfd leads to impaired hippocampal neurogenesis in offspring. although synaptic dysfunction and impaired neurogenesis may jointly contribute to neurobehavioral deficits in the offspring [ 49 , 50 ], our results indicate that daily acute administration of nmda into the hippocampal dg is sufficient to produce a long-lasting effect in rescuing cognitive function. these data suggested a potential mechanism through which nmda enhances synaptic plasticity or compensates for deficits in neurogenesis. furthermore, exploring the connection between synaptic plasticity and neurogenesis will provide a clearer understanding of the mechanisms behind the observed outcomes. epidemiological studies have revealed an association between maternal obesity and depression in their children [ 51 ]. previous research, including our own, has shown that maternal hfd can influence the offspring’s susceptibility to depression-like behavior [ 52 , 53 ]. a possible mechanism for this association is that maternal hfd impairs the development of the serotonergic and dopaminergic systems in offspring, which are crucial for regulating emotional behavior [ 51 , 54 , 55 ]. notably, these neurotransmitter systems also play a role in learning and memory [ 56 , 57 ]. serotonin enhances the activation of nmda receptors and facilitates the expression of ltp in the ca1 region [ 58 ]. dopamine modulates synaptic strength in neuronal circuits by influencing neuronal populations that drive ltp and ltd [ 59 ]. together, these results showed that maternal obesity has multiple effects on offspring’s neurodevelopment and leads to cognitive defects. in humans, sexual dimorphism exists, with male predominance in cases of adhd and female predominance in cases of overweight and obesity [ 11 , 60 , 61 ]. previous work already showed the sexually dimorphic effect of maternal obesity on neurodevelopment. neuroinflammatory responses, epigenetic regulation, gene expression patterns, and microglia and astrocyte cell function may jointly contribute to sexual dimorphism in neurodevelopmental disorders [ 8 , 62 , 63 , 64 ]. to examine the sexual differences in our model, we conducted a two-way anova with maternal diet and sex as factors to evaluate potential interactions. the analysis revealed no significant interaction, indicating that maternal diet effects were not strictly sex-dependent. however, male offspring exposed to maternal hfd showed substantial reductions in hippocampal psd95, nmdar1, and nmdar2 expression, along with decreased neurogenesis and impaired water maze performance (supplementary table 2 ). the mean differences in these measures were larger in males than in females, suggesting greater susceptibility of male offspring to maternal hfd-induced cognitive dysfunction (supplementary table 2 ). these findings highlight potential biological differences between sexes, warranting further research to elucidate the underlying mechanisms. in conclusion, our model enabled us to rigorously investigate the mechanisms underlying cognitive dysfunction in response to maternal hfd in utero. this is concerning because there is evidence of an increase in obesity among pregnant women and in the prevalence of childhood cognitive impairment [ 65 ]. unfortunately, pharmacological interventions can only partially alleviate neurological deficits [ 66 ]. our study identifies hippocampal nmda receptors linking prenatal maternal hfd exposure and offspring cognitive dysfunction, providing a basis for reducing the prevalence of prenatal maternal hfd exposure and cognitive impairment. limitation our study has some limitations. for example, returning to a regular diet during lactation and after weaning may alleviate some behavioral deficits. a study showed that dietary intervention during lactation can improve behavior and neuroinflammation in the offspring of obese mothers [ 67 ]. unlike previous research, we utilized a foster icr to raise newborns during lactation instead of altering the mother’s diet. future studies should use ultrasonic vocalizations (usv) to assess neurodevelopmental characteristics of prenatal development and understand that postnatal behavioral assessment reflects exposure to maternal hfd in utero [ 8 ]. one limitation in our design was the selective focus on hippocampal-dependent, anxiety-like, and depressive-like behaviors. attempts should be made to examine the impact of maternal hfd on offspring in different brain regions as well as regulatory pathways. data availability all data are available in the main text or the supplementary materials. references creanga aa, catalano pm, bateman bt. obesity in pregnancy. n engl j med.
