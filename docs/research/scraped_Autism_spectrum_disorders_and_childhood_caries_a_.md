## Abstract

This study aimed to investigate the causal relationships between autism spectrum disorder (ASD) or pervasive developmental disorder (PDD) (excluding ASD and Asperger's syndrome [AS]) and childhood caries (primary teeth and permanent teeth).
We conducted two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis by utilizing summary-level data of ASD and PDD (excluding ASD and AS) as exposures, and childhood caries (primary teeth and permanent teeth) as outcomes.
The results showed that PDD (excluding ASD and AS) to be causally associated with caries in permanent teeth according to the inverse-variance weighted (IVW) (odds ratio [OR]: 1.151, 95%CI: 1.043-1.270, P = 0.005) and weighted median (OR: 1.159, 95%CI: 1.029-1.306, P = 0.015). However, according to the IVW (OR: 0.923, 95%CI: 0.873-1.003, P = 0.051), ASD might be causally associated with caries in permanent teeth. The results also showed no causal association between ASD or PDD (excluding ASD and AS) and caries in primary teeth.
Our study showed PDD (excluding ASD and AS) to have pathogenic effects on childhood caries of permanent teeth among a population of European ancestry. However, ASD was shown to have protective effects on childhood caries of permanent teeth.

However, ASD was shown to have protective effects on childhood caries of permanent teeth.Peer Review reportsBackgroundAutism spectrum disorder (ASD), a representative disorder of pervasive developmental disorder (PDD), is a complex developmental disorder characterized by difficulties in social communication, repetitive behaviors, and, often, restricted interests [1,2]. With onset typically occurring in children and adolescents, ASD represents a diverse range of conditions that can vary significantly in severity and manifestation. This neurodevelopmental disorder is deeply rooted in the intricate workings of the brain, and clinical studies have consistently revealed its strong genetic heterogeneity, indicating that multiple genetic factors contribute to its development [1]. Childhood caries, commonly referred to as dental cavities or tooth decay, is one of the most prevalent chronic diseases in children. It can be categorized into primary teeth caries (affecting deciduous teeth) and permanent teeth caries (affecting adult teeth). The clinical presentation of childhood caries typically includes visible signs of tooth decay such as white spots, brown or black discoloration, and cavitation of the teeth. Symptoms may include pain, sensitivity, or difficulty in eating, especially when the decay reaches an advanced stage [3,4]. Early diagnosis and intervention are crucial in preventing further complications such as infections and potential tooth loss.While remarkable progress has been made in understanding and supporting individuals with ASD, the disorder still poses significant challenges. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States has released findings indicating that the prevalence of ASD among children aged 0–8 years has risen from 1 in 54 in 2018 [5] to 1 in 36 in 2020 [6]. Most research studies have indicated that children with ASD exhibit poorer oral hygiene and gum health compared to the general population [7,8]. Additionally, one of the primary characteristics of individuals with ASD is inflexibility, poor communication skills, and repetitive behavior. Changes in the oral environment or oral diseases can potentially trigger sudden outbursts of anger in these individuals [9]. Poor oral hygiene can lead to various issues, including sleep disorders. Dental treatment for individuals with ASD often requires anesthesia, which poses a significant economic burden on the families of these individuals [8].Given the rising prevalence of autism and the increasing awareness of oral health needs in this population [10,11,12], the significance of oral health among individuals with autism has become increasingly prominent. Consequently, we conducted a Mendelian randomization study on ASD and childhood dental caries, aiming to provide data for making oral hygiene care recommendations tailored to the autism community. In addition, we explored the causal association between excluding ASD and Asperger’s syndrome (AS) in PDD and childhood dental caries in the study. Specifically, we hypothesize that Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and Pervasive Developmental Disorder (PDD), excluding ASD and Asperger’s syndrome (AS), are causally linked to childhood caries through different mechanisms. In ASD, poor oral hygiene and behavioral inflexibility may contribute to an increased risk of dental caries, while in PDD (excluding ASD and AS), sensory processing difficulties and rigid behaviors may lead to similar oral health challenges [13,14]. Previous epidemiological and genetic studies suggest that a causal relationship may exist between these disorders and poor oral health, which we aim to investigate further using Mendelian randomization methodology to minimize confounding factors and provide more accurate insights [15,16,17].MethodsStudy overviewWe performed a two-sample MR study to examine the possible causal effects of ASD or PDD (excluding ASD and AS) on childhood caries (primary teeth and permanent teeth), respectively. The outline of the study design is shown in Fig.1. This study adheres to the guidelines set forth in the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology Using Mendelian Randomization (STROBE-MR) statement. We have ensured that all methods align with the key principles outlined in this checklist for Mendelian randomization studies [18].Fig. 1Study design. Assumption 1: the exposures are significantly related to genetic instruments; Assumption 2: genetic tools are independent of confounding variables; Assumption 3: genetic tools are not linked to outcomes and only impact them through exposures. ALSPAC: the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children study; ASD: autism spectrum disorder; AS: Asperger’s syndrome; IVW: inverse-variance weighted; LD: linkage disequilibrium; MR: Mendelian randomization; PDD: pervasive developmental disorder; SNP: single nucleotide polymorphismsFull size imageData sourceGWAS summary statistics of ASD and PDD (excluding ASD and AS)Gene-exposure data of ASD and PDD (excluding ASD and AS) were available from the FinnGen study (https://r9.finngen.fi/), comprising 564 cases and 277,526 controls of European ancestry and 289 cases and 373,484 controls of European ancestry, respectively. The cases of ASD were defined using the International Classification of Diseases-9th version (ICD-9) code of 2990 and the ICD-10th version (ICD-10) code of F84.0 of F84.5, while the cases of PDD (excluding ASD and AS) were defined using the ICD-9 code of 2998 or 2999B and the ICD-10 code of F84 (excluding F84.0, F84.1, and F84.5) (Table1). In this study, we selected single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that were robustly associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) or pervasive developmental disorder (PDD) as exposures, based on previous genetic association studies. SNPs were chosen if they had a significant association with ASD or PDD, with no direct influence on the outcome (childhood caries). Additionally, SNPs were required to show independent effects, and their effects on potential confounders were carefully assessed to ensure the robustness of the Mendelian randomization analysis.Table 1 Overview of databases of exposure and outcome dataFull size tableIn our analysis, we used the traditional classification of PDD (excluding ASD and AS) to examine its causal relationship with childhood caries. We acknowledge that in recent diagnostic frameworks such as the DSM-5 and ICD-11, PDD has been subsumed under the broader category of ASD. The exclusion of Asperger’s syndrome (AS) in our study was based on clinical considerations, as AS is often characterized by relatively mild social communication challenges and higher cognitive functioning compared to other forms of ASD. This distinction was relevant to our research hypothesis that aimed to investigate the non-ASD forms of developmental disorders and their potential associations with childhood caries.However, we fully recognize that the current diagnostic standards have unified PDD and its subtypes, including AS, under the ASD umbrella, which may create a disparity between our study’s terminology and the latest diagnostic criteria. To address this limitation, we have explicitly stated the rationale for this classification approach and its potential divergence from the DSM-5 and ICD-11 criteria. We hope that future studies in this area will continue to refine the classification and align with the most recent standards.GWAS summary statistics of childhood caries (primary teeth and permanent teeth)Gene-outcome data of childhood caries (primary teeth and permanent teeth) were derived from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children study (ALSPAC) [19], which comprised participants of European ancestry aged 3.0–18.0 years. The caries in primary or permanent teeth were defined by clinical examination or questionnaires. For caries in primary teeth, the sample size of European ancestry was 9502 (3631 cases and 5871 controls), while that for caries in permanent teeth was 9781 (3193 cases and 6588 controls) (Table1and Supplementary TableS1). The data is available athttps://data.bris.ac.uk/datasets/pkqcnil6e9ju2nyreblt3mvwf/summary_statistics/.Instrumental variable selectionBased on the significance threshold ofP< 1 × 10− 8, the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that correlated with the exposures (ASD, or PDD excluding ASD and AS) were selected. Subsequently, the SNPs met the criteria of the linkage disequilibrium (LD) r2< 0.001 within 10,000 kb distance. The F statistic of each SNP was calculated, and the weak instrumental SNPs (F < 10) were discarded. In addition, palindromic SNPs with intermediate-effect allele frequencies were excluded. Finally, the preserved SNPs were used as the instrumental variables (IVs) in this study.Statistical analysisIn this study, two-sample MR analysis was performed using the TwoSampleMR package in R version 4.0.1. The inverse variance weighted (IVW) with random-effect model was employed as the primary MR analysis method, but, four other methods were performed to test the robustness of the results by IVW: MR-Egger, weighted median, weighted mode, and simple mode. Heterogeneity was estimated by IVW and MR-Egger. Horizontal pleiotropy was assessed using the MR-Egger intercept to avoid potential horizontal pleiotropy driving the MR results. Leave-one-out analysis was also carried out to rule out the possibility that the causal relationship was caused by a single SNP. A p-value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. The power calculations for the IVW estimates were performed using the online tool based on mRnd (https://shiny.cnsgenomics.com/mRnd/). The power calculation result 83.7% showed sufficient statistical power, with the recommended percentage for this result being 80% or over.ResultsInstrumental variablesIn this study, a total of 12 and 4 SNPs were selected as instrumental variables (IVs). Subsequently, we performed an MR-PRESSO outlier detection, which resulted in the extraction of 11 ASD-related SNPs and 3 PDD (excluding ASD and AS)-related SNPs from the FinnGen study, with no linkage disequilibrium (LD) detected. These SNPs were utilized as IVs. All selected SNPs had F-statistics greater than 10, indicating that the chosen instrumental variables were strong (Supplementary TableS2).MR estimates of ASD on caries in primary teeth and permanent teethThe causal estimation of ASD on primary teeth caries was analyzed using five methods, with the results presented in a forest plot (Fig.2, Supplementary FigureS1, and TableS3). The IVW method did not support a causal association between ASD and primary teeth caries, showing no evidence of causality (OR: 1.000, 95% CI: 0.932–1.073,P= 0.995). Similarly, the results from the other four MR analysis methods also did not demonstrate a causal link between ASD and primary teeth caries (P> 0.05). Additionally, no significant directional horizontal pleiotropy or heterogeneity was observed (Supplementary TableS4). Sensitivity analysis confirmed the stability of the causal effect.Fig. 2Causal effects of ASD related to caries in primary teeth and permanent teeth. Summary MR estimates derived from the IVW method. MR: Mendelian randomization; IVW: inverse-variance weightedFull size imageThe causal estimation of ASD on permanent teeth caries was assessed through five methods, with results presented in a forest plot (Fig.2, Supplementary FigureS2, and TableS3). Notably, the IVW method indicated a potential causal association between ASD and permanent teeth caries (OR: 0.923, 95% CI: 0.873–1.003,P= 0.051), though this effect approached statistical significance. The results from the other four MR methods did not show a significant causal relationship between ASD and permanent teeth caries (P> 0.05). Heterogeneity tests in IVW and MR-Egger, as well as the pleiotropy test in the MR-Egger intercept, yielded results greater than 0.05 (Supplementary TableS4). Leave-one-out analysis suggested the potential influence of a single SNP driving the causal association between ASD and permanent teeth caries.MR estimates of PDD (excluding ASD and AS) on caries in primary teeth and permanent teethThe causal estimation of PDD (excluding ASD and AS) on primary teeth caries was evaluated using five methods, with the results shown in a forest plot (Fig.3, Supplementary FigureS3, and TableS3). The IVW method did not detect a causal relationship between PDD (excluding ASD and AS) and primary teeth caries (OR: 1.000, 95% CI: 0.909-1.100,P= 0.998). Similarly, the results from the other four MR analysis methods did not show a causal association between PDD (excluding ASD and AS) and primary teeth caries (P> 0.05). No significant heterogeneity or pleiotropy was found (Supplementary TableS4). MR-PRESSO (P> 0.05), Cochran’s Q test (P> 0.05), and MR-Egger intercept tests (P> 0.05) indicated the absence of heterogeneity and pleiotropy (Supplementary TableS4). Leave-one-out analysis further confirmed that no single SNP contributed to bias in the MR estimates.Fig. 3Causal effects of PDD related to caries in primary teeth and permanent teeth. Summary MR estimates derived from the IVW method. The error bars represent 95% confidence intervals. MR: Mendelian randomization; IVW: inverse-variance weightedFull size imageThe causal estimation of PDD (excluding ASD and AS) on permanent teeth caries was analyzed through five methods, with results presented in a forest plot (Fig.3, Supplementary FigureS4, and TableS3). We identified a causal relationship between PDD (excluding ASD and AS) and permanent teeth caries, with the IVW analysis showing an OR of 1.151 (95% CI: 1.043–1.270,P= 0.005), and the weighted median method yielding an OR of 1.159 (95% CI: 1.029–1.306,P= 0.015). The other three MR methods did not indicate a causal association (P> 0.05). No significant directional horizontal pleiotropy or heterogeneity was found (Supplementary TableS4). Leave-one-out analysis further confirmed the robustness of these results.DiscussionEpidemiological evidence suggests an association between ASD and dental caries in children [20,21,22]. Whether there is a negative or positive correlation between ASD and childhood caries remains controversial. Kimberly J et al. further reported that about half the caregivers of children with ASD endorsed oral health fatalism (OHF), with Hispanic caregivers endorsing OHF to a greater extent [23]. Some studies have suggested that children with neurodevelopmental disorders, such as ASD and PDD, may have a higher risk of developing caries due to difficulties with oral hygiene, dietary preferences, and behavioral issues [24,25]. It’s worth noting that the risk of bias in observational research is a major obstacle to confirming this association. However, there have been no studies exploring the causal relationship between ASD or PDD (excluding ASD and AS) and childhood caries. Mendelian randomization (MR) is a powerful tool for inferring causal relationships, as it uses genetic variants as instrumental variables to minimize confounding and reverse causality. Compared to traditional observational studies, MR offers several advantages, including reduced bias from confounding factors, the ability to assess causality more directly, and the use of summary-level genetic data, which allows for large-scale studies with greater statistical power. MR provides a more reliable estimate of causal effects than correlation-based approaches, making it particularly useful in investigating complex diseases like ASD and childhood caries.To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to reveal the causal association of ASD or PDD (excluding ASD and AS) on childhood caries (primary teeth and permanent teeth). In our study, we conducted a two-sample MR approach to explore the potential causal relationships between ASD or PDD (excluding ASD and AS) and childhood caries (primary teeth and permanent teeth). Our findings suggest that PDD (excluding ASD and AS) is as a risk factor and causally associated with caries in permanent teeth. And the causal association of ADD on caries in permanent teeth is a strongly tendency towards statistical significance (P= 0.051). However, the results showed that no causal association was detected between ASD or PDD (excluding ASD and AS) and caries in primary teeth. The current study provides a foundation to explore ASD or PDD (excluding ASD and AS) risk factors of childhood caries (primary teeth and permanent teeth) from the perspective of genetic mechanisms, which can guide future analyses for ASD or PDD (excluding ASD and AS).Childhood caries is a prevalent and preventable oral health issue affecting children worldwide. In particular, it poses significant challenges for children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and pervasive developmental disorders (PDD), which are associated with a variety of behavioral, dietary, and medical issues that could influence oral health. Previous studies have shown that children with ASD often exhibit a higher incidence of dental caries due to difficulties in maintaining proper oral hygiene, dietary preferences, and limited access to dental care. Our study found that PDD (excluding ASD and AS) had a significant causal association with caries in permanent teeth, suggesting that this disorder might contribute to the development of caries in this population. However, ASD was shown to potentially have a protective effect on permanent teeth caries, which may be related to unique behavioral characteristics, such as dietary restrictions or particular health management practices. Further research should explore these behavioral and biological mechanisms in detail. The clinical implications of these findings are important. Early detection of oral health issues and preventive interventions, including dental care education and tailored treatment plans, should be integrated into the management strategies for children with ASD and PDD. Understanding the complex interactions between these developmental disorders and oral health is crucial for improving the overall well-being of these children.In our study, there was no causal association between ASD or PDD (excluding ASD and AS) and caries in primary teeth, nor between ASD and caries in permanent teeth. A previous study reported that the prevalence of total untreated dental caries among youth aged 2–5 was lower than it was among youth aged 6–19 [26], and 60-month-old children with higher genetic susceptibility to primary tooth decay were not associated with an increased rate of primary tooth decay [27]. Considering a report that 24-month-old children with a cariogenic salivary bacterial community state type were associated with caries in primary teeth [21], we speculated that cariogenic salivary bacterial community state type might be a greater contributor to caries in primary teeth. Several studies reported that children with autism exhibited a higher caries prevalence than the non-autistic healthy control group [28,29], while another group noticed that children with autism showed less caries than controls [30]. However, other studies have reported that groups of ASD children did not always show a higher prevalence of caries [31,32], and we speculate that the reason for this might be variances in regional scale and differing parental interventions. Another study reported that daily tooth brushing had a positive effect on caries prevention in primary teeth among 6-9-year-old children [33]. As such, affected parents would do well to pay more attention to the condition of primary teeth following primary teeth replacement in 6-9-year-old children.In this study, we also found that PDD (excluding ASD and AS) showed pathogenic effects on childhood caries of permanent teeth. In the past decade, the role of germline de novo mutations (DNMs) of PDD has been established [34,35]. Based on the DNMs, Li J et al. reported a total of 13 unique candidate genes significantly enriched in autistic disorder (CHD8), pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS) (SATB2,CTNNB1,STXBP1,KCNQ2,WDR45,CASK,DDX3X,SMARCA2,RYR2), and Asperger’s syndrome (KDM6B,RRAGC,DNAH17) [36]. TheSATB2is a chromatin remodeling gene located on chromosome 2q33.1, and encodes a protein of 733 amino acids that is able to bind matrix attachment regions to participate in chromatin remodeling and transcriptional regulation [37,38,39]. He L et al. revealed that theSATB2is expressed in odontoblasts, predentin, dental pulp cells and blood vessels in human teeth, suggesting thatSATB2may play an important role in odontoblast differentiation and dentin matrix mineralization during tooth development [40]. We speculated that the causal association of PDD on childhood caries of permanent teeth might be related to the potential molecular mechanism ofSATB2in tooth development. However, the role of PDD and its precise mechanism during childhood caries development requires further research based on other variants such as de novo copy number variations (CNVs), polymorphisms, transmitted variants, homozygous, and compound heterozygous variants.From a public health policy perspective, this study underscores the importance of integrating dental health monitoring into the broader healthcare services for children with developmental disorders, including PDD and ASD [41]. Public health campaigns could focus on raising awareness about the increased caries risk in children with PDD, emphasizing the need for preventive dental measures in early childhood to mitigate the long-term health consequences of untreated caries [24]. Moreover, this study provides crucial evidence to support policies that advocate for more specialized dental care programs for children with developmental disorders [42]. Tailored public health strategies that target both prevention and treatment could significantly reduce the burden of dental diseases in this vulnerable population [43].The association between ASD and permanent teeth caries yielded a P-value of 0.051, which is slightly above the conventional threshold for statistical significance (P< 0.05). This suggests that while a potential causal relationship between ASD and caries in permanent teeth may exist, the evidence is insufficient to confirm such an association definitively. The proximity of the P-value to the significance threshold indicates a possible link that requires further investigation. We acknowledge that this result may be influenced by various factors, such as sample size limitations, potential confounders not fully controlled for, or the inherent complexity of ASD. The methods employed, including inverse-variance weighted (IVW) and weighted median approaches, are robust and control for bias, yet further validation with larger datasets and additional statistical methodologies is warranted to solidify this finding.The present MR study offers several advantages. Based on four large-scale GWAS summary statistics, a total of five methods of MR analyses makes the causal inferences regarding the impact of ASD or PDD (excluding ASD and AS) on childhood caries, accounting for unobserved confounding variables. And the population were of European ancestry to reduce the influence of population stratification. However, this study also has some limitations. One potential limitation of this study is the lack of external validation. The data used in this study were derived from the FinnGen cohort, which represents a population of European ancestry. The generalizability of the findings to other populations, particularly those of non-European descent, remains uncertain. Future studies should validate these results using independent cohorts and external databases to confirm the robustness of the findings. Another limitation is the relatively small sample size for certain Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses. Although the instrumental variables used in this study were strong (all F statistics > 10), the power of some MR analyses could be improved by increasing the sample size. We recommend future studies with larger sample sizes to further examine the causal relationships between ASD/PDD and childhood caries.ConclusionsIn conclusion, our study provides MR evidence supporting a causal role of ASD or PDD (excluding ASD and AS) on childhood caries (primary teeth and permanent teeth) among a population of European ancestry. We hope that this study can improve understanding of ASD or PDD (excluding ASD and AS) and how to influence childhood caries and predict potential risk factors.Data availabilityThe datasets analysed in this study were obtained from FinnGen (Accession Number: finngen_R9_KRA_PSY_AUTISM.
