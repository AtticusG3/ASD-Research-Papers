         medical conditions. In this study, the effectiveness of different MC strains was
         compared depending on the disease to be treated.MethodsThis was an online survey conducted in Germany between June 2020
         and August 2020. Patients were allowed to participate only if they received acannabis-based treatment from pharmacies in the form ofcannabisflowers prescribed by a physician.ResultsThe survey was completed by n=1,028 participants. Most
         participants (58%) have used MC for more than 1 year, on average, 5.9 different
         strains.Bedrocan(pure tetrahydrocannabinol to pure cannabidiol
         [THC:CBD]=22:<1) was the most frequently prescribed strain, followed byBakerstreet(THC:CBD=19:<1) andPedanios 22/1(THC:CBD=22:1). The most frequent conditions MC was prescribed for were
         different pain disorders, psychiatric and neurological diseases, and
         gastrointestinal symptoms. Overall, the mean patient-reported effectiveness was
         80.1% (range, 0–100%). A regression model revealed no association between the
         patient-reported effectiveness and the variety. Furthermore, no influence of the
         disease on the choice of the MC strain was detected. On average, 2.1 side
         effects were reported (most commonly dry mouth (19.5%), increased appetite
         (17.1%), and tiredness (13.0%)). However, 29% of participants did not report any
         side effects. Only 398 participants (38.7%) indicated that costs for MC were
         covered by their health insurance.ConclusionsPatients self-reported very good efficacy and tolerability of
         MC. There was no evidence suggesting that specific MC strains are superior
         depending on the disease to be treated.Keywordsmedicinalcannabis-
