## Abstract

Hoarding disorder remains underexplored and poorly understood despite its significant impact on individuals and communities. While historically linked to obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), emerging evidence suggests they may be distinct conditions. This study aims to investigate these differences.
Adults aged 18-88 years old (M = 39.86, SD = 14.86) were part of the Genomic Psychiatry Cohort study, including 1247 individuals with OCD without presumed hoarding disorder (OCD-pHD) and 663 individuals with OCD and presumed hoarding disorder (OCD+pHD). Sociodemographic data were collected, and participants were screened for other psychiatric conditions. All met DSM-5 criteria for OCD, with severity assessed using the Florida Obsessive-Compulsive Inventory and Y-BOCS. Statistical significance was set at p â‰¤ 0.0007, adjusted for multiple comparisons.
The OCD+pHD group had significantly lower educational attainment, was more likely to live alone or in supervised living, and less likely to be married. This group also had more severe OCD and poorer insight. All types of obsessions and compulsions were more frequent in the OCD+pHD group, except for obsessions related to harming others. Additionally, the OCD+pHD group had higher rates of major depressive disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, body dysmorphic disorder, trichotillomania and previous diagnosis and/or symptoms of attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder. No significant difference was found for substance use and Tic/Tourette disorders.
Significant clinical differences were observed between the groups, highlighting the need for further research to improve diagnosis, conceptualization, awareness, and support for individuals with hoarding disorder in the context of OCD.
