Abstract AbstractBackground:Tourette disorder (TD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by childhood onset of tics lasting more than one year, with multiple motor tics and at least one phonic tic at some point during the course of the symptoms. Treatment of tics may include psychoeducation, non-pharmacologic treatment, or pharmacologic treatment. We review pharmacologic treatment here.Methods:We performed a literature review on pharmacologic treatments for TD.Results:There is no current evidence to suggest that medications impact the prognosis of tic disorders, so current clinical guidelines recommend reassurance of the patient and family and monitoring if there is no change in function or quality of life due to tics. If treatment is indicated, it must be chosen based on the needs of each individual patient. Comprehensive behavioral intervention for tics (CBIT) is considered first-line management for most individuals with bothersome tics, especially if they are mild to moderate in severity. Pharmacotherapy should be considered when tics are impairing daily functioning, causing social problems, accompanied by other neuropsychiatric symptoms, or when the patient is not likely to benefit from CBIT. Current recommended pharmacotherapy options include alpha-2 adrenergic agonists, dopamine modulators, GABAergic medications, dopamine depleters, and botulinum toxin injections. Additionally, there are other novel medications that are being studied in ongoing clinical trials.Conclusions:This review summarizes available pharmacotherapy options for TD in children. It provides an overview of new medications and offers guidance to physicians when selecting appropriate treatments. If medications are indicated for tic management, treatment should be chosen based on the needs of the individual patient.Keywords:Tourette disorder; management; pharmacotherapy; tics; treatment.
