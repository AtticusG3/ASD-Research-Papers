## Abstract

Deletion of the long arm of chromosome 6 (6q deletion syndrome) is a rare chromosomal abnormality that can lead to a variety of neurodevelopmental and physical impairments. Clinical manifestations vary widely depending on the size and location of the deletion, often including developmental delay, hypotonia, and craniofacial dysmorphism.
We present the case of a 2-year-old female with a history of delayed psychomotor development and poor sleep patterns. The patient had been receiving outpatient growth hormone injections prior to presentation. Upon referral to our clinic at age two, comprehensive clinical and laboratory evaluations were performed. Physical examination revealed hypotonia, developmental delay, and subtle craniofacial abnormalities. Chromosomal analysis confirmed a diagnosis of 6q27 deletion syndrome.
Although rare, 6q deletion syndrome should be considered in children presenting with global developmental delay, hypotonia, and atypical facial features. Early diagnosis via karyotyping or chromosomal microarray is critical for appropriate genetic counseling and tailored intervention.
This case underscores the importance of early clinical suspicion and genetic testing in infants with unexplained developmental delays. Prompt diagnosis can guide therapeutic strategies and family support planning.
