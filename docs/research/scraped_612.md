## Abstract
background late preterm infants (34 +0 to 36 +6 weeks’ gestation) account for 7% of births in well-resourced nations. in aotearoa new zealand, māori (indigenous peoples) make up 20% of late preterm births. late preterm infants are at higher risk of adverse outcomes, including mortality, cerebral palsy and cognitive impairment. yet, there has been little focus on prophylactic interventions to address these risks. late preterm infants have more frequent episodes of intermittent hypoxaemia than term infants in the first few postnatal weeks. caffeine citrate, a routine intervention for apnoea of prematurity in extremely preterm infants, improves long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes in very low birth weight infants and reduces the incidence of intermittent hypoxaemia in late preterm infants. the latte trial aims to determine whether prophylactic caffeine citrate given to late preterm infants from birth to term corrected age improves neurodevelopmental outcomes. methods this phase iii multi-centre, parallel two-arm, double-blind, placebo-controlled randomised superiority trial will randomise 478 late preterm infants or twin pairs to receive caffeine citrate (loading dose 40 mg.kg −1 , then 20 mg.kg −1 daily) or placebo until 40 +0 weeks’ postmenstrual age. there is an intentional focus on the recruitment of infants of māori ethnicity to aspire to mana whakamārama (equal explanatory power for the māori population) given their over-representation in late preterm births. randomisation will be stratified by centre, gestation at birth (34, 35 or 36 completed weeks) and ethnicity (māori or non-māori). the primary outcome is the bayley scales of infant development 4th edition cognitive score at 2.5 years’ corrected age. primary analysis will be performed on a modified intention-to-treat basis, comparing outcomes between intervention groups using generalised mixed models with adjustment for stratification, potential confounding by socio-economic status and sex, and non-independence of multiples (random effect). discussion of early developmental domains, cognition is the most predictive of later neurodevelopmental outcome and intelligence quotient. prioritisation of the indigenous population within trials is important. if prophylactic caffeine citrate is found to improve neurodevelopment in late preterm infants, this could have a significant impact on the long-term quality of life and health and wellbeing of this large population of infants. trial registration anzctr actrn12622001344785. registered on 19 october 2022. peer review reports administrative

and have poorer outcomes than their term counterparts. in countries such as the usa, the uk and aotearoa new zealand, 4.3% to 7.7% of infants are born late preterm [ 1 , 2 , 3 ]. in aotearoa new zealand, māori (indigenous peoples) infants make up 20% of the late preterm birth cohort [ 4 ]. compared to term infants, born at 37 +0 weeks’ gestation or later, late preterm infants have higher rates of death, cerebral palsy, developmental delay, cognitive impairment, behavioural disorders and low educational achievement [ 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 ] . in aotearoa new zealand, new zealand european pregnant people have lower rates of preterm delivery and preterm mortality than māori pregnant people [ 3 , 4 ]. the ongoing systemic privilege experienced by non-indigenous pregnant people is seen in other colonised countries such as australia, canada and the usa [ 11 ]. researchers have an obligation to consider health equity and indigenous involvement in all aspects of trial design as part of an intentional approach to improve outcomes for indigenous people [ 12 ]. as part of this process, this trial aims to recruit similar numbers of māori and non-māori infants to aspire to mana whakamārama (equal explanatory power) [ 12 , 13 ]. as part of this approach, guidance was sought and an emphasis placed on whakawhanaungatanga (culturally appropriate approaches and relationship building) throughout the trial, including recruitment and dissemination of results. intermittent hypoxaemia may explain the increased risk of neurodevelopmental impairment apnoeic episodes, or prolonged pauses in breathing, are common in very preterm infants (&lt; 32 weeks’ gestation) and can cause low oxygen saturations, contributing to brain injury, dysmaturation and neurodevelopmental impairment [ 14 ]. late preterm infants are less likely to develop apnoea than more premature infants [ 15 ]. however, in oximetry recordings they still have frequent brief, repetitive decreases in oxygen saturation called intermittent hypoxaemia, which usually continue until term corrected age [ 16 ]. like apnoea, intermittent hypoxaemia is associated with neurodevelopmental impairment in very preterm infants [ 17 ] and may contribute to poorer development in late preterm infants. caffeine may improve outcomes for late preterm infants outcomes in very preterm infants caffeine citrate is used routinely in very preterm infants to treat apnoea of prematurity. caffeine therapy in very low birth weight infants improves the proportion who survive without neurodevelopmental disability at 18 to 21 months [ 18 ]. a recent meta-analysis reported moderate certainty evidence of a reduction in bronchopulmonary dysplasia in neonates treated with caffeine and moderate certainty evidence of a reduction in motor impairment in mid-childhood [ 19 ]. the latte dosage trial the recent latte dosage trial was a phase ii, parallel, multi-arm, double-blinded, randomised placebo-controlled dosage trial, which investigated the effect of different daily doses of enteral caffeine citrate on intermittent hypoxaemia in late preterm infants [ 20 , 21 ]. the trial randomised 132 infants to receive an enteral caffeine citrate loading dose of 10, 20, 30 or 40 mg.kg −1 followed by a maintenance dose of 5, 10, 15 or 20 mg.kg day −1 , or an equal volume of placebo, daily until term postmenstrual age. the primary outcome was the frequency of intermittent hypoxaemia, defined as the average number of events per hour with oxygen saturation concentration ≥ 10% below baseline, measured by overnight oximetry 2 weeks after randomisation. caffeine citrate reduced the frequency of intermittent hypoxaemia, with 20 mg.kg −1 being the most effective dose, with nearly a 70% reduction in the geometric mean intermittent hypoxaemia hourly event rate. caffeine also increased the mean peripheral oxygen saturation (spo 2 ) and reduced the amount of time spent with spo 2 less than 90%. there were no adverse effects of caffeine citrate on growth, feeding or sleep. caffeine increased the mean heart rate, with a significantly higher incidence of tachycardia in all caffeine groups compared to placebo. the latte trial caffeine to improve neurodevelopmental outcomes in infants born late preterm (the latte trial) is a phase iii multi-centre, parallel two-arm, double-blind, placebo-controlled randomised superiority trial of caffeine citrate in late preterm infants to improve the cognitive score at 2.5 years’ corrected age. the latte trial will assess the childhood outcomes of prophylactic enteral caffeine citrate administration in late preterm infants to provide robust evidence of the safety and efficacy of prophylactic caffeine citrate to improve neurodevelopment in late preterm infants. significance prophylactic enteral caffeine citrate is an accessible and economically viable intervention. if successful, this intervention has the potential to impact millions of late preterm infants worldwide [ 22 ]. given the prevalence of late preterm birth for māori, this has the potential to improve health and wellbeing for these infants and their whānau (extended families). though the latte dosage trial demonstrated an improvement in intermittent hypoxaemia and mean oxygen saturation, evidence of long-term neurodevelopmental benefits would provide further evidence for introducing this therapy routinely. objectives {7} to determine if prophylactic enteral caffeine citrate, given to infants born late preterm (34 + 0 to 36 + 6 weeks’ gestation) from birth to term postmenstrual age, improves neurodevelopmental outcome at 2.5 years’ corrected age. trial design {8} in this phase iii multi-centre, parallel two-arm, double-blind, placebo-controlled randomised superiority trial, eligible late preterm infants will be randomised online in a 1:1 ratio, to caffeine citrate or placebo, with stratification for study site groups, gestational age (34, 35 or 36 weeks) and ethnicity (māori or non-māori). methods: participants, interventions and outcomes study setting {9} infants will be recruited at secondary and tertiary maternity hospitals in aotearoa new zealand. they will be randomised and receive the loading dose of the study intervention while in hospital. once the infant is discharged home, the parents/caregivers will continue to give a daily dose of the study intervention until 40 +0 weeks postmenstrual age. at the time of submission for publication, the participating sites are: ◦ whangārei hospital ◦ north shore hospital ◦ waitakere hospital ◦ auckland city hospital ◦ kidz first hospital ◦ waikato hospital ◦ tauranga hospital ◦ whakatāne hospital ◦ rotorua hospital ◦ taranaki base hospital ◦ hawke’s bay hospital ◦ palmerston north regional hospital ◦ dunedin hospital eligibility criteria {10} inclusion criteria: infants born at 34 +0 to 36 +6 weeks’ gestation with no contraindication to caffeine treatment, whose parent/caregiver is able and willing to provide informed consent exclusion criteria: major congenital abnormality minor congenital abnormality likely to affect respiration, growth, or development previous caffeine treatment renal or hepatic impairment tachyarrhythmia seizures hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy maternal age less than 16 years more than 72 h after birth multiple births of triplets or higher who will take informed consent? {26a} parents/caregivers of eligible infants will be approached by a research nurse, research midwife, investigator, or neonatal clinical staff member in the first 72 h after birth as part of whakawhanaungatanga. parents/caregivers will receive written and verbal information about the trial, and any questions will be answered. parents/caregivers of participating infants will sign the informed consent form, and a copy will be provided to them. parents/caregivers are free to withdraw their infant from the trial at any time. the consent form includes an option to consent for information collected up to the point of withdrawal to continue to be processed. additional consent provisions for collection and use of participant data and biological specimens {26b} heart and mind sub-study the heart and mind sub-study will run concomitantly in selected centres. it has a separate protocol and will be reported separately. this sub-study will investigate cerebral blood flow and oxygenation following administration of the study intervention in up to 90 infants. these infants will undergo additional pulse oximetry, near infra-red spectroscopy, blood pressure and respiratory rate measurement, ultrasound and blood testing at baseline, after the loading dose and on day 5. consent to participate in this sub-study is provided in an optional section on the informed consent form. māori data sovereignty data collaborations with other researchers will only be considered if certain principles are met. these include that rightsholders and stakeholders in the study, especially māori, are consulted and engaged in the use and interpretation of study data; the use of study data upholds and is respectful of māori knowledge, worldviews and self-determination; patients are likely to derive benefit from the use of study data, including promotion of equitable outcomes; communities are not stigmatized or portrayed in terms of deficits, and a strengths-based lens is applied; and that the use of study data aligns with aotearoa new zealand ethical and māori data sovereignty frameworks and standards [ 12 , 23 , 24 ]. this process will be overseen collectively by the māori members of the trial steering committee. all participants are informed of the māori data sovereignty policy in the participant information sheet and are given the choice to consent for anonymised study data to be shared with approved researchers on the informed consent form. if this consent is not provided, data for these participants will not be shared with external researchers. interventions explanation for the choice of comparators {6b} the control intervention will be a placebo. at present, no prophylactic intervention is used routinely in late preterm infants to reduce intermittent hypoxemia or improve neurodevelopmental outcomes [ 16 ], so a placebo was considered appropriate. the placebo is the suspension vehicle used for the caffeine intervention, thus ensuring that the interventions have an identical appearance. the placebo will be given at an equivalent volume to the active intervention to preserve blinding. intervention description {11a} in the latte dosage trial, enteral caffeine citrate had a statistically significant effect, compared with placebo, on reducing the frequency of intermittent hypoxaemia at daily maintenance doses of 10 mg.kg −1 and 20 mg.kg −1 , but not at 15 mg.kg −1 [ 20 ]. the latte dosage trial recommended that future trials should consider using a 20 mg.kg −1 dose of caffeine citrate in late preterm infants due to a larger effect size in all respiratory measures and similar drug tolerability for the 20 mg.kg −1 dose compared to 10 mg.kg −1 . based on the findings of this study, a 40 mg.kg −1 loading dose followed by 20 mg.kg –1 day −1 maintenance until 40 +0 weeks’ postmenstrual age was chosen as the active intervention for the current trial. the latte dosage trial reported that when caffeine citrate was formulated in water, it was bitter at higher concentrations and difficult to administer orally in some late preterm infants [ 20 ]. therefore, for the current trial, the active intervention was formulated in a paediatric suspension vehicle, which contains sucrose and cherry flavouring (biomed ltd, auckland, aotearoa new zealand). the concentration of the active intervention is caffeine citrate 20 mg.ml −1 . infants will be given a 2 ml.kg −1 enteral loading dose of the study intervention (40 mg.kg −1 of caffeine citrate in the active intervention). the loading dose will be given prior to the infant reaching 96 h of age, followed by a daily dose of 1 ml.kg −1 each morning (20 mg.kg −1 of caffeine citrate in the active intervention) until 40 +0 weeks’ postmenstrual age. the dose will be recalculated at 3 weeks after randomisation for weight gain. two bottles of the study intervention from the same allocated group will be allocated at randomisation. the first bottle will be used for the first 3 weeks, and then returned to the study centre to determine compliance. the second bottle will be used after the first 3 weeks. the study intervention is given via a nasogastric tube for infants with a tube in situ, and orally for infants who do not require a nasogastric tube. infants who are not able to tolerate enteral medications will have the study intervention withheld until tolerance improves. criteria for discontinuing or modifying allocated interventions {11b} the dose of the study intervention may be reduced from 1 ml.kg −1 .day −1 (20 mg.kg −1 .day −1 caffeine citrate in the active intervention) to 0.5 ml.kg −1 .day −1 (10 mg.kg −1 .day −1 caffeine citrate in the active intervention) if the infant has tachycardia (heart rate consistently &gt; 180 beats per minute at rest) or if the parents/caregivers or clinicians believe the infant has side effects (at the discretion of the site lead investigator). if the parents/caregivers report difficulty administering the full volume, this can be administered as two half doses in the morning, e.g. with two separate feeds. the allocated intervention can be stopped at any time at the request of the parents/caregivers, or by the clinician caring for the infant if they believe that stopping the intervention would be in the best interest of the infant. if the intervention is stopped due to an acute illness or problem that resolves, consideration will be given to restarting the allocated intervention. infants should continue in the study and complete all planned assessments, regardless of adherence to the intervention, unless they are formally withdrawn from the study. outcome data collected up to the point of withdrawal will be reported (with consent). strategies to improve adherence to interventions {11c} where infants remain as inpatients, the study intervention will be charted on the inpatient medication chart to ensure it is given daily by, or under the supervision of, nursing or midwifery staff. the study team will ensure that the parents/caregivers feel comfortable administering the study intervention prior to discharge home. parents/caregivers will have the study team’s contact details to communicate any questions or concerns at any time after discharge home. the first bottle of study intervention will be collected at 3 weeks post randomisation (by courier if the infant has been discharged home), and the amount of study intervention remaining in the bottle will be determined. compliance will be defined as ≥ 80% of the predicted volume of the intervention dispensed. the study team will call the parents/caregivers at 3 weeks post randomisation to arrange the return of the first study bottle, weight-adjust the dose, and provide a reminder to continue the study intervention. they will then call at 40 +0 weeks’ postmenstrual age to remind parents/caregivers to cease the study intervention. relevant concomitant care permitted or prohibited during the trial {11d} all clinical care, other than study interventions and assessments, will be determined by the local clinical team, according to local guidelines. clinicians will be encouraged to use oxygen as first-line treatment for persistent hypoxaemia and positive pressure ventilation for apnoea or intermittent hypoxaemia. if necessary, clinicians can give a loading dose of caffeine citrate as an open-label medication. if a clinician decides to continue open-label caffeine treatment, the latte trial study intervention will be withheld until the open-label caffeine has been stopped. use of open-label caffeine treatment will be recorded. the trial analysis will be according to the allocated intervention group, regardless of any use of open-label caffeine. provisions for post-trial care {30} at the conclusion of early childhood follow up, parents/caregivers of children who have taken part in the study will be sent a letter summarising the results of the assessments, with information about who to contact if they have any questions. if there are concerns about a child’s health or developmental status, referral to an appropriate health agency, usually the child’s primary health provider, will be made with the consent of the parents/caregivers. parents, caregivers, and their health professionals will have the opportunity to request a more detailed report of specific assessment results if required. outcomes {12} primary outcome: mean bayley scales of infant development 4th edition (bsid iv) cognitive standard score at 2.5 years’ corrected age. main secondary outcomes: the following secondary outcomes at 2.5 years’ corrected age are considered critical in evaluating the study hypothesis: 1. cognitive delay (proportion with bsid iv cognitive standard score more than one standard deviation (sd) below the test mean, &lt; 85) 2. mean bsid iv language standard score 3. language delay (proportion with bsid iv language standard score more than one sd below the test mean, &lt; 85) 4. mean bsid iv motor standard score 5. motor delay (proportion with bsid iv motor standard score more than one sd below the mean, &lt; 85) 6. social-emotional/behavioural delay (proportion with bsid iv social-emotional score or bsid iv adaptive behaviour score more than one sd below the mean, &lt; 85) additional secondary outcomes: the following additional secondary outcomes will be reported to complement the evaluation of the active intervention: safety 1. proportion of participants who have died before 2.5 years’ corrected age 2. proportion of participants for whom the study intervention dose was reduced or discontinued due to side effects or poor tolerance of the intervention 3. proportion of participants who had tachycardia requiring dose reduction during the intervention period neonatal 4. mean weight, and weight z-score at 40 +0 weeks’ postmenstrual age 5. mean length of stay in hospital during the primary neonatal admission 6. proportion of participants fully breastfeeding at 40 +0 weeks’ postmenstrual age (the infant has taken breast milk only, no other liquids or solids except a minimal amount of water or prescribed medicines, in the past 48 h) early childhood outcomes at 2.5 years’ corrected age 7. moderate-severe cognitive delay (proportion with bsid iv cognitive standard score more than two sd below the test mean, &lt; 70). 8. moderate-severe language delay (proportion with bsid iv language standard score more than two sd below the test mean, &lt; 70). 9. moderate-severe motor delay (proportion with bsid iv motor standard score more than two sd below the test mean, &lt; 70). 10. developmental delay (proportion with bsid iv cognitive, language or motor standard score more than one sd below the test mean, &lt; 85). 11. high risk of school-age asthma (proportion with predicating asthma risk in childhood (parc) score ≥ 5) [ 25 ]. 12. asthma/wheeze (proportion with wheeze or whistling in the chest in the past 12 months or doctor diagnosed asthma (yes to parc #1/international study of asthma and allergy in childhood (isaac,[ 26 ]) #3 or isaac #7–8 questions)). 13. anthropometry (mean weight, height, head circumference and body mass index z -scores). 14. mean infant and toddler quality of life score (itqol). 15. healthcare utilisation after primary hospital discharge (linkage to routine data from the aotearoa new zealand ministry of health manatū hauora for emergency department visits, outpatient visits and hospitalisations, and parent questions on visits to primary healthcare providers). healthcare utilisation will be reported separately as a component of the health economic evaluation (see {20b}). participant timeline {13} the participant timeline is shown in fig. 1 . fig. 1 schedule of enrolment, interventions and assessments full size image sample size {14} a recent publication found that late preterm infants have a bsid cognitive score 5.3 points lower than term infants, equivalent to approximately one-third of a sd (sd 15) [ 27 ]. to detect a difference in bsid iv cognitive standard score between caffeine and placebo groups of at least 5 points with 90% power (two-sided α = 0.05) requires 191 infants in each arm (total 382). allowing for a conservative 20% drop-out rate (withdrawal and loss to follow-up), we will recruit a total of 478 infants (239 in each arm). infants from a multiple pregnancy may be recruited and will be allocated to the same intervention to avoid accidental cross-over. only one infant from a multiple pregnancy will be counted in the sample size, but all enrolled infants will be included in the modified intention-to-treat analysis. assuming a similar proportion of multiple births to that seen in the latte dosage trial ([ 20 ] ; the average number of infants per mother = 1.065), we expect to include a total of 510 infants if we achieve our target sample size of 478. we will place an emphasis on recruiting māori whānau in this study to assist mana whakamārama (equal explanatory power) to occur. to incorporate this principle, we will aim to recruit equal numbers of māori and non-māori infants. recruitment {15} late preterm infants make up at least 4.3% of births in aotearoa new zealand, or approximately 3000 cases annually [ 3 , 4 ]. the inclusion and exclusion criteria mean that most late preterm infants born at trial sites would be eligible for the latte trial. at time of publication, the five largest tertiary hospital birthing centres in aotearoa new zealand had commenced recruitment [ 4 ]. given that māori make up to 20% of the preterm population, strategies to enhance māori recruitment and retention include an intentional focus on whakawhanaungatanga with parents/caregivers approached by a research nurse/midwife, investigator or māori advisor antenatally or in the early postnatal period to discuss the trial; involvement of whānau and offering of kai (food) and koha (gift or contribution) at trial entry and follow-up visits where appropriate [ 28 ]. assignment of interventions: allocation sequence generation {16a} the allocation sequence will be generated by the study statistician, with stratification for centre (auckland city hospital, kidz first hospital, waikato hospital, dunedin hospital, north island special care baby units and south island special care baby units), gestational length (34, 35 or 36 weeks’ completed gestation) and ethnicity (māori or non-māori). infants from a multiple pregnancy will be allocated to the same study intervention due to the risk of intervention cross-over. concealment mechanism {16b} infants will be assigned randomly via an internet randomisation service to the placebo or caffeine citrate intervention with equal allocation ratio (1:1) according to the generated allocation sequence. only the study statistician, data manager and compounding pharmacy team will have access to the allocation sequence during the trial. personnel with access to the allocation sequence will not be involved in the recruitment of participants, provision of the intervention or outcome assessment. implementation {16c} study personnel or neonatal clinical staff will enrol participants and perform randomisation. at randomisation, the infant will be assigned a unique study identification number and will be allocated a study intervention pack labelled with a random number. the intervention pack will contain two bottles of the appropriate intervention, identified only by the intervention pack random number. only the data manager and compounding pharmacy team will know whether the intervention pack contains the active or control intervention. the infant’s hospital sticker will be applied to the bottles, and the intervention will only be dispensed to that infant. assignment of interventions: blinding who will be blinded {17a} the research team (investigators, coordinator, students, research staff), clinical staff and the infant’s parents/caregivers will be blinded to intervention allocation. this will be achieved by dispensing the intervention in identical bottles containing identical appearing solutions (caffeine and placebo) and labelled with a random number. only the data manager, study statistician and the compounding pharmacy team will have access to the allocation sequence during the trial, and only the data manager and compounding pharmacy team will know the contents of the study bottles. the data manager, study statistician and the compounding pharmacy team will have no direct contact with participants. procedure for unblinding if needed {17b} the clinical team caring for the infant may be unblinded if they consider it necessary for the provision of appropriate clinical care. this decision will be made in conjunction with the site lead investigator. in such an instance, the site lead investigator will contact the data manager and ask them to contact the responsible clinician with the study allocation. study personnel performing outcome assessments will remain blinded at all times. data collection and management plans for assessment and collection of outcomes {18a} the following baseline demographic and contact data will be collected at enrolment from parents/caregivers or the infant’s medical record: infant sex infant ethnicity, including hapū and iwi for māori participants (self-reported by parents/caregivers) [ 29 ] estimated date of birth (for calculating corrected age) infant date of birth birthweight customised birthweight centile [ 30 ] birth length birth head circumference maternal height and weight maternal age and parity pregnancy complications: gestational diabetes, pregestational diabetes, pre-eclampsia, antenatally diagnosed foetal growth restriction, smoking and drug use in pregnancy, antenatal corticosteroid administration, preterm prelabour rupture of membranes, induction of labour, mode of birth, place of birth, 5-min apgar score current respiratory support contact information, including social media, for the parents/caregivers, another close friend or relative, and primary care practitioner. the following data will be collected in the neonatal phase from parents/caregivers, the infant’s medical record or measurements conducted by study personnel: secondary outcomes listed in {12} date and time of loading dose administration neonatal care before and after randomisation: admission to neonatal or special baby care and reason for admission, respiratory support type and duration, apnoea, hypoglycaemia and severity, bacterial infection, date and time of admission and discharge from neonatal or special baby care heart/pulse rate at 1 week (3–8 days) post-randomisation or pre-discharge (whichever occurs first, but at least 72 h after randomisation) date of primary hospital discharge to calculate length of hospital stay for primary neonatal admission concurrent medications taken while the infant is receiving the study intervention weight at 3 weeks post-randomisation to calculate dose adjustment weight of returned bottle of study intervention to calculate compliance the following data will be collected in the early childhood phase from parents/caregivers or assessments conducted by study personnel: primary and secondary outcomes listed in {12} the following safety data will be collected from parents/caregivers, the infant’s medical record or measurements conducted by study personnel: death before 2.5 years’ corrected age (serious adverse event) tachycardia requiring dose reduction during the intervention period study intervention dose reduced or discontinued due to side effects or poor tolerance of the intervention any other adverse event that is considered serious (defined as immediately life-threatening; requires substantial prolongation of existing hospitalisation or escalation in care, or results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity) the following derived variables will be calculated at analysis: socioeconomic decile will be determined from the new zealand deprivation index [ 31 ], calculated from the mother’s address at trial entry gestation and sex-specific z -scores for weight, length and head circumference at birth, and weight z -score at term equivalent age will be calculated using the fenton population reference [ 32 ] age and sex-specific z -scores at 2.5 years’ corrected age for weight, length, bmi, and head circumference will be calculated using the who child growth standards [ 33 ] customised birthweight centiles will be converted to z -scores under the normal distribution baseline demographic, contact data and neonatal data will be recorded by study personnel who have been trained in the use of the study data management systems and data dictionary. early-childhood outcome assessment and recording of data will be conducted by assessors who will be trained in administering and scoring the bsid iv and performing anthropometry for the 2.5-year assessments. all bsid scoring will be performed using an electronic calculator based on age from the estimated date of birth (best obstetric estimate). early-childhood outcome assessors will be trained in the use of the study data management systems and data dictionary. parent questionnaires will be administered online around the time of the early-childhood assessment using the redcap system survey function. hard copy questionnaires will be available if internet access is not available. if questionnaires are completed on paper, the data will be entered into the redcap system by study personnel as soon as possible. support will be offered to parents/caregivers where questionnaires are not in their first language or when lower literacy may make completion of questionnaires difficult. the bsid iv is a structured assessment of cognitive, language and motor development for children up to 42 months. it is performed by a trained assessor, plus scales assessing social-emotional and adaptive behaviour, administered via caregiver questionnaire. it provides norm-referenced scores standardised in the australian and new zealand population. normative standard scores for the bsid iv cognitive, language and motor domains have a mean of 100 and a sd of 15. if a child is unable to complete testing in a domain due to disability or impairment, a score of 2 sd below the mean will be assigned. bsid iv scores are consistent with the bayley-iii, wechsler preschool and primary scale of intelligence and the peabody developmental motor scales [ 34 ]. cognitive scores at 2.5 years’ corrected age have a moderate to high positive correlation with later intelligence quotient, and, of all early developmental domains, cognitive scores are the most predictive of later neurodevelopmental outcomes [ 35 , 36 , 37 ]. the bayley adaptive behaviour and social-emotional scales are parent questionnaires, based on the vineland adaptive behaviour scales third edition and the greenspan social-emotional scales questionnaire for infants and young children, respectively [ 38 ]. at 18–24 months, bsid scale scores are correlated with intelligence and behaviour at school age [ 39 ]. the parc is a 10-item questionnaire focussing on wheezing and related symptoms and risk factors that has been validated for predicting childhood asthma [ 40 ]. the itqol short form assesses parent-reported general health and health-related quality of life based on 47 items that are combined into a transformed scale from 0 (worst health) to 100 (best health) and has been reported to be a reliable and valid alternative to the 97-item itqol [ 41 ]. plans to promote participant retention and complete follow-up {18b} infants will continue in the study and complete all planned assessments, regardless of adherence to the intervention, unless they are formally withdrawn from the study. if the study intervention is ceased temporarily, such as during an acute illness or problem that resolves, consideration will be given to restarting the study intervention. we will contact infants’ parents/caregivers with yearly birthday cards, which include a reminder to update changing contact details. we will trace families for whom current contact information is not available via their primary health provider, midwife or other family members. the trial’s focus on whakawhanaungatanga with parents/caregivers will support retention and tracing. all infants born in aotearoa new zealand are allocated a national health index (nhi) number at birth (national medical record number, mrn). they are entered into a national nhi database, which records contact information and is updated at each contact with secondary or tertiary care. the nhi will be recorded and can be used for tracing participants, if required. a koha will be given to participants at enrolment and 2.5-year follow-up. data management {19} data will be collected directly into ecrfs or electronic surveys using the redcap system. branching logic and range checks will be used to reduce data entry errors. hard copy forms will be available if internet access is not available, and data will be transferred to the redcap system as soon as possible. a data monitor will review each ecrf and survey for completeness before locking forms. if needed, queries will be raised with the site research team and tracked in redcap. a data management plan has been developed to complement the trial protocol, which is available upon request. confidentiality {27} the redcap system will run on amazon web services web and database cloud servers located in sydney, australia, with configuration and security operated by the medical research institute of new zealand. the trial steering group acknowledges that hosting indigenous data on aotearoa new zealand servers would be preferable; however, an appropriate service was not identified prior to trial commencement. web access will be controlled by unique user identification and password, two-factor authentication and user-level privileges, with a full electronic audit trail. participant privacy will be enhanced by the use of three separate redcap projects. project one will store screening data, including infant and maternal nhi/mrn and date of birth (to calculate chronological age); expected date of delivery (to calculate gestation length); infant birthweight, sex and ethnicity; and eligibility criteria. this will enable the reporting of consort data and assessment of external validity. records in project one will be labelled with a unique screening number to allow anonymisation of screening data for non-randomised infants at the completion of the study. project one will also support electronic consent (if eligible); randomisation (if eligible and consented); generate a unique study identification number at randomisation; and allocate intervention packs. following randomisation, records will be created automatically in projects two and three. project two will store baseline data, primary and secondary outcomes, safety data, survey data and sub-study data. records in project two will be identified only by the study identification number. project two will contain no identifiable data other than dates that are essential for calculations. project three will store contact information and identifiable data. records in project three will be identified by the unique study number and will contain nhi/mrn. data access groups will be employed so that site personnel can only see data for participants at their site. the download of data will be restricted to the data manager, study coordinator, principal investigator and study statistician, and only the data manager and principal investigator will be able to download identifiers. extracted data files will contain the indirect identifiers date of birth and estimated date of delivery, as these are necessary for analysis. no direct identifiers such as nhi/mrn, name, or address will be combined with study outcome data. study reports will contain only summary data, and individual participant data will not be reported. identifiers will not be released to any third party. research staff will be certified in best practice for clinical trials. at the completion of the study, deidentified study data will be permanently digitally archived with the university of auckland research data storage services in aotearoa new zealand. a digital reidentification key will be stored separate from the study data and will be accessible only to the senior investigators and head of department, or their representatives. plans for collection, laboratory evaluation and storage of biological specimens for genetic or molecular analysis in this trial/future use {33} blood gas samples for the heart and mind sub-study will be processed immediately. no biological samples will be stored for future analysis or use. statistical methods statistical methods for primary and secondary outcomes {20a} a detailed statistical analysis plan will be finalised and will be made publicly available prior to database lock. the primary analysis will compare primary and secondary outcomes between the placebo and caffeine groups using generalised mixed models with adjustment for the variables used in stratification (centre, gestational age at birth (continuous) and ethnicity (māori or non-māori)); potential confounding by socio-economic status (new zealand deprivation index) and infant sex; and non-independence of multiples (random effect). intervention effects will be presented as mean difference, ratio of geometric means (positively skewed data) or risk difference with 95% confidence interval. for categorical data, an estimate of relative effect will also be given (odds ratio, 95% confidence interval). a hypothesis test will be conducted for the primary outcome (two-tailed α = 0.05). missing data will not be imputed in the primary analysis. the primary analysis will use a modified intention-to-treat approach, which will exclude infants who are (i) randomised in error, i.e. are ineligible; or (ii) withdrawn by parents/caregivers prior to the collection of any outcome data. randomisation errors are expected to be uncommon due to the use of electronic screening and consenting procedures that are linked to the randomisation system. infants will be included in the primary analysis regardless of adherence to the intervention. a complete-case analysis approach will be used in the primary analysis. co-variates for primary analysis are collected at trial entry and missing data are expected to be rare. interim analyses {21b} there is no planned interim efficacy analysis, as it is anticipated that most of the trial sample will have been recruited prior to assessment of the primary outcome at 2.5 years’ corrected age. the data monitoring committee will review safety outcomes annually by masked intervention group. these include death before 2.5 years’ corrected age; tachycardia requiring dose reduction during the intervention period; study intervention dose reduction or discontinuation due to side effects or poor tolerance of the intervention; and other adverse events that are considered serious. based on safety data, the data monitoring committee will advise the trial steering committee if any amendments to the protocol or study procedures should be considered. methods for additional analyses (e.g. subgroup analyses) {20b} secondary analyses will be performed for the primary and critical secondary outcomes, including: 1. sensitivity analysis: compliance: excluding infants who were non-compliant with the study intervention (&lt; 80% of expected volume removed from the first bottle returned at 3 weeks post-randomisation) open label caffeine treatment: excluding infants who received open label caffeine neurological conditions: excluding participants with developmental delay due to conditions unrelated to preterm birth and caffeine therapy, e.g. traumatic brain injury, genetic disorders, and congenital brain malformations 2. imputation analysis: multiple imputation techniques may be considered if there are concerns about bias in effect estimates due to differential loss to follow-up among groups, especially if this is related to prognostic factors 3. subgroup analysis: ethnicity (māori, non-māori) sex (female, male) 4. economic evaluation (to be considered if caffeine citrate is effective at improving outcomes): cost of the caffeine citrate intervention : this will be estimated by quantifying the additional cost associated with consumables required for neonatal intervention (i.e. the total amount of caffeine citrate used) using a resource-based approach. health care service utilisation costs: a self-reported service use questionnaire will be used at follow-up to document health utilisation and costs (e.g. number of hospital days a patient was on a specific mode of respiratory support; emergency department, primary healthcare and therapy visit costs, other health service utilisation costs and surgical procedures; hospital admissions after the initial discharge; and the use of home oxygen) among participants. self-reported service use will be supplemented by electronic administrative data (i.e. the national minimum data set for hospital admissions) obtained with consent. this will use a resource-based costing approach that measures the inputs required to deliver a service (e.g. identify provision of care/number of visits) and applying market prices to each of these resources (e.g. cost/hour for healthcare visit). unit costs will be sourced from published aotearoa new zealand data (where available), and where they are unavailable, published international data (once its applicability to aotearoa new zealand’s context is thoroughly assessed) or local estimates. costs will be measured in current aotearoa new zealand dollars. economic and cost-effectiveness analysis: from a healthcare funder perspective, cost analysis will include direct healthcare costs (i.e. healthcare services, prescription charges), indirect costs (e.g. loss of caregiver productivity, caregiver missed days of work), and out-of-pocket expenses associated with the intervention. a cost-effectiveness analysis will be conducted under the consolidated health economic evaluation reporting guidelines [ 42 ] to examine caffeine citrate treatment’s likely impact on improving neurodevelopmental outcomes in the aotearoa new zealand context. an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio will be calculated to compare additional costs and health benefits associated with the caffeine citrate compared with control as a cost per survivor without neurodevelopment impairment (as measured by bsid iv) [ 43 ]. methods in analysis to handle protocol non-adherence and any statistical methods to handle missing data {20c} the primary analysis will be based on a modified intention-to-treat approach, as defined above {20a}. the analysis data set for the main report will include all participants with at least one primary or secondary outcome. if participants meet the modified intention-to-treat criteria but do not have any outcome data, their baseline characteristics will be described. multiple imputation methods may be considered in secondary analysis to address missing data. plans to give access to the full protocol, participant-level data and statistical code {31c} information regarding the trial is available to the public on the australian new zealand clinical trials registry https://www.anzctr.org.au/trial/registration/trialreview.aspx?id=384799&amp;isreview=true . statistical code and deidentified participant level data of consenting participants will be available after publication, on application, where the purpose meets aotearoa new zealand ethical standards and the trial’s māori data sovereignty policy as detailed in {26b}. oversight and monitoring composition of the coordinating centre and trial steering committee {5d} each trial site has a site lead investigator (usually a neonatal or general paediatrician) to provide day-to-day guidance and liaise with the trial steering committee. the trial steering committee, chaired by the principal investigator (jane alsweiler) is comprised of neonatologists and a respiratory paediatrician experienced in running large, randomised trials; māori academics; a statistician; and a paediatric pharmacist. they meet approximately quarterly or more often as required to discuss operational issues such as recruitment, compliance and adverse effects. the trial steering committee will be responsible for overseeing the publication of trial results in an accurate and timely manner at the conclusion of trial follow-up. composition of the data monitoring committee, its role and reporting structure {21a} the data monitoring committee has four independent members, including the chair, a paediatrician experienced in large, randomised trials; a neonatologist; a statistician; and a māori respiratory paediatrician. the data monitoring committee convened prior to the first randomisation to review the trial protocol and the terms of reference. the data monitoring committee is advisory to the trial steering committee, providing feedback to the principal investigator regarding any recommendations or concerns. the data monitoring committee will monitor recruitment, sample size assumptions, completeness of data acquisition, and evidence for group differences in the safety outcome measures. the data monitoring committee will convene yearly to advise the trial steering committee on trial continuation or protocol modification. once the intervention phase has finished, the data monitoring committee will remain an advisory body until publication. serious adverse events (death before 2.5 years corrected age or other as defined in {18a}) will be reported to the data monitoring committee within 48 h by the site primary investigator; adverse events will be reported at yearly intervals. data monitoring committee: ◦ professor stuart dalziel (chair) auckland, aotearoa new zealand ◦ associate professor kathryn beardsall (independent expert) cambridge, united kingdom ◦ associate professor greg gamble (independent statistician) auckland, aotearoa new zealand ◦ associate professor catherine a. byrnes (ngāti raukawa-ki-te-tonga; independent expert) auckland, aotearoa new zealand adverse event reporting and harms {22} the following serious adverse events and adverse events will be reported to the data monitoring committee: serious adverse events (reported spontaneously to the data monitoring committee within 48 h of the site primary investigator being notified): death before 2.5 years’ corrected age other serious adverse event (defined as immediately life-threatening; requires prolongation of existing hospitalisation or substantial escalation in care, or results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity) adverse events (systematically recorded in ecrfs and reported to the data monitoring committee annually): tachycardia requiring dose reduction during the intervention period study intervention dose reduced or discontinued due to side effects or poor tolerance of the intervention death before 2.5 years’ corrected age, tachycardia requiring dose reduction during the intervention period, and study intervention dose reduced or discontinued due to side effects or poor tolerance of the intervention are specified secondary outcomes recorded systematically for all participants and will be reported in the trial publication. if deemed trial related by the dmc, other serious adverse events will be reported in the trial publication using the neonatal adverse event severity scale framework [ 44 ]. frequency and plans for auditing trial conduct {23} data entry will be continuously audited for accuracy and completeness. protocol deviations, adverse effects, and recruitment will be audited periodically at the regular trial steering committee meetings. plans for communicating important protocol amendments to relevant parties (e.g. trial participants, ethical committees) {25} there have not been any major changes to the trial protocol since the trial began. minor changes and additions sought by the trial steering committee will be submitted for approval to relevant ethics committees, and then distributed and communicated to each participating site. dissemination plans {31a} results will be communicated to those parents/caregivers who requested to receive a trial report on the consent form. this will be sent via email and using lay language. results will also be disseminated back to māori communities. the results of the trial will be presented at national and international conferences and will be published in high-impact medical journals. media and social media opportunities will be sought to communicate the results to the public. discussion enteral caffeine citrate is a simple intervention that may improve developmental outcomes in the large cohort of infants born late preterm. the latte trial is a phase iii multi-centre, parallel two-arm, double-blind, placebo-controlled randomised superiority trial, which is powered to detect important differences in cognitive outcome at 2.5 years’ corrected age, the early developmental domain most predictive of later neurodevelopmental outcome. while it is promising that caffeine citrate reduces intermittent hypoxaemia in late preterm infants, assessment of meaningful longer-term outcomes will provide convincing evidence for the implementation of routine caffeine prophylaxis for all late preterm infants if it proves to be beneficial. this trial has taken an intentional approach to incorporating māori principles in trial design and promoting indigenous recruitment, data governance and data sovereignty, in order to pursue improved outcomes for indigenous peoples. trial status the current protocol is version number 1.3, dated 14/06/2024. recruitment commenced in may 2023 at kidz first hospital, auckland, with additional sites added over time. recruitment is expected to be completed in late 2025, with results available in 2028. data availability {29} applications to obtain study data may be made to the principal investigator and will be at the discretion of the trial steering committee. anonymised individual patient study data may be made available to researchers through a mediated process to ensure that aotearoa new zealand ethical standards and māori data sovereignty framework are upheld, as further detailed in {26b}. model consent forms, ecrf templates and the statistical analysis plan will be available on request. abbreviations spo 2 : peripheral oxygen saturation bsid iv: bayley scales of infant development 4th edition sd: standard deviation parc:

## Introduction
background and rationale {6a} burden of disease late preterm infants, born at 34 +0 to 36 +6 weeks’ gestation, are common and have poorer outcomes than their term counterparts. in countries such as the usa, the uk and aotearoa new zealand, 4.3% to 7.7% of infants are born late preterm [ 1 , 2 , 3 ]. in aotearoa new zealand, māori (indigenous peoples) infants make up 20% of the late preterm birth cohort [ 4 ]. compared to term infants, born at 37 +0 weeks’ gestation or later, late preterm infants have higher rates of death, cerebral palsy, developmental delay, cognitive impairment, behavioural disorders and low educational achievement [ 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 ] . in aotearoa new zealand, new zealand european pregnant people have lower rates of preterm delivery and preterm mortality than māori pregnant people [ 3 , 4 ]. the ongoing systemic privilege experienced by non-indigenous pregnant people is seen in other colonised countries such as australia, canada and the usa [ 11 ]. researchers have an obligation to consider health equity and indigenous involvement in all aspects of trial design as part of an intentional approach to improve outcomes for indigenous people [ 12 ]. as part of this process, this trial aims to recruit similar numbers of māori and non-māori infants to aspire to mana whakamārama (equal explanatory power) [ 12 , 13 ]. as part of this approach, guidance was sought and an emphasis placed on whakawhanaungatanga (culturally appropriate approaches and relationship building) throughout the trial, including recruitment and dissemination of results. intermittent hypoxaemia may explain the increased risk of neurodevelopmental impairment apnoeic episodes, or prolonged pauses in breathing, are common in very preterm infants (&lt; 32 weeks’ gestation) and can cause low oxygen saturations, contributing to brain injury, dysmaturation and neurodevelopmental impairment [ 14 ]. late preterm infants are less likely to develop apnoea than more premature infants [ 15 ]. however, in oximetry recordings they still have frequent brief, repetitive decreases in oxygen saturation called intermittent hypoxaemia, which usually continue until term corrected age [ 16 ]. like apnoea, intermittent hypoxaemia is associated with neurodevelopmental impairment in very preterm infants [ 17 ] and may contribute to poorer development in late preterm infants. caffeine may improve outcomes for late preterm infants outcomes in very preterm infants caffeine citrate is used routinely in very preterm infants to treat apnoea of prematurity. caffeine therapy in very low birth weight infants improves the proportion who survive without neurodevelopmental disability at 18 to 21 months [ 18 ]. a recent meta-analysis reported moderate certainty evidence of a reduction in bronchopulmonary dysplasia in neonates treated with caffeine and moderate certainty evidence of a reduction in motor impairment in mid-childhood [ 19 ]. the latte dosage trial the recent latte dosage trial was a phase ii, parallel, multi-arm, double-blinded, randomised placebo-controlled dosage trial, which investigated the effect of different daily doses of enteral caffeine citrate on intermittent hypoxaemia in late preterm infants [ 20 , 21 ]. the trial randomised 132 infants to receive an enteral caffeine citrate loading dose of 10, 20, 30 or 40 mg.kg −1 followed by a maintenance dose of 5, 10, 15 or 20 mg.kg day −1 , or an equal volume of placebo, daily until term postmenstrual age. the primary outcome was the frequency of intermittent hypoxaemia, defined as the average number of events per hour with oxygen saturation concentration ≥ 10% below baseline, measured by overnight oximetry 2 weeks after randomisation. caffeine citrate reduced the frequency of intermittent hypoxaemia, with 20 mg.kg −1 being the most effective dose, with nearly a 70% reduction in the geometric mean intermittent hypoxaemia hourly event rate. caffeine also increased the mean peripheral oxygen saturation (spo 2 ) and reduced the amount of time spent with spo 2 less than 90%. there were no adverse effects of caffeine citrate on growth, feeding or sleep. caffeine increased the mean heart rate, with a significantly higher incidence of tachycardia in all caffeine groups compared to placebo. the latte trial caffeine to improve neurodevelopmental outcomes in infants born late preterm (the latte trial) is a phase iii multi-centre, parallel two-arm, double-blind, placebo-controlled randomised superiority trial of caffeine citrate in late preterm infants to improve the cognitive score at 2.5 years’ corrected age. the latte trial will assess the childhood outcomes of prophylactic enteral caffeine citrate administration in late preterm infants to provide robust evidence of the safety and efficacy of prophylactic caffeine citrate to improve neurodevelopment in late preterm infants. significance prophylactic enteral caffeine citrate is an accessible and economically viable intervention. if successful, this intervention has the potential to impact millions of late preterm infants worldwide [ 22 ]. given the prevalence of late preterm birth for māori, this has the potential to improve health and wellbeing for these infants and their whānau (extended families). though the latte dosage trial demonstrated an improvement in intermittent hypoxaemia and mean oxygen saturation, evidence of long-term neurodevelopmental benefits would provide further evidence for introducing this therapy routinely. objectives {7} to determine if prophylactic enteral caffeine citrate, given to infants born late preterm (34 + 0 to 36 + 6 weeks’ gestation) from birth to term postmenstrual age, improves neurodevelopmental outcome at 2.5 years’ corrected age. trial design {8} in this phase iii multi-centre, parallel two-arm, double-blind, placebo-controlled randomised superiority trial, eligible late preterm infants will be randomised online in a 1:1 ratio, to caffeine citrate or placebo, with stratification for study site groups, gestational age (34, 35 or 36 weeks) and ethnicity (māori or non-māori). methods: participants, interventions and outcomes study setting {9} infants will be recruited at secondary and tertiary maternity hospitals in aotearoa new zealand. they will be randomised and receive the loading dose of the study intervention while in hospital. once the infant is discharged home, the parents/caregivers will continue to give a daily dose of the study intervention until 40 +0 weeks postmenstrual age. at the time of submission for publication, the participating sites are: ◦ whangārei hospital ◦ north shore hospital ◦ waitakere hospital ◦ auckland city hospital ◦ kidz first hospital ◦ waikato hospital ◦ tauranga hospital ◦ whakatāne hospital ◦ rotorua hospital ◦ taranaki base hospital ◦ hawke’s bay hospital ◦ palmerston north regional hospital ◦ dunedin hospital eligibility criteria {10} inclusion criteria: infants born at 34 +0 to 36 +6 weeks’ gestation with no contraindication to caffeine treatment, whose parent/caregiver is able and willing to provide informed consent exclusion criteria: major congenital abnormality minor congenital abnormality likely to affect respiration, growth, or development previous caffeine treatment renal or hepatic impairment tachyarrhythmia seizures hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy maternal age less than 16 years more than 72 h after birth multiple births of triplets or higher who will take informed consent? {26a} parents/caregivers of eligible infants will be approached by a research nurse, research midwife, investigator, or neonatal clinical staff member in the first 72 h after birth as part of whakawhanaungatanga. parents/caregivers will receive written and verbal information about the trial, and any questions will be answered. parents/caregivers of participating infants will sign the informed consent form, and a copy will be provided to them. parents/caregivers are free to withdraw their infant from the trial at any time. the consent form includes an option to consent for information collected up to the point of withdrawal to continue to be processed. additional consent provisions for collection and use of participant data and biological specimens {26b} heart and mind sub-study the heart and mind sub-study will run concomitantly in selected centres. it has a separate protocol and will be reported separately. this sub-study will investigate cerebral blood flow and oxygenation following administration of the study intervention in up to 90 infants. these infants will undergo additional pulse oximetry, near infra-red spectroscopy, blood pressure and respiratory rate measurement, ultrasound and blood testing at baseline, after the loading dose and on day 5. consent to participate in this sub-study is provided in an optional section on the informed consent form. māori data sovereignty data collaborations with other researchers will only be considered if certain principles are met. these include that rightsholders and stakeholders in the study, especially māori, are consulted and engaged in the use and interpretation of study data; the use of study data upholds and is respectful of māori knowledge, worldviews and self-determination; patients are likely to derive benefit from the use of study data, including promotion of equitable outcomes; communities are not stigmatized or portrayed in terms of deficits, and a strengths-based lens is applied; and that the use of study data aligns with aotearoa new zealand ethical and māori data sovereignty frameworks and standards [ 12 , 23 , 24 ]. this process will be overseen collectively by the māori members of the trial steering committee. all participants are informed of the māori data sovereignty policy in the participant information sheet and are given the choice to consent for anonymised study data to be shared with approved researchers on the informed consent form. if this consent is not provided, data for these participants will not be shared with external researchers. interventions explanation for the choice of comparators {6b} the control intervention will be a placebo. at present, no prophylactic intervention is used routinely in late preterm infants to reduce intermittent hypoxemia or improve neurodevelopmental outcomes [ 16 ], so a placebo was considered appropriate. the placebo is the suspension vehicle used for the caffeine intervention, thus ensuring that the interventions have an identical appearance. the placebo will be given at an equivalent volume to the active intervention to preserve blinding. intervention description {11a} in the latte dosage trial, enteral caffeine citrate had a statistically significant effect, compared with placebo, on reducing the frequency of intermittent hypoxaemia at daily maintenance doses of 10 mg.kg −1 and 20 mg.kg −1 , but not at 15 mg.kg −1 [ 20 ]. the latte dosage trial recommended that future trials should consider using a 20 mg.kg −1 dose of caffeine citrate in late preterm infants due to a larger effect size in all respiratory measures and similar drug tolerability for the 20 mg.kg −1 dose compared to 10 mg.kg −1 . based on the findings of this study, a 40 mg.kg −1 loading dose followed by 20 mg.kg –1 day −1 maintenance until 40 +0 weeks’ postmenstrual age was chosen as the active intervention for the current trial. the latte dosage trial reported that when caffeine citrate was formulated in water, it was bitter at higher concentrations and difficult to administer orally in some late preterm infants [ 20 ]. therefore, for the current trial, the active intervention was formulated in a paediatric suspension vehicle, which contains sucrose and cherry flavouring (biomed ltd, auckland, aotearoa new zealand). the concentration of the active intervention is caffeine citrate 20 mg.ml −1 . infants will be given a 2 ml.kg −1 enteral loading dose of the study intervention (40 mg.kg −1 of caffeine citrate in the active intervention). the loading dose will be given prior to the infant reaching 96 h of age, followed by a daily dose of 1 ml.kg −1 each morning (20 mg.kg −1 of caffeine citrate in the active intervention) until 40 +0 weeks’ postmenstrual age. the dose will be recalculated at 3 weeks after randomisation for weight gain. two bottles of the study intervention from the same allocated group will be allocated at randomisation. the first bottle will be used for the first 3 weeks, and then returned to the study centre to determine compliance. the second bottle will be used after the first 3 weeks. the study intervention is given via a nasogastric tube for infants with a tube in situ, and orally for infants who do not require a nasogastric tube. infants who are not able to tolerate enteral medications will have the study intervention withheld until tolerance improves. criteria for discontinuing or modifying allocated interventions {11b} the dose of the study intervention may be reduced from 1 ml.kg −1 .day −1 (20 mg.kg −1 .day −1 caffeine citrate in the active intervention) to 0.5 ml.kg −1 .day −1 (10 mg.kg −1 .day −1 caffeine citrate in the active intervention) if the infant has tachycardia (heart rate consistently &gt; 180 beats per minute at rest) or if the parents/caregivers or clinicians believe the infant has side effects (at the discretion of the site lead investigator). if the parents/caregivers report difficulty administering the full volume, this can be administered as two half doses in the morning, e.g. with two separate feeds. the allocated intervention can be stopped at any time at the request of the parents/caregivers, or by the clinician caring for the infant if they believe that stopping the intervention would be in the best interest of the infant. if the intervention is stopped due to an acute illness or problem that resolves, consideration will be given to restarting the allocated intervention. infants should continue in the study and complete all planned assessments, regardless of adherence to the intervention, unless they are formally withdrawn from the study. outcome data collected up to the point of withdrawal will be reported (with consent). strategies to improve adherence to interventions {11c} where infants remain as inpatients, the study intervention will be charted on the inpatient medication chart to ensure it is given daily by, or under the supervision of, nursing or midwifery staff. the study team will ensure that the parents/caregivers feel comfortable administering the study intervention prior to discharge home. parents/caregivers will have the study team’s contact details to communicate any questions or concerns at any time after discharge home. the first bottle of study intervention will be collected at 3 weeks post randomisation (by courier if the infant has been discharged home), and the amount of study intervention remaining in the bottle will be determined. compliance will be defined as ≥ 80% of the predicted volume of the intervention dispensed. the study team will call the parents/caregivers at 3 weeks post randomisation to arrange the return of the first study bottle, weight-adjust the dose, and provide a reminder to continue the study intervention. they will then call at 40 +0 weeks’ postmenstrual age to remind parents/caregivers to cease the study intervention. relevant concomitant care permitted or prohibited during the trial {11d} all clinical care, other than study interventions and assessments, will be determined by the local clinical team, according to local guidelines. clinicians will be encouraged to use oxygen as first-line treatment for persistent hypoxaemia and positive pressure ventilation for apnoea or intermittent hypoxaemia. if necessary, clinicians can give a loading dose of caffeine citrate as an open-label medication. if a clinician decides to continue open-label caffeine treatment, the latte trial study intervention will be withheld until the open-label caffeine has been stopped. use of open-label caffeine treatment will be recorded. the trial analysis will be according to the allocated intervention group, regardless of any use of open-label caffeine. provisions for post-trial care {30} at the conclusion of early childhood follow up, parents/caregivers of children who have taken part in the study will be sent a letter summarising the results of the assessments, with information about who to contact if they have any questions. if there are concerns about a child’s health or developmental status, referral to an appropriate health agency, usually the child’s primary health provider, will be made with the consent of the parents/caregivers. parents, caregivers, and their health professionals will have the opportunity to request a more detailed report of specific assessment results if required. outcomes {12} primary outcome: mean bayley scales of infant development 4th edition (bsid iv) cognitive standard score at 2.5 years’ corrected age. main secondary outcomes: the following secondary outcomes at 2.5 years’ corrected age are considered critical in evaluating the study hypothesis: 1. cognitive delay (proportion with bsid iv cognitive standard score more than one standard deviation (sd) below the test mean, &lt; 85) 2. mean bsid iv language standard score 3. language delay (proportion with bsid iv language standard score more than one sd below the test mean, &lt; 85) 4. mean bsid iv motor standard score 5. motor delay (proportion with bsid iv motor standard score more than one sd below the mean, &lt; 85) 6. social-emotional/behavioural delay (proportion with bsid iv social-emotional score or bsid iv adaptive behaviour score more than one sd below the mean, &lt; 85) additional secondary outcomes: the following additional secondary outcomes will be reported to complement the evaluation of the active intervention: safety 1. proportion of participants who have died before 2.5 years’ corrected age 2. proportion of participants for whom the study intervention dose was reduced or discontinued due to side effects or poor tolerance of the intervention 3. proportion of participants who had tachycardia requiring dose reduction during the intervention period neonatal 4. mean weight, and weight z-score at 40 +0 weeks’ postmenstrual age 5. mean length of stay in hospital during the primary neonatal admission 6. proportion of participants fully breastfeeding at 40 +0 weeks’ postmenstrual age (the infant has taken breast milk only, no other liquids or solids except a minimal amount of water or prescribed medicines, in the past 48 h) early childhood outcomes at 2.5 years’ corrected age 7. moderate-severe cognitive delay (proportion with bsid iv cognitive standard score more than two sd below the test mean, &lt; 70). 8. moderate-severe language delay (proportion with bsid iv language standard score more than two sd below the test mean, &lt; 70). 9. moderate-severe motor delay (proportion with bsid iv motor standard score more than two sd below the test mean, &lt; 70). 10. developmental delay (proportion with bsid iv cognitive, language or motor standard score more than one sd below the test mean, &lt; 85). 11. high risk of school-age asthma (proportion with predicating asthma risk in childhood (parc) score ≥ 5) [ 25 ]. 12. asthma/wheeze (proportion with wheeze or whistling in the chest in the past 12 months or doctor diagnosed asthma (yes to parc #1/international study of asthma and allergy in childhood (isaac,[ 26 ]) #3 or isaac #7–8 questions)). 13. anthropometry (mean weight, height, head circumference and body mass index z -scores). 14. mean infant and toddler quality of life score (itqol). 15. healthcare utilisation after primary hospital discharge (linkage to routine data from the aotearoa new zealand ministry of health manatū hauora for emergency department visits, outpatient visits and hospitalisations, and parent questions on visits to primary healthcare providers). healthcare utilisation will be reported separately as a component of the health economic evaluation (see {20b}). participant timeline {13} the participant timeline is shown in fig. 1 . fig. 1 schedule of enrolment, interventions and assessments full size image sample size {14} a recent publication found that late preterm infants have a bsid cognitive score 5.3 points lower than term infants, equivalent to approximately one-third of a sd (sd 15) [ 27 ]. to detect a difference in bsid iv cognitive standard score between caffeine and placebo groups of at least 5 points with 90% power (two-sided α = 0.05) requires 191 infants in each arm (total 382). allowing for a conservative 20% drop-out rate (withdrawal and loss to follow-up), we will recruit a total of 478 infants (239 in each arm). infants from a multiple pregnancy may be recruited and will be allocated to the same intervention to avoid accidental cross-over. only one infant from a multiple pregnancy will be counted in the sample size, but all enrolled infants will be included in the modified intention-to-treat analysis. assuming a similar proportion of multiple births to that seen in the latte dosage trial ([ 20 ] ; the average number of infants per mother = 1.065), we expect to include a total of 510 infants if we achieve our target sample size of 478. we will place an emphasis on recruiting māori whānau in this study to assist mana whakamārama (equal explanatory power) to occur. to incorporate this principle, we will aim to recruit equal numbers of māori and non-māori infants. recruitment {15} late preterm infants make up at least 4.3% of births in aotearoa new zealand, or approximately 3000 cases annually [ 3 , 4 ]. the inclusion and exclusion criteria mean that most late preterm infants born at trial sites would be eligible for the latte trial. at time of publication, the five largest tertiary hospital birthing centres in aotearoa new zealand had commenced recruitment [ 4 ]. given that māori make up to 20% of the preterm population, strategies to enhance māori recruitment and retention include an intentional focus on whakawhanaungatanga with parents/caregivers approached by a research nurse/midwife, investigator or māori advisor antenatally or in the early postnatal period to discuss the trial; involvement of whānau and offering of kai (food) and koha (gift or contribution) at trial entry and follow-up visits where appropriate [ 28 ]. assignment of interventions: allocation sequence generation {16a} the allocation sequence will be generated by the study statistician, with stratification for centre (auckland city hospital, kidz first hospital, waikato hospital, dunedin hospital, north island special care baby units and south island special care baby units), gestational length (34, 35 or 36 weeks’ completed gestation) and ethnicity (māori or non-māori). infants from a multiple pregnancy will be allocated to the same study intervention due to the risk of intervention cross-over. concealment mechanism {16b} infants will be assigned randomly via an internet randomisation service to the placebo or caffeine citrate intervention with equal allocation ratio (1:1) according to the generated allocation sequence. only the study statistician, data manager and compounding pharmacy team will have access to the allocation sequence during the trial. personnel with access to the allocation sequence will not be involved in the recruitment of participants, provision of the intervention or outcome assessment. implementation {16c} study personnel or neonatal clinical staff will enrol participants and perform randomisation. at randomisation, the infant will be assigned a unique study identification number and will be allocated a study intervention pack labelled with a random number. the intervention pack will contain two bottles of the appropriate intervention, identified only by the intervention pack random number. only the data manager and compounding pharmacy team will know whether the intervention pack contains the active or control intervention. the infant’s hospital sticker will be applied to the bottles, and the intervention will only be dispensed to that infant. assignment of interventions: blinding who will be blinded {17a} the research team (investigators, coordinator, students, research staff), clinical staff and the infant’s parents/caregivers will be blinded to intervention allocation. this will be achieved by dispensing the intervention in identical bottles containing identical appearing solutions (caffeine and placebo) and labelled with a random number. only the data manager, study statistician and the compounding pharmacy team will have access to the allocation sequence during the trial, and only the data manager and compounding pharmacy team will know the contents of the study bottles. the data manager, study statistician and the compounding pharmacy team will have no direct contact with participants. procedure for unblinding if needed {17b} the clinical team caring for the infant may be unblinded if they consider it necessary for the provision of appropriate clinical care. this decision will be made in conjunction with the site lead investigator. in such an instance, the site lead investigator will contact the data manager and ask them to contact the responsible clinician with the study allocation. study personnel performing outcome assessments will remain blinded at all times. data collection and management plans for assessment and collection of outcomes {18a} the following baseline demographic and contact data will be collected at enrolment from parents/caregivers or the infant’s medical record: infant sex infant ethnicity, including hapū and iwi for māori participants (self-reported by parents/caregivers) [ 29 ] estimated date of birth (for calculating corrected age) infant date of birth birthweight customised birthweight centile [ 30 ] birth length birth head circumference maternal height and weight maternal age and parity pregnancy complications: gestational diabetes, pregestational diabetes, pre-eclampsia, antenatally diagnosed foetal growth restriction, smoking and drug use in pregnancy, antenatal corticosteroid administration, preterm prelabour rupture of membranes, induction of labour, mode of birth, place of birth, 5-min apgar score current respiratory support contact information, including social media, for the parents/caregivers, another close friend or relative, and primary care practitioner. the following data will be collected in the neonatal phase from parents/caregivers, the infant’s medical record or measurements conducted by study personnel: secondary outcomes listed in {12} date and time of loading dose administration neonatal care before and after randomisation: admission to neonatal or special baby care and reason for admission, respiratory support type and duration, apnoea, hypoglycaemia and severity, bacterial infection, date and time of admission and discharge from neonatal or special baby care heart/pulse rate at 1 week (3–8 days) post-randomisation or pre-discharge (whichever occurs first, but at least 72 h after randomisation) date of primary hospital discharge to calculate length of hospital stay for primary neonatal admission concurrent medications taken while the infant is receiving the study intervention weight at 3 weeks post-randomisation to calculate dose adjustment weight of returned bottle of study intervention to calculate compliance the following data will be collected in the early childhood phase from parents/caregivers or assessments conducted by study personnel: primary and secondary outcomes listed in {12} the following safety data will be collected from parents/caregivers, the infant’s medical record or measurements conducted by study personnel: death before 2.5 years’ corrected age (serious adverse event) tachycardia requiring dose reduction during the intervention period study intervention dose reduced or discontinued due to side effects or poor tolerance of the intervention any other adverse event that is considered serious (defined as immediately life-threatening; requires substantial prolongation of existing hospitalisation or escalation in care, or results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity) the following derived variables will be calculated at analysis: socioeconomic decile will be determined from the new zealand deprivation index [ 31 ], calculated from the mother’s address at trial entry gestation and sex-specific z -scores for weight, length and head circumference at birth, and weight z -score at term equivalent age will be calculated using the fenton population reference [ 32 ] age and sex-specific z -scores at 2.5 years’ corrected age for weight, length, bmi, and head circumference will be calculated using the who child growth standards [ 33 ] customised birthweight centiles will be converted to z -scores under the normal distribution baseline demographic, contact data and neonatal data will be recorded by study personnel who have been trained in the use of the study data management systems and data dictionary. early-childhood outcome assessment and recording of data will be conducted by assessors who will be trained in administering and scoring the bsid iv and performing anthropometry for the 2.5-year assessments. all bsid scoring will be performed using an electronic calculator based on age from the estimated date of birth (best obstetric estimate). early-childhood outcome assessors will be trained in the use of the study data management systems and data dictionary. parent questionnaires will be administered online around the time of the early-childhood assessment using the redcap system survey function. hard copy questionnaires will be available if internet access is not available. if questionnaires are completed on paper, the data will be entered into the redcap system by study personnel as soon as possible. support will be offered to parents/caregivers where questionnaires are not in their first language or when lower literacy may make completion of questionnaires difficult. the bsid iv is a structured assessment of cognitive, language and motor development for children up to 42 months. it is performed by a trained assessor, plus scales assessing social-emotional and adaptive behaviour, administered via caregiver questionnaire. it provides norm-referenced scores standardised in the australian and new zealand population. normative standard scores for the bsid iv cognitive, language and motor domains have a mean of 100 and a sd of 15. if a child is unable to complete testing in a domain due to disability or impairment, a score of 2 sd below the mean will be assigned. bsid iv scores are consistent with the bayley-iii, wechsler preschool and primary scale of intelligence and the peabody developmental motor scales [ 34 ]. cognitive scores at 2.5 years’ corrected age have a moderate to high positive correlation with later intelligence quotient, and, of all early developmental domains, cognitive scores are the most predictive of later neurodevelopmental outcomes [ 35 , 36 , 37 ]. the bayley adaptive behaviour and social-emotional scales are parent questionnaires, based on the vineland adaptive behaviour scales third edition and the greenspan social-emotional scales questionnaire for infants and young children, respectively [ 38 ]. at 18–24 months, bsid scale scores are correlated with intelligence and behaviour at school age [ 39 ]. the parc is a 10-item questionnaire focussing on wheezing and related symptoms and risk factors that has been validated for predicting childhood asthma [ 40 ]. the itqol short form assesses parent-reported general health and health-related quality of life based on 47 items that are combined into a transformed scale from 0 (worst health) to 100 (best health) and has been reported to be a reliable and valid alternative to the 97-item itqol [ 41 ]. plans to promote participant retention and complete follow-up {18b} infants will continue in the study and complete all planned assessments, regardless of adherence to the intervention, unless they are formally withdrawn from the study. if the study intervention is ceased temporarily, such as during an acute illness or problem that resolves, consideration will be given to restarting the study intervention. we will contact infants’ parents/caregivers with yearly birthday cards, which include a reminder to update changing contact details. we will trace families for whom current contact information is not available via their primary health provider, midwife or other family members. the trial’s focus on whakawhanaungatanga with parents/caregivers will support retention and tracing. all infants born in aotearoa new zealand are allocated a national health index (nhi) number at birth (national medical record number, mrn). they are entered into a national nhi database, which records contact information and is updated at each contact with secondary or tertiary care. the nhi will be recorded and can be used for tracing participants, if required. a koha will be given to participants at enrolment and 2.5-year follow-up. data management {19} data will be collected directly into ecrfs or electronic surveys using the redcap system. branching logic and range checks will be used to reduce data entry errors. hard copy forms will be available if internet access is not available, and data will be transferred to the redcap system as soon as possible. a data monitor will review each ecrf and survey for completeness before locking forms. if needed, queries will be raised with the site research team and tracked in redcap. a data management plan has been developed to complement the trial protocol, which is available upon request. confidentiality {27} the redcap system will run on amazon web services web and database cloud servers located in sydney, australia, with configuration and security operated by the medical research institute of new zealand. the trial steering group acknowledges that hosting indigenous data on aotearoa new zealand servers would be preferable; however, an appropriate service was not identified prior to trial commencement. web access will be controlled by unique user identification and password, two-factor authentication and user-level privileges, with a full electronic audit trail. participant privacy will be enhanced by the use of three separate redcap projects. project one will store screening data, including infant and maternal nhi/mrn and date of birth (to calculate chronological age); expected date of delivery (to calculate gestation length); infant birthweight, sex and ethnicity; and eligibility criteria. this will enable the reporting of consort data and assessment of external validity. records in project one will be labelled with a unique screening number to allow anonymisation of screening data for non-randomised infants at the completion of the study. project one will also support electronic consent (if eligible); randomisation (if eligible and consented); generate a unique study identification number at randomisation; and allocate intervention packs. following randomisation, records will be created automatically in projects two and three. project two will store baseline data, primary and secondary outcomes, safety data, survey data and sub-study data. records in project two will be identified only by the study identification number. project two will contain no identifiable data other than dates that are essential for calculations. project three will store contact information and identifiable data. records in project three will be identified by the unique study number and will contain nhi/mrn. data access groups will be employed so that site personnel can only see data for participants at their site. the download of data will be restricted to the data manager, study coordinator, principal investigator and study statistician, and only the data manager and principal investigator will be able to download identifiers. extracted data files will contain the indirect identifiers date of birth and estimated date of delivery, as these are necessary for analysis. no direct identifiers such as nhi/mrn, name, or address will be combined with study outcome data. study reports will contain only summary data, and individual participant data will not be reported. identifiers will not be released to any third party. research staff will be certified in best practice for clinical trials. at the completion of the study, deidentified study data will be permanently digitally archived with the university of auckland research data storage services in aotearoa new zealand. a digital reidentification key will be stored separate from the study data and will be accessible only to the senior investigators and head of department, or their representatives. plans for collection, laboratory evaluation and storage of biological specimens for genetic or molecular analysis in this trial/future use {33} blood gas samples for the heart and mind sub-study will be processed immediately. no biological samples will be stored for future analysis or use. statistical methods statistical methods for primary and secondary outcomes {20a} a detailed statistical analysis plan will be finalised and will be made publicly available prior to database lock. the primary analysis will compare primary and secondary outcomes between the placebo and caffeine groups using generalised mixed models with adjustment for the variables used in stratification (centre, gestational age at birth (continuous) and ethnicity (māori or non-māori)); potential confounding by socio-economic status (new zealand deprivation index) and infant sex; and non-independence of multiples (random effect). intervention effects will be presented as mean difference, ratio of geometric means (positively skewed data) or risk difference with 95% confidence interval. for categorical data, an estimate of relative effect will also be given (odds ratio, 95% confidence interval). a hypothesis test will be conducted for the primary outcome (two-tailed α = 0.05). missing data will not be imputed in the primary analysis. the primary analysis will use a modified intention-to-treat approach, which will exclude infants who are (i) randomised in error, i.e. are ineligible; or (ii) withdrawn by parents/caregivers prior to the collection of any outcome data. randomisation errors are expected to be uncommon due to the use of electronic screening and consenting procedures that are linked to the randomisation system. infants will be included in the primary analysis regardless of adherence to the intervention. a complete-case analysis approach will be used in the primary analysis. co-variates for primary analysis are collected at trial entry and missing data are expected to be rare. interim analyses {21b} there is no planned interim efficacy analysis, as it is anticipated that most of the trial sample will have been recruited prior to assessment of the primary outcome at 2.5 years’ corrected age. the data monitoring committee will review safety outcomes annually by masked intervention group. these include death before 2.5 years’ corrected age; tachycardia requiring dose reduction during the intervention period; study intervention dose reduction or discontinuation due to side effects or poor tolerance of the intervention; and other adverse events that are considered serious. based on safety data, the data monitoring committee will advise the trial steering committee if any amendments to the protocol or study procedures should be considered. methods for additional analyses (e.g. subgroup analyses) {20b} secondary analyses will be performed for the primary and critical secondary outcomes, including: 1. sensitivity analysis: compliance: excluding infants who were non-compliant with the study intervention (&lt; 80% of expected volume removed from the first bottle returned at 3 weeks post-randomisation) open label caffeine treatment: excluding infants who received open label caffeine neurological conditions: excluding participants with developmental delay due to conditions unrelated to preterm birth and caffeine therapy, e.g. traumatic brain injury, genetic disorders, and congenital brain malformations 2. imputation analysis: multiple imputation techniques may be considered if there are concerns about bias in effect estimates due to differential loss to follow-up among groups, especially if this is related to prognostic factors 3. subgroup analysis: ethnicity (māori, non-māori) sex (female, male) 4. economic evaluation (to be considered if caffeine citrate is effective at improving outcomes): cost of the caffeine citrate intervention : this will be estimated by quantifying the additional cost associated with consumables required for neonatal intervention (i.e. the total amount of caffeine citrate used) using a resource-based approach. health care service utilisation costs: a self-reported service use questionnaire will be used at follow-up to document health utilisation and costs (e.g. number of hospital days a patient was on a specific mode of respiratory support; emergency department, primary healthcare and therapy visit costs, other health service utilisation costs and surgical procedures; hospital admissions after the initial discharge; and the use of home oxygen) among participants. self-reported service use will be supplemented by electronic administrative data (i.e. the national minimum data set for hospital admissions) obtained with consent. this will use a resource-based costing approach that measures the inputs required to deliver a service (e.g. identify provision of care/number of visits) and applying market prices to each of these resources (e.g. cost/hour for healthcare visit). unit costs will be sourced from published aotearoa new zealand data (where available), and where they are unavailable, published international data (once its applicability to aotearoa new zealand’s context is thoroughly assessed) or local estimates. costs will be measured in current aotearoa new zealand dollars. economic and cost-effectiveness analysis: from a healthcare funder perspective, cost analysis will include direct healthcare costs (i.e. healthcare services, prescription charges), indirect costs (e.g. loss of caregiver productivity, caregiver missed days of work), and out-of-pocket expenses associated with the intervention. a cost-effectiveness analysis will be conducted under the consolidated health economic evaluation reporting guidelines [ 42 ] to examine caffeine citrate treatment’s likely impact on improving neurodevelopmental outcomes in the aotearoa new zealand context. an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio will be calculated to compare additional costs and health benefits associated with the caffeine citrate compared with control as a cost per survivor without neurodevelopment impairment (as measured by bsid iv) [ 43 ]. methods in analysis to handle protocol non-adherence and any statistical methods to handle missing data {20c} the primary analysis will be based on a modified intention-to-treat approach, as defined above {20a}. the analysis data set for the main report will include all participants with at least one primary or secondary outcome. if participants meet the modified intention-to-treat criteria but do not have any outcome data, their baseline characteristics will be described. multiple imputation methods may be considered in secondary analysis to address missing data. plans to give access to the full protocol, participant-level data and statistical code {31c} information regarding the trial is available to the public on the australian new zealand clinical trials registry https://www.anzctr.org.au/trial/registration/trialreview.aspx?id=384799&amp;isreview=true . statistical code and deidentified participant level data of consenting participants will be available after publication, on application, where the purpose meets aotearoa new zealand ethical standards and the trial’s māori data sovereignty policy as detailed in {26b}. oversight and monitoring composition of the coordinating centre and trial steering committee {5d} each trial site has a site lead investigator (usually a neonatal or general paediatrician) to provide day-to-day guidance and liaise with the trial steering committee. the trial steering committee, chaired by the principal investigator (jane alsweiler) is comprised of neonatologists and a respiratory paediatrician experienced in running large, randomised trials; māori academics; a statistician; and a paediatric pharmacist. they meet approximately quarterly or more often as required to discuss operational issues such as recruitment, compliance and adverse effects. the trial steering committee will be responsible for overseeing the publication of trial results in an accurate and timely manner at the conclusion of trial follow-up. composition of the data monitoring committee, its role and reporting structure {21a} the data monitoring committee has four independent members, including the chair, a paediatrician experienced in large, randomised trials; a neonatologist; a statistician; and a māori respiratory paediatrician. the data monitoring committee convened prior to the first randomisation to review the trial protocol and the terms of reference. the data monitoring committee is advisory to the trial steering committee, providing feedback to the principal investigator regarding any recommendations or concerns. the data monitoring committee will monitor recruitment, sample size assumptions, completeness of data acquisition, and evidence for group differences in the safety outcome measures. the data monitoring committee will convene yearly to advise the trial steering committee on trial continuation or protocol modification. once the intervention phase has finished, the data monitoring committee will remain an advisory body until publication. serious adverse events (death before 2.5 years corrected age or other as defined in {18a}) will be reported to the data monitoring committee within 48 h by the site primary investigator; adverse events will be reported at yearly intervals. data monitoring committee: ◦ professor stuart dalziel (chair) auckland, aotearoa new zealand ◦ associate professor kathryn beardsall (independent expert) cambridge, united kingdom ◦ associate professor greg gamble (independent statistician) auckland, aotearoa new zealand ◦ associate professor catherine a. byrnes (ngāti raukawa-ki-te-tonga; independent expert) auckland, aotearoa new zealand adverse event reporting and harms {22} the following serious adverse events and adverse events will be reported to the data monitoring committee: serious adverse events (reported spontaneously to the data monitoring committee within 48 h of the site primary investigator being notified): death before 2.5 years’ corrected age other serious adverse event (defined as immediately life-threatening; requires prolongation of existing hospitalisation or substantial escalation in care, or results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity) adverse events (systematically recorded in ecrfs and reported to the data monitoring committee annually): tachycardia requiring dose reduction during the intervention period study intervention dose reduced or discontinued due to side effects or poor tolerance of the intervention death before 2.5 years’ corrected age, tachycardia requiring dose reduction during the intervention period, and study intervention dose reduced or discontinued due to side effects or poor tolerance of the intervention are specified secondary outcomes recorded systematically for all participants and will be reported in the trial publication. if deemed trial related by the dmc, other serious adverse events will be reported in the trial publication using the neonatal adverse event severity scale framework [ 44 ]. frequency and plans for auditing trial conduct {23} data entry will be continuously audited for accuracy and completeness. protocol deviations, adverse effects, and recruitment will be audited periodically at the regular trial steering committee meetings. plans for communicating important protocol amendments to relevant parties (e.g. trial participants, ethical committees) {25} there have not been any major changes to the trial protocol since the trial began. minor changes and additions sought by the trial steering committee will be submitted for approval to relevant ethics committees, and then distributed and communicated to each participating site. dissemination plans {31a} results will be communicated to those parents/caregivers who requested to receive a trial report on the consent form. this will be sent via email and using lay language. results will also be disseminated back to māori communities. the results of the trial will be presented at national and international conferences and will be published in high-impact medical journals. media and social media opportunities will be sought to communicate the results to the public. discussion enteral caffeine citrate is a simple intervention that may improve developmental outcomes in the large cohort of infants born late preterm. the latte trial is a phase iii multi-centre, parallel two-arm, double-blind, placebo-controlled randomised superiority trial, which is powered to detect important differences in cognitive outcome at 2.5 years’ corrected age, the early developmental domain most predictive of later neurodevelopmental outcome. while it is promising that caffeine citrate reduces intermittent hypoxaemia in late preterm infants, assessment of meaningful longer-term outcomes will provide convincing evidence for the implementation of routine caffeine prophylaxis for all late preterm infants if it proves to be beneficial. this trial has taken an intentional approach to incorporating māori principles in trial design and promoting indigenous recruitment, data governance and data sovereignty, in order to pursue improved outcomes for indigenous peoples. trial status the current protocol is version number 1.3, dated 14/06/2024. recruitment commenced in may 2023 at kidz first hospital, auckland, with additional sites added over time. recruitment is expected to be completed in late 2025, with results available in 2028. data availability {29} applications to obtain study data may be made to the principal investigator and will be at the discretion of the trial steering committee. anonymised individual patient study data may be made available to researchers through a mediated process to ensure that aotearoa new zealand ethical standards and māori data sovereignty framework are upheld, as further detailed in {26b}. model consent forms, ecrf templates and the statistical analysis plan will be available on request.

## Methods
this phase iii multi-centre, parallel two-arm, double-blind, placebo-controlled randomised superiority trial will randomise 478 late preterm infants or twin pairs to receive caffeine citrate (loading dose 40 mg.kg −1 , then 20 mg.kg −1 daily) or placebo until 40 +0 weeks’ postmenstrual age. there is an intentional focus on the recruitment of infants of māori ethnicity to aspire to mana whakamārama (equal explanatory power for the māori population) given their over-representation in late preterm births. randomisation will be stratified by centre, gestation at birth (34, 35 or 36 completed weeks) and ethnicity (māori or non-māori). the primary outcome is the bayley scales of infant development 4th edition cognitive score at 2.5 years’ corrected age. primary analysis will be performed on a modified intention-to-treat basis, comparing outcomes between intervention groups using generalised mixed models with adjustment for stratification, potential confounding by socio-economic status and sex, and non-independence of multiples (random effect). discussion of early developmental domains, cognition is the most predictive of later neurodevelopmental outcome and intelligence quotient. prioritisation of the indigenous population within trials is important. if prophylactic caffeine citrate is found to improve neurodevelopment in late preterm infants, this could have a significant impact on the long-term quality of life and health and wellbeing of this large population of infants. trial registration anzctr actrn12622001344785. registered on 19 october 2022. peer review reports

and have poorer outcomes than their term counterparts. in countries such as the usa, the uk and aotearoa new zealand, 4.3% to 7.7% of infants are born late preterm [ 1 , 2 , 3 ]. in aotearoa new zealand, māori (indigenous peoples) infants make up 20% of the late preterm birth cohort [ 4 ]. compared to term infants, born at 37 +0 weeks’ gestation or later, late preterm infants have higher rates of death, cerebral palsy, developmental delay, cognitive impairment, behavioural disorders and low educational achievement [ 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 ] . in aotearoa new zealand, new zealand european pregnant people have lower rates of preterm delivery and preterm mortality than māori pregnant people [ 3 , 4 ]. the ongoing systemic privilege experienced by non-indigenous pregnant people is seen in other colonised countries such as australia, canada and the usa [ 11 ]. researchers have an obligation to consider health equity and indigenous involvement in all aspects of trial design as part of an intentional approach to improve outcomes for indigenous people [ 12 ]. as part of this process, this trial aims to recruit similar numbers of māori and non-māori infants to aspire to mana whakamārama (equal explanatory power) [ 12 , 13 ]. as part of this approach, guidance was sought and an emphasis placed on whakawhanaungatanga (culturally appropriate approaches and relationship building) throughout the trial, including recruitment and dissemination of results. intermittent hypoxaemia may explain the increased risk of neurodevelopmental impairment apnoeic episodes, or prolonged pauses in breathing, are common in very preterm infants (&lt; 32 weeks’ gestation) and can cause low oxygen saturations, contributing to brain injury, dysmaturation and neurodevelopmental impairment [ 14 ]. late preterm infants are less likely to develop apnoea than more premature infants [ 15 ]. however, in oximetry recordings they still have frequent brief, repetitive decreases in oxygen saturation called intermittent hypoxaemia, which usually continue until term corrected age [ 16 ]. like apnoea, intermittent hypoxaemia is associated with neurodevelopmental impairment in very preterm infants [ 17 ] and may contribute to poorer development in late preterm infants. caffeine may improve outcomes for late preterm infants outcomes in very preterm infants caffeine citrate is used routinely in very preterm infants to treat apnoea of prematurity. caffeine therapy in very low birth weight infants improves the proportion who survive without neurodevelopmental disability at 18 to 21 months [ 18 ]. a recent meta-analysis reported moderate certainty evidence of a reduction in bronchopulmonary dysplasia in neonates treated with caffeine and moderate certainty evidence of a reduction in motor impairment in mid-childhood [ 19 ]. the latte dosage trial the recent latte dosage trial was a phase ii, parallel, multi-arm, double-blinded, randomised placebo-controlled dosage trial, which investigated the effect of different daily doses of enteral caffeine citrate on intermittent hypoxaemia in late preterm infants [ 20 , 21 ]. the trial randomised 132 infants to receive an enteral caffeine citrate loading dose of 10, 20, 30 or 40 mg.kg −1 followed by a maintenance dose of 5, 10, 15 or 20 mg.kg day −1 , or an equal volume of placebo, daily until term postmenstrual age. the primary outcome was the frequency of intermittent hypoxaemia, defined as the average number of events per hour with oxygen saturation concentration ≥ 10% below baseline, measured by overnight oximetry 2 weeks after randomisation. caffeine citrate reduced the frequency of intermittent hypoxaemia, with 20 mg.kg −1 being the most effective dose, with nearly a 70% reduction in the geometric mean intermittent hypoxaemia hourly event rate. caffeine also increased the mean peripheral oxygen saturation (spo 2 ) and reduced the amount of time spent with spo 2 less than 90%. there were no adverse effects of caffeine citrate on growth, feeding or sleep. caffeine increased the mean heart rate, with a significantly higher incidence of tachycardia in all caffeine groups compared to placebo. the latte trial caffeine to improve neurodevelopmental outcomes in infants born late preterm (the latte trial) is a phase iii multi-centre, parallel two-arm, double-blind, placebo-controlled randomised superiority trial of caffeine citrate in late preterm infants to improve the cognitive score at 2.5 years’ corrected age. the latte trial will assess the childhood outcomes of prophylactic enteral caffeine citrate administration in late preterm infants to provide robust evidence of the safety and efficacy of prophylactic caffeine citrate to improve neurodevelopment in late preterm infants. significance prophylactic enteral caffeine citrate is an accessible and economically viable intervention. if successful, this intervention has the potential to impact millions of late preterm infants worldwide [ 22 ]. given the prevalence of late preterm birth for māori, this has the potential to improve health and wellbeing for these infants and their whānau (extended families). though the latte dosage trial demonstrated an improvement in intermittent hypoxaemia and mean oxygen saturation, evidence of long-term neurodevelopmental benefits would provide further evidence for introducing this therapy routinely. objectives {7} to determine if prophylactic enteral caffeine citrate, given to infants born late preterm (34 + 0 to 36 + 6 weeks’ gestation) from birth to term postmenstrual age, improves neurodevelopmental outcome at 2.5 years’ corrected age. trial design {8} in this phase iii multi-centre, parallel two-arm, double-blind, placebo-controlled randomised superiority trial, eligible late preterm infants will be randomised online in a 1:1 ratio, to caffeine citrate or placebo, with stratification for study site groups, gestational age (34, 35 or 36 weeks) and ethnicity (māori or non-māori). methods: participants, interventions and outcomes study setting {9} infants will be recruited at secondary and tertiary maternity hospitals in aotearoa new zealand. they will be randomised and receive the loading dose of the study intervention while in hospital. once the infant is discharged home, the parents/caregivers will continue to give a daily dose of the study intervention until 40 +0 weeks postmenstrual age. at the time of submission for publication, the participating sites are: ◦ whangārei hospital ◦ north shore hospital ◦ waitakere hospital ◦ auckland city hospital ◦ kidz first hospital ◦ waikato hospital ◦ tauranga hospital ◦ whakatāne hospital ◦ rotorua hospital ◦ taranaki base hospital ◦ hawke’s bay hospital ◦ palmerston north regional hospital ◦ dunedin hospital eligibility criteria {10} inclusion criteria: infants born at 34 +0 to 36 +6 weeks’ gestation with no contraindication to caffeine treatment, whose parent/caregiver is able and willing to provide informed consent exclusion criteria: major congenital abnormality minor congenital abnormality likely to affect respiration, growth, or development previous caffeine treatment renal or hepatic impairment tachyarrhythmia seizures hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy maternal age less than 16 years more than 72 h after birth multiple births of triplets or higher who will take informed consent? {26a} parents/caregivers of eligible infants will be approached by a research nurse, research midwife, investigator, or neonatal clinical staff member in the first 72 h after birth as part of whakawhanaungatanga. parents/caregivers will receive written and verbal information about the trial, and any questions will be answered. parents/caregivers of participating infants will sign the informed consent form, and a copy will be provided to them. parents/caregivers are free to withdraw their infant from the trial at any time. the consent form includes an option to consent for information collected up to the point of withdrawal to continue to be processed. additional consent provisions for collection and use of participant data and biological specimens {26b} heart and mind sub-study the heart and mind sub-study will run concomitantly in selected centres. it has a separate protocol and will be reported separately. this sub-study will investigate cerebral blood flow and oxygenation following administration of the study intervention in up to 90 infants. these infants will undergo additional pulse oximetry, near infra-red spectroscopy, blood pressure and respiratory rate measurement, ultrasound and blood testing at baseline, after the loading dose and on day 5. consent to participate in this sub-study is provided in an optional section on the informed consent form. māori data sovereignty data collaborations with other researchers will only be considered if certain principles are met. these include that rightsholders and stakeholders in the study, especially māori, are consulted and engaged in the use and interpretation of study data; the use of study data upholds and is respectful of māori knowledge, worldviews and self-determination; patients are likely to derive benefit from the use of study data, including promotion of equitable outcomes; communities are not stigmatized or portrayed in terms of deficits, and a strengths-based lens is applied; and that the use of study data aligns with aotearoa new zealand ethical and māori data sovereignty frameworks and standards [ 12 , 23 , 24 ]. this process will be overseen collectively by the māori members of the trial steering committee. all participants are informed of the māori data sovereignty policy in the participant information sheet and are given the choice to consent for anonymised study data to be shared with approved researchers on the informed consent form. if this consent is not provided, data for these participants will not be shared with external researchers. interventions explanation for the choice of comparators {6b} the control intervention will be a placebo. at present, no prophylactic intervention is used routinely in late preterm infants to reduce intermittent hypoxemia or improve neurodevelopmental outcomes [ 16 ], so a placebo was considered appropriate. the placebo is the suspension vehicle used for the caffeine intervention, thus ensuring that the interventions have an identical appearance. the placebo will be given at an equivalent volume to the active intervention to preserve blinding. intervention description {11a} in the latte dosage trial, enteral caffeine citrate had a statistically significant effect, compared with placebo, on reducing the frequency of intermittent hypoxaemia at daily maintenance doses of 10 mg.kg −1 and 20 mg.kg −1 , but not at 15 mg.kg −1 [ 20 ]. the latte dosage trial recommended that future trials should consider using a 20 mg.kg −1 dose of caffeine citrate in late preterm infants due to a larger effect size in all respiratory measures and similar drug tolerability for the 20 mg.kg −1 dose compared to 10 mg.kg −1 . based on the findings of this study, a 40 mg.kg −1 loading dose followed by 20 mg.kg –1 day −1 maintenance until 40 +0 weeks’ postmenstrual age was chosen as the active intervention for the current trial. the latte dosage trial reported that when caffeine citrate was formulated in water, it was bitter at higher concentrations and difficult to administer orally in some late preterm infants [ 20 ]. therefore, for the current trial, the active intervention was formulated in a paediatric suspension vehicle, which contains sucrose and cherry flavouring (biomed ltd, auckland, aotearoa new zealand). the concentration of the active intervention is caffeine citrate 20 mg.ml −1 . infants will be given a 2 ml.kg −1 enteral loading dose of the study intervention (40 mg.kg −1 of caffeine citrate in the active intervention). the loading dose will be given prior to the infant reaching 96 h of age, followed by a daily dose of 1 ml.kg −1 each morning (20 mg.kg −1 of caffeine citrate in the active intervention) until 40 +0 weeks’ postmenstrual age. the dose will be recalculated at 3 weeks after randomisation for weight gain. two bottles of the study intervention from the same allocated group will be allocated at randomisation. the first bottle will be used for the first 3 weeks, and then returned to the study centre to determine compliance. the second bottle will be used after the first 3 weeks. the study intervention is given via a nasogastric tube for infants with a tube in situ, and orally for infants who do not require a nasogastric tube. infants who are not able to tolerate enteral medications will have the study intervention withheld until tolerance improves. criteria for discontinuing or modifying allocated interventions {11b} the dose of the study intervention may be reduced from 1 ml.kg −1 .day −1 (20 mg.kg −1 .day −1 caffeine citrate in the active intervention) to 0.5 ml.kg −1 .day −1 (10 mg.kg −1 .day −1 caffeine citrate in the active intervention) if the infant has tachycardia (heart rate consistently &gt; 180 beats per minute at rest) or if the parents/caregivers or clinicians believe the infant has side effects (at the discretion of the site lead investigator). if the parents/caregivers report difficulty administering the full volume, this can be administered as two half doses in the morning, e.g. with two separate feeds. the allocated intervention can be stopped at any time at the request of the parents/caregivers, or by the clinician caring for the infant if they believe that stopping the intervention would be in the best interest of the infant. if the intervention is stopped due to an acute illness or problem that resolves, consideration will be given to restarting the allocated intervention. infants should continue in the study and complete all planned assessments, regardless of adherence to the intervention, unless they are formally withdrawn from the study. outcome data collected up to the point of withdrawal will be reported (with consent). strategies to improve adherence to interventions {11c} where infants remain as inpatients, the study intervention will be charted on the inpatient medication chart to ensure it is given daily by, or under the supervision of, nursing or midwifery staff. the study team will ensure that the parents/caregivers feel comfortable administering the study intervention prior to discharge home. parents/caregivers will have the study team’s contact details to communicate any questions or concerns at any time after discharge home. the first bottle of study intervention will be collected at 3 weeks post randomisation (by courier if the infant has been discharged home), and the amount of study intervention remaining in the bottle will be determined. compliance will be defined as ≥ 80% of the predicted volume of the intervention dispensed. the study team will call the parents/caregivers at 3 weeks post randomisation to arrange the return of the first study bottle, weight-adjust the dose, and provide a reminder to continue the study intervention. they will then call at 40 +0 weeks’ postmenstrual age to remind parents/caregivers to cease the study intervention. relevant concomitant care permitted or prohibited during the trial {11d} all clinical care, other than study interventions and assessments, will be determined by the local clinical team, according to local guidelines. clinicians will be encouraged to use oxygen as first-line treatment for persistent hypoxaemia and positive pressure ventilation for apnoea or intermittent hypoxaemia. if necessary, clinicians can give a loading dose of caffeine citrate as an open-label medication. if a clinician decides to continue open-label caffeine treatment, the latte trial study intervention will be withheld until the open-label caffeine has been stopped. use of open-label caffeine treatment will be recorded. the trial analysis will be according to the allocated intervention group, regardless of any use of open-label caffeine. provisions for post-trial care {30} at the conclusion of early childhood follow up, parents/caregivers of children who have taken part in the study will be sent a letter summarising the results of the assessments, with information about who to contact if they have any questions. if there are concerns about a child’s health or developmental status, referral to an appropriate health agency, usually the child’s primary health provider, will be made with the consent of the parents/caregivers. parents, caregivers, and their health professionals will have the opportunity to request a more detailed report of specific assessment results if required. outcomes {12} primary outcome: mean bayley scales of infant development 4th edition (bsid iv) cognitive standard score at 2.5 years’ corrected age. main secondary outcomes: the following secondary outcomes at 2.5 years’ corrected age are considered critical in evaluating the study hypothesis: 1. cognitive delay (proportion with bsid iv cognitive standard score more than one standard deviation (sd) below the test mean, &lt; 85) 2. mean bsid iv language standard score 3. language delay (proportion with bsid iv language standard score more than one sd below the test mean, &lt; 85) 4. mean bsid iv motor standard score 5. motor delay (proportion with bsid iv motor standard score more than one sd below the mean, &lt; 85) 6. social-emotional/behavioural delay (proportion with bsid iv social-emotional score or bsid iv adaptive behaviour score more than one sd below the mean, &lt; 85) additional secondary outcomes: the following additional secondary outcomes will be reported to complement the evaluation of the active intervention: safety 1. proportion of participants who have died before 2.5 years’ corrected age 2. proportion of participants for whom the study intervention dose was reduced or discontinued due to side effects or poor tolerance of the intervention 3. proportion of participants who had tachycardia requiring dose reduction during the intervention period neonatal 4. mean weight, and weight z-score at 40 +0 weeks’ postmenstrual age 5. mean length of stay in hospital during the primary neonatal admission 6. proportion of participants fully breastfeeding at 40 +0 weeks’ postmenstrual age (the infant has taken breast milk only, no other liquids or solids except a minimal amount of water or prescribed medicines, in the past 48 h) early childhood outcomes at 2.5 years’ corrected age 7. moderate-severe cognitive delay (proportion with bsid iv cognitive standard score more than two sd below the test mean, &lt; 70). 8. moderate-severe language delay (proportion with bsid iv language standard score more than two sd below the test mean, &lt; 70). 9. moderate-severe motor delay (proportion with bsid iv motor standard score more than two sd below the test mean, &lt; 70). 10. developmental delay (proportion with bsid iv cognitive, language or motor standard score more than one sd below the test mean, &lt; 85). 11. high risk of school-age asthma (proportion with predicating asthma risk in childhood (parc) score ≥ 5) [ 25 ]. 12. asthma/wheeze (proportion with wheeze or whistling in the chest in the past 12 months or doctor diagnosed asthma (yes to parc #1/international study of asthma and allergy in childhood (isaac,[ 26 ]) #3 or isaac #7–8 questions)). 13. anthropometry (mean weight, height, head circumference and body mass index z -scores). 14. mean infant and toddler quality of life score (itqol). 15. healthcare utilisation after primary hospital discharge (linkage to routine data from the aotearoa new zealand ministry of health manatū hauora for emergency department visits, outpatient visits and hospitalisations, and parent questions on visits to primary healthcare providers). healthcare utilisation will be reported separately as a component of the health economic evaluation (see {20b}). participant timeline {13} the participant timeline is shown in fig. 1 . fig. 1 schedule of enrolment, interventions and assessments full size image sample size {14} a recent publication found that late preterm infants have a bsid cognitive score 5.3 points lower than term infants, equivalent to approximately one-third of a sd (sd 15) [ 27 ]. to detect a difference in bsid iv cognitive standard score between caffeine and placebo groups of at least 5 points with 90% power (two-sided α = 0.05) requires 191 infants in each arm (total 382). allowing for a conservative 20% drop-out rate (withdrawal and loss to follow-up), we will recruit a total of 478 infants (239 in each arm). infants from a multiple pregnancy may be recruited and will be allocated to the same intervention to avoid accidental cross-over. only one infant from a multiple pregnancy will be counted in the sample size, but all enrolled infants will be included in the modified intention-to-treat analysis. assuming a similar proportion of multiple births to that seen in the latte dosage trial ([ 20 ] ; the average number of infants per mother = 1.065), we expect to include a total of 510 infants if we achieve our target sample size of 478. we will place an emphasis on recruiting māori whānau in this study to assist mana whakamārama (equal explanatory power) to occur. to incorporate this principle, we will aim to recruit equal numbers of māori and non-māori infants. recruitment {15} late preterm infants make up at least 4.3% of births in aotearoa new zealand, or approximately 3000 cases annually [ 3 , 4 ]. the inclusion and exclusion criteria mean that most late preterm infants born at trial sites would be eligible for the latte trial. at time of publication, the five largest tertiary hospital birthing centres in aotearoa new zealand had commenced recruitment [ 4 ]. given that māori make up to 20% of the preterm population, strategies to enhance māori recruitment and retention include an intentional focus on whakawhanaungatanga with parents/caregivers approached by a research nurse/midwife, investigator or māori advisor antenatally or in the early postnatal period to discuss the trial; involvement of whānau and offering of kai (food) and koha (gift or contribution) at trial entry and follow-up visits where appropriate [ 28 ]. assignment of interventions: allocation sequence generation {16a} the allocation sequence will be generated by the study statistician, with stratification for centre (auckland city hospital, kidz first hospital, waikato hospital, dunedin hospital, north island special care baby units and south island special care baby units), gestational length (34, 35 or 36 weeks’ completed gestation) and ethnicity (māori or non-māori). infants from a multiple pregnancy will be allocated to the same study intervention due to the risk of intervention cross-over. concealment mechanism {16b} infants will be assigned randomly via an internet randomisation service to the placebo or caffeine citrate intervention with equal allocation ratio (1:1) according to the generated allocation sequence. only the study statistician, data manager and compounding pharmacy team will have access to the allocation sequence during the trial. personnel with access to the allocation sequence will not be involved in the recruitment of participants, provision of the intervention or outcome assessment. implementation {16c} study personnel or neonatal clinical staff will enrol participants and perform randomisation. at randomisation, the infant will be assigned a unique study identification number and will be allocated a study intervention pack labelled with a random number. the intervention pack will contain two bottles of the appropriate intervention, identified only by the intervention pack random number. only the data manager and compounding pharmacy team will know whether the intervention pack contains the active or control intervention. the infant’s hospital sticker will be applied to the bottles, and the intervention will only be dispensed to that infant. assignment of interventions: blinding who will be blinded {17a} the research team (investigators, coordinator, students, research staff), clinical staff and the infant’s parents/caregivers will be blinded to intervention allocation. this will be achieved by dispensing the intervention in identical bottles containing identical appearing solutions (caffeine and placebo) and labelled with a random number. only the data manager, study statistician and the compounding pharmacy team will have access to the allocation sequence during the trial, and only the data manager and compounding pharmacy team will know the contents of the study bottles. the data manager, study statistician and the compounding pharmacy team will have no direct contact with participants. procedure for unblinding if needed {17b} the clinical team caring for the infant may be unblinded if they consider it necessary for the provision of appropriate clinical care. this decision will be made in conjunction with the site lead investigator. in such an instance, the site lead investigator will contact the data manager and ask them to contact the responsible clinician with the study allocation. study personnel performing outcome assessments will remain blinded at all times. data collection and management plans for assessment and collection of outcomes {18a} the following baseline demographic and contact data will be collected at enrolment from parents/caregivers or the infant’s medical record: infant sex infant ethnicity, including hapū and iwi for māori participants (self-reported by parents/caregivers) [ 29 ] estimated date of birth (for calculating corrected age) infant date of birth birthweight customised birthweight centile [ 30 ] birth length birth head circumference maternal height and weight maternal age and parity pregnancy complications: gestational diabetes, pregestational diabetes, pre-eclampsia, antenatally diagnosed foetal growth restriction, smoking and drug use in pregnancy, antenatal corticosteroid administration, preterm prelabour rupture of membranes, induction of labour, mode of birth, place of birth, 5-min apgar score current respiratory support contact information, including social media, for the parents/caregivers, another close friend or relative, and primary care practitioner. the following data will be collected in the neonatal phase from parents/caregivers, the infant’s medical record or measurements conducted by study personnel: secondary outcomes listed in {12} date and time of loading dose administration neonatal care before and after randomisation: admission to neonatal or special baby care and reason for admission, respiratory support type and duration, apnoea, hypoglycaemia and severity, bacterial infection, date and time of admission and discharge from neonatal or special baby care heart/pulse rate at 1 week (3–8 days) post-randomisation or pre-discharge (whichever occurs first, but at least 72 h after randomisation) date of primary hospital discharge to calculate length of hospital stay for primary neonatal admission concurrent medications taken while the infant is receiving the study intervention weight at 3 weeks post-randomisation to calculate dose adjustment weight of returned bottle of study intervention to calculate compliance the following data will be collected in the early childhood phase from parents/caregivers or assessments conducted by study personnel: primary and secondary outcomes listed in {12} the following safety data will be collected from parents/caregivers, the infant’s medical record or measurements conducted by study personnel: death before 2.5 years’ corrected age (serious adverse event) tachycardia requiring dose reduction during the intervention period study intervention dose reduced or discontinued due to side effects or poor tolerance of the intervention any other adverse event that is considered serious (defined as immediately life-threatening; requires substantial prolongation of existing hospitalisation or escalation in care, or results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity) the following derived variables will be calculated at analysis: socioeconomic decile will be determined from the new zealand deprivation index [ 31 ], calculated from the mother’s address at trial entry gestation and sex-specific z -scores for weight, length and head circumference at birth, and weight z -score at term equivalent age will be calculated using the fenton population reference [ 32 ] age and sex-specific z -scores at 2.5 years’ corrected age for weight, length, bmi, and head circumference will be calculated using the who child growth standards [ 33 ] customised birthweight centiles will be converted to z -scores under the normal distribution baseline demographic, contact data and neonatal data will be recorded by study personnel who have been trained in the use of the study data management systems and data dictionary. early-childhood outcome assessment and recording of data will be conducted by assessors who will be trained in administering and scoring the bsid iv and performing anthropometry for the 2.5-year assessments. all bsid scoring will be performed using an electronic calculator based on age from the estimated date of birth (best obstetric estimate). early-childhood outcome assessors will be trained in the use of the study data management systems and data dictionary. parent questionnaires will be administered online around the time of the early-childhood assessment using the redcap system survey function. hard copy questionnaires will be available if internet access is not available. if questionnaires are completed on paper, the data will be entered into the redcap system by study personnel as soon as possible. support will be offered to parents/caregivers where questionnaires are not in their first language or when lower literacy may make completion of questionnaires difficult. the bsid iv is a structured assessment of cognitive, language and motor development for children up to 42 months. it is performed by a trained assessor, plus scales assessing social-emotional and adaptive behaviour, administered via caregiver questionnaire. it provides norm-referenced scores standardised in the australian and new zealand population. normative standard scores for the bsid iv cognitive, language and motor domains have a mean of 100 and a sd of 15. if a child is unable to complete testing in a domain due to disability or impairment, a score of 2 sd below the mean will be assigned. bsid iv scores are consistent with the bayley-iii, wechsler preschool and primary scale of intelligence and the peabody developmental motor scales [ 34 ]. cognitive scores at 2.5 years’ corrected age have a moderate to high positive correlation with later intelligence quotient, and, of all early developmental domains, cognitive scores are the most predictive of later neurodevelopmental outcomes [ 35 , 36 , 37 ]. the bayley adaptive behaviour and social-emotional scales are parent questionnaires, based on the vineland adaptive behaviour scales third edition and the greenspan social-emotional scales questionnaire for infants and young children, respectively [ 38 ]. at 18–24 months, bsid scale scores are correlated with intelligence and behaviour at school age [ 39 ]. the parc is a 10-item questionnaire focussing on wheezing and related symptoms and risk factors that has been validated for predicting childhood asthma [ 40 ]. the itqol short form assesses parent-reported general health and health-related quality of life based on 47 items that are combined into a transformed scale from 0 (worst health) to 100 (best health) and has been reported to be a reliable and valid alternative to the 97-item itqol [ 41 ]. plans to promote participant retention and complete follow-up {18b} infants will continue in the study and complete all planned assessments, regardless of adherence to the intervention, unless they are formally withdrawn from the study. if the study intervention is ceased temporarily, such as during an acute illness or problem that resolves, consideration will be given to restarting the study intervention. we will contact infants’ parents/caregivers with yearly birthday cards, which include a reminder to update changing contact details. we will trace families for whom current contact information is not available via their primary health provider, midwife or other family members. the trial’s focus on whakawhanaungatanga with parents/caregivers will support retention and tracing. all infants born in aotearoa new zealand are allocated a national health index (nhi) number at birth (national medical record number, mrn). they are entered into a national nhi database, which records contact information and is updated at each contact with secondary or tertiary care. the nhi will be recorded and can be used for tracing participants, if required. a koha will be given to participants at enrolment and 2.5-year follow-up. data management {19} data will be collected directly into ecrfs or electronic surveys using the redcap system. branching logic and range checks will be used to reduce data entry errors. hard copy forms will be available if internet access is not available, and data will be transferred to the redcap system as soon as possible. a data monitor will review each ecrf and survey for completeness before locking forms. if needed, queries will be raised with the site research team and tracked in redcap. a data management plan has been developed to complement the trial protocol, which is available upon request. confidentiality {27} the redcap system will run on amazon web services web and database cloud servers located in sydney, australia, with configuration and security operated by the medical research institute of new zealand. the trial steering group acknowledges that hosting indigenous data on aotearoa new zealand servers would be preferable; however, an appropriate service was not identified prior to trial commencement. web access will be controlled by unique user identification and password, two-factor authentication and user-level privileges, with a full electronic audit trail. participant privacy will be enhanced by the use of three separate redcap projects. project one will store screening data, including infant and maternal nhi/mrn and date of birth (to calculate chronological age); expected date of delivery (to calculate gestation length); infant birthweight, sex and ethnicity; and eligibility criteria. this will enable the reporting of consort data and assessment of external validity. records in project one will be labelled with a unique screening number to allow anonymisation of screening data for non-randomised infants at the completion of the study. project one will also support electronic consent (if eligible); randomisation (if eligible and consented); generate a unique study identification number at randomisation; and allocate intervention packs. following randomisation, records will be created automatically in projects two and three. project two will store baseline data, primary and secondary outcomes, safety data, survey data and sub-study data. records in project two will be identified only by the study identification number. project two will contain no identifiable data other than dates that are essential for calculations. project three will store contact information and identifiable data. records in project three will be identified by the unique study number and will contain nhi/mrn. data access groups will be employed so that site personnel can only see data for participants at their site. the download of data will be restricted to the data manager, study coordinator, principal investigator and study statistician, and only the data manager and principal investigator will be able to download identifiers. extracted data files will contain the indirect identifiers date of birth and estimated date of delivery, as these are necessary for analysis. no direct identifiers such as nhi/mrn, name, or address will be combined with study outcome data. study reports will contain only summary data, and individual participant data will not be reported. identifiers will not be released to any third party. research staff will be certified in best practice for clinical trials. at the completion of the study, deidentified study data will be permanently digitally archived with the university of auckland research data storage services in aotearoa new zealand. a digital reidentification key will be stored separate from the study data and will be accessible only to the senior investigators and head of department, or their representatives. plans for collection, laboratory evaluation and storage of biological specimens for genetic or molecular analysis in this trial/future use {33} blood gas samples for the heart and mind sub-study will be processed immediately. no biological samples will be stored for future analysis or use. statistical methods statistical methods for primary and secondary outcomes {20a} a detailed statistical analysis plan will be finalised and will be made publicly available prior to database lock. the primary analysis will compare primary and secondary outcomes between the placebo and caffeine groups using generalised mixed models with adjustment for the variables used in stratification (centre, gestational age at birth (continuous) and ethnicity (māori or non-māori)); potential confounding by socio-economic status (new zealand deprivation index) and infant sex; and non-independence of multiples (random effect). intervention effects will be presented as mean difference, ratio of geometric means (positively skewed data) or risk difference with 95% confidence interval. for categorical data, an estimate of relative effect will also be given (odds ratio, 95% confidence interval). a hypothesis test will be conducted for the primary outcome (two-tailed α = 0.05). missing data will not be imputed in the primary analysis. the primary analysis will use a modified intention-to-treat approach, which will exclude infants who are (i) randomised in error, i.e. are ineligible; or (ii) withdrawn by parents/caregivers prior to the collection of any outcome data. randomisation errors are expected to be uncommon due to the use of electronic screening and consenting procedures that are linked to the randomisation system. infants will be included in the primary analysis regardless of adherence to the intervention. a complete-case analysis approach will be used in the primary analysis. co-variates for primary analysis are collected at trial entry and missing data are expected to be rare. interim analyses {21b} there is no planned interim efficacy analysis, as it is anticipated that most of the trial sample will have been recruited prior to assessment of the primary outcome at 2.5 years’ corrected age. the data monitoring committee will review safety outcomes annually by masked intervention group. these include death before 2.5 years’ corrected age; tachycardia requiring dose reduction during the intervention period; study intervention dose reduction or discontinuation due to side effects or poor tolerance of the intervention; and other adverse events that are considered serious. based on safety data, the data monitoring committee will advise the trial steering committee if any amendments to the protocol or study procedures should be considered. methods for additional analyses (e.g. subgroup analyses) {20b} secondary analyses will be performed for the primary and critical secondary outcomes, including: 1. sensitivity analysis: compliance: excluding infants who were non-compliant with the study intervention (&lt; 80% of expected volume removed from the first bottle returned at 3 weeks post-randomisation) open label caffeine treatment: excluding infants who received open label caffeine neurological conditions: excluding participants with developmental delay due to conditions unrelated to preterm birth and caffeine therapy, e.g. traumatic brain injury, genetic disorders, and congenital brain malformations 2. imputation analysis: multiple imputation techniques may be considered if there are concerns about bias in effect estimates due to differential loss to follow-up among groups, especially if this is related to prognostic factors 3. subgroup analysis: ethnicity (māori, non-māori) sex (female, male) 4. economic evaluation (to be considered if caffeine citrate is effective at improving outcomes): cost of the caffeine citrate intervention : this will be estimated by quantifying the additional cost associated with consumables required for neonatal intervention (i.e. the total amount of caffeine citrate used) using a resource-based approach. health care service utilisation costs: a self-reported service use questionnaire will be used at follow-up to document health utilisation and costs (e.g. number of hospital days a patient was on a specific mode of respiratory support; emergency department, primary healthcare and therapy visit costs, other health service utilisation costs and surgical procedures; hospital admissions after the initial discharge; and the use of home oxygen) among participants. self-reported service use will be supplemented by electronic administrative data (i.e. the national minimum data set for hospital admissions) obtained with consent. this will use a resource-based costing approach that measures the inputs required to deliver a service (e.g. identify provision of care/number of visits) and applying market prices to each of these resources (e.g. cost/hour for healthcare visit). unit costs will be sourced from published aotearoa new zealand data (where available), and where they are unavailable, published international data (once its applicability to aotearoa new zealand’s context is thoroughly assessed) or local estimates. costs will be measured in current aotearoa new zealand dollars. economic and cost-effectiveness analysis: from a healthcare funder perspective, cost analysis will include direct healthcare costs (i.e. healthcare services, prescription charges), indirect costs (e.g. loss of caregiver productivity, caregiver missed days of work), and out-of-pocket expenses associated with the intervention. a cost-effectiveness analysis will be conducted under the consolidated health economic evaluation reporting guidelines [ 42 ] to examine caffeine citrate treatment’s likely impact on improving neurodevelopmental outcomes in the aotearoa new zealand context. an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio will be calculated to compare additional costs and health benefits associated with the caffeine citrate compared with control as a cost per survivor without neurodevelopment impairment (as measured by bsid iv) [ 43 ]. methods in analysis to handle protocol non-adherence and any statistical methods to handle missing data {20c} the primary analysis will be based on a modified intention-to-treat approach, as defined above {20a}. the analysis data set for the main report will include all participants with at least one primary or secondary outcome. if participants meet the modified intention-to-treat criteria but do not have any outcome data, their baseline characteristics will be described. multiple imputation methods may be considered in secondary analysis to address missing data. plans to give access to the full protocol, participant-level data and statistical code {31c} information regarding the trial is available to the public on the australian new zealand clinical trials registry https://www.anzctr.org.au/trial/registration/trialreview.aspx?id=384799&amp;isreview=true . statistical code and deidentified participant level data of consenting participants will be available after publication, on application, where the purpose meets aotearoa new zealand ethical standards and the trial’s māori data sovereignty policy as detailed in {26b}. oversight and monitoring composition of the coordinating centre and trial steering committee {5d} each trial site has a site lead investigator (usually a neonatal or general paediatrician) to provide day-to-day guidance and liaise with the trial steering committee. the trial steering committee, chaired by the principal investigator (jane alsweiler) is comprised of neonatologists and a respiratory paediatrician experienced in running large, randomised trials; māori academics; a statistician; and a paediatric pharmacist. they meet approximately quarterly or more often as required to discuss operational issues such as recruitment, compliance and adverse effects. the trial steering committee will be responsible for overseeing the publication of trial results in an accurate and timely manner at the conclusion of trial follow-up. composition of the data monitoring committee, its role and reporting structure {21a} the data monitoring committee has four independent members, including the chair, a paediatrician experienced in large, randomised trials; a neonatologist; a statistician; and a māori respiratory paediatrician. the data monitoring committee convened prior to the first randomisation to review the trial protocol and the terms of reference. the data monitoring committee is advisory to the trial steering committee, providing feedback to the principal investigator regarding any recommendations or concerns. the data monitoring committee will monitor recruitment, sample size assumptions, completeness of data acquisition, and evidence for group differences in the safety outcome measures. the data monitoring committee will convene yearly to advise the trial steering committee on trial continuation or protocol modification. once the intervention phase has finished, the data monitoring committee will remain an advisory body until publication. serious adverse events (death before 2.5 years corrected age or other as defined in {18a}) will be reported to the data monitoring committee within 48 h by the site primary investigator; adverse events will be reported at yearly intervals. data monitoring committee: ◦ professor stuart dalziel (chair) auckland, aotearoa new zealand ◦ associate professor kathryn beardsall (independent expert) cambridge, united kingdom ◦ associate professor greg gamble (independent statistician) auckland, aotearoa new zealand ◦ associate professor catherine a. byrnes (ngāti raukawa-ki-te-tonga; independent expert) auckland, aotearoa new zealand adverse event reporting and harms {22} the following serious adverse events and adverse events will be reported to the data monitoring committee: serious adverse events (reported spontaneously to the data monitoring committee within 48 h of the site primary investigator being notified): death before 2.5 years’ corrected age other serious adverse event (defined as immediately life-threatening; requires prolongation of existing hospitalisation or substantial escalation in care, or results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity) adverse events (systematically recorded in ecrfs and reported to the data monitoring committee annually): tachycardia requiring dose reduction during the intervention period study intervention dose reduced or discontinued due to side effects or poor tolerance of the intervention death before 2.5 years’ corrected age, tachycardia requiring dose reduction during the intervention period, and study intervention dose reduced or discontinued due to side effects or poor tolerance of the intervention are specified secondary outcomes recorded systematically for all participants and will be reported in the trial publication. if deemed trial related by the dmc, other serious adverse events will be reported in the trial publication using the neonatal adverse event severity scale framework [ 44 ]. frequency and plans for auditing trial conduct {23} data entry will be continuously audited for accuracy and completeness. protocol deviations, adverse effects, and recruitment will be audited periodically at the regular trial steering committee meetings. plans for communicating important protocol amendments to relevant parties (e.g. trial participants, ethical committees) {25} there have not been any major changes to the trial protocol since the trial began. minor changes and additions sought by the trial steering committee will be submitted for approval to relevant ethics committees, and then distributed and communicated to each participating site. dissemination plans {31a} results will be communicated to those parents/caregivers who requested to receive a trial report on the consent form. this will be sent via email and using lay language. results will also be disseminated back to māori communities. the results of the trial will be presented at national and international conferences and will be published in high-impact medical journals. media and social media opportunities will be sought to communicate the results to the public. discussion enteral caffeine citrate is a simple intervention that may improve developmental outcomes in the large cohort of infants born late preterm. the latte trial is a phase iii multi-centre, parallel two-arm, double-blind, placebo-controlled randomised superiority trial, which is powered to detect important differences in cognitive outcome at 2.5 years’ corrected age, the early developmental domain most predictive of later neurodevelopmental outcome. while it is promising that caffeine citrate reduces intermittent hypoxaemia in late preterm infants, assessment of meaningful longer-term outcomes will provide convincing evidence for the implementation of routine caffeine prophylaxis for all late preterm infants if it proves to be beneficial. this trial has taken an intentional approach to incorporating māori principles in trial design and promoting indigenous recruitment, data governance and data sovereignty, in order to pursue improved outcomes for indigenous peoples. trial status the current protocol is version number 1.3, dated 14/06/2024. recruitment commenced in may 2023 at kidz first hospital, auckland, with additional sites added over time. recruitment is expected to be completed in late 2025, with results available in 2028. data availability {29} applications to obtain study data may be made to the principal investigator and will be at the discretion of the trial steering committee. anonymised individual patient study data may be made available to researchers through a mediated process to ensure that aotearoa new zealand ethical standards and māori data sovereignty framework are upheld, as further detailed in {26b}. model consent forms, ecrf templates and the statistical analysis plan will be available on request. abbreviations spo 2 : peripheral oxygen saturation bsid iv: bayley scales of infant development 4th edition sd: standard deviation parc:

## Results
of the assessments, with information about who to contact if they have any questions. if there are concerns about a child’s health or developmental status, referral to an appropriate health agency, usually the child’s primary health provider, will be made with the consent of the parents/caregivers. parents, caregivers, and their health professionals will have the opportunity to request a more detailed report of specific assessment results if required. outcomes {12} primary outcome: mean bayley scales of infant development 4th edition (bsid iv) cognitive standard score at 2.5 years’ corrected age. main secondary outcomes: the following secondary outcomes at 2.5 years’ corrected age are considered critical in evaluating the study hypothesis: 1. cognitive delay (proportion with bsid iv cognitive standard score more than one standard deviation (sd) below the test mean, &lt; 85) 2. mean bsid iv language standard score 3. language delay (proportion with bsid iv language standard score more than one sd below the test mean, &lt; 85) 4. mean bsid iv motor standard score 5. motor delay (proportion with bsid iv motor standard score more than one sd below the mean, &lt; 85) 6. social-emotional/behavioural delay (proportion with bsid iv social-emotional score or bsid iv adaptive behaviour score more than one sd below the mean, &lt; 85) additional secondary outcomes: the following additional secondary outcomes will be reported to complement the evaluation of the active intervention: safety 1. proportion of participants who have died before 2.5 years’ corrected age 2. proportion of participants for whom the study intervention dose was reduced or discontinued due to side effects or poor tolerance of the intervention 3. proportion of participants who had tachycardia requiring dose reduction during the intervention period neonatal 4. mean weight, and weight z-score at 40 +0 weeks’ postmenstrual age 5. mean length of stay in hospital during the primary neonatal admission 6. proportion of participants fully breastfeeding at 40 +0 weeks’ postmenstrual age (the infant has taken breast milk only, no other liquids or solids except a minimal amount of water or prescribed medicines, in the past 48 h) early childhood outcomes at 2.5 years’ corrected age 7. moderate-severe cognitive delay (proportion with bsid iv cognitive standard score more than two sd below the test mean, &lt; 70). 8. moderate-severe language delay (proportion with bsid iv language standard score more than two sd below the test mean, &lt; 70). 9. moderate-severe motor delay (proportion with bsid iv motor standard score more than two sd below the test mean, &lt; 70). 10. developmental delay (proportion with bsid iv cognitive, language or motor standard score more than one sd below the test mean, &lt; 85). 11. high risk of school-age asthma (proportion with predicating asthma risk in childhood (parc) score ≥ 5) [ 25 ]. 12. asthma/wheeze (proportion with wheeze or whistling in the chest in the past 12 months or doctor diagnosed asthma (yes to parc #1/international study of asthma and allergy in childhood (isaac,[ 26 ]) #3 or isaac #7–8 questions)). 13. anthropometry (mean weight, height, head circumference and body mass index z -scores). 14. mean infant and toddler quality of life score (itqol). 15. healthcare utilisation after primary hospital discharge (linkage to routine data from the aotearoa new zealand ministry of health manatū hauora for emergency department visits, outpatient visits and hospitalisations, and parent questions on visits to primary healthcare providers). healthcare utilisation will be reported separately as a component of the health economic evaluation (see {20b}). participant timeline {13} the participant timeline is shown in fig. 1 . fig. 1 schedule of enrolment, interventions and assessments full size image sample size {14} a recent publication found that late preterm infants have a bsid cognitive score 5.3 points lower than term infants, equivalent to approximately one-third of a sd (sd 15) [ 27 ]. to detect a difference in bsid iv cognitive standard score between caffeine and placebo groups of at least 5 points with 90% power (two-sided α = 0.05) requires 191 infants in each arm (total 382). allowing for a conservative 20% drop-out rate (withdrawal and loss to follow-up), we will recruit a total of 478 infants (239 in each arm). infants from a multiple pregnancy may be recruited and will be allocated to the same intervention to avoid accidental cross-over. only one infant from a multiple pregnancy will be counted in the sample size, but all enrolled infants will be included in the modified intention-to-treat analysis. assuming a similar proportion of multiple births to that seen in the latte dosage trial ([ 20 ] ; the average number of infants per mother = 1.065), we expect to include a total of 510 infants if we achieve our target sample size of 478. we will place an emphasis on recruiting māori whānau in this study to assist mana whakamārama (equal explanatory power) to occur. to incorporate this principle, we will aim to recruit equal numbers of māori and non-māori infants. recruitment {15} late preterm infants make up at least 4.3% of births in aotearoa new zealand, or approximately 3000 cases annually [ 3 , 4 ]. the inclusion and exclusion criteria mean that most late preterm infants born at trial sites would be eligible for the latte trial. at time of publication, the five largest tertiary hospital birthing centres in aotearoa new zealand had commenced recruitment [ 4 ]. given that māori make up to 20% of the preterm population, strategies to enhance māori recruitment and retention include an intentional focus on whakawhanaungatanga with parents/caregivers approached by a research nurse/midwife, investigator or māori advisor antenatally or in the early postnatal period to discuss the trial; involvement of whānau and offering of kai (food) and koha (gift or contribution) at trial entry and follow-up visits where appropriate [ 28 ]. assignment of interventions: allocation sequence generation {16a} the allocation sequence will be generated by the study statistician, with stratification for centre (auckland city hospital, kidz first hospital, waikato hospital, dunedin hospital, north island special care baby units and south island special care baby units), gestational length (34, 35 or 36 weeks’ completed gestation) and ethnicity (māori or non-māori). infants from a multiple pregnancy will be allocated to the same study intervention due to the risk of intervention cross-over. concealment mechanism {16b} infants will be assigned randomly via an internet randomisation service to the placebo or caffeine citrate intervention with equal allocation ratio (1:1) according to the generated allocation sequence. only the study statistician, data manager and compounding pharmacy team will have access to the allocation sequence during the trial. personnel with access to the allocation sequence will not be involved in the recruitment of participants, provision of the intervention or outcome assessment. implementation {16c} study personnel or neonatal clinical staff will enrol participants and perform randomisation. at randomisation, the infant will be assigned a unique study identification number and will be allocated a study intervention pack labelled with a random number. the intervention pack will contain two bottles of the appropriate intervention, identified only by the intervention pack random number. only the data manager and compounding pharmacy team will know whether the intervention pack contains the active or control intervention. the infant’s hospital sticker will be applied to the bottles, and the intervention will only be dispensed to that infant. assignment of interventions: blinding who will be blinded {17a} the research team (investigators, coordinator, students, research staff), clinical staff and the infant’s parents/caregivers will be blinded to intervention allocation. this will be achieved by dispensing the intervention in identical bottles containing identical appearing solutions (caffeine and placebo) and labelled with a random number. only the data manager, study statistician and the compounding pharmacy team will have access to the allocation sequence during the trial, and only the data manager and compounding pharmacy team will know the contents of the study bottles. the data manager, study statistician and the compounding pharmacy team will have no direct contact with participants. procedure for unblinding if needed {17b} the clinical team caring for the infant may be unblinded if they consider it necessary for the provision of appropriate clinical care. this decision will be made in conjunction with the site lead investigator. in such an instance, the site lead investigator will contact the data manager and ask them to contact the responsible clinician with the study allocation. study personnel performing outcome assessments will remain blinded at all times. data collection and management plans for assessment and collection of outcomes {18a} the following baseline demographic and contact data will be collected at enrolment from parents/caregivers or the infant’s medical record: infant sex infant ethnicity, including hapū and iwi for māori participants (self-reported by parents/caregivers) [ 29 ] estimated date of birth (for calculating corrected age) infant date of birth birthweight customised birthweight centile [ 30 ] birth length birth head circumference maternal height and weight maternal age and parity pregnancy complications: gestational diabetes, pregestational diabetes, pre-eclampsia, antenatally diagnosed foetal growth restriction, smoking and drug use in pregnancy, antenatal corticosteroid administration, preterm prelabour rupture of membranes, induction of labour, mode of birth, place of birth, 5-min apgar score current respiratory support contact information, including social media, for the parents/caregivers, another close friend or relative, and primary care practitioner. the following data will be collected in the neonatal phase from parents/caregivers, the infant’s medical record or measurements conducted by study personnel: secondary outcomes listed in {12} date and time of loading dose administration neonatal care before and after randomisation: admission to neonatal or special baby care and reason for admission, respiratory support type and duration, apnoea, hypoglycaemia and severity, bacterial infection, date and time of admission and discharge from neonatal or special baby care heart/pulse rate at 1 week (3–8 days) post-randomisation or pre-discharge (whichever occurs first, but at least 72 h after randomisation) date of primary hospital discharge to calculate length of hospital stay for primary neonatal admission concurrent medications taken while the infant is receiving the study intervention weight at 3 weeks post-randomisation to calculate dose adjustment weight of returned bottle of study intervention to calculate compliance the following data will be collected in the early childhood phase from parents/caregivers or assessments conducted by study personnel: primary and secondary outcomes listed in {12} the following safety data will be collected from parents/caregivers, the infant’s medical record or measurements conducted by study personnel: death before 2.5 years’ corrected age (serious adverse event) tachycardia requiring dose reduction during the intervention period study intervention dose reduced or discontinued due to side effects or poor tolerance of the intervention any other adverse event that is considered serious (defined as immediately life-threatening; requires substantial prolongation of existing hospitalisation or escalation in care, or results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity) the following derived variables will be calculated at analysis: socioeconomic decile will be determined from the new zealand deprivation index [ 31 ], calculated from the mother’s address at trial entry gestation and sex-specific z -scores for weight, length and head circumference at birth, and weight z -score at term equivalent age will be calculated using the fenton population reference [ 32 ] age and sex-specific z -scores at 2.5 years’ corrected age for weight, length, bmi, and head circumference will be calculated using the who child growth standards [ 33 ] customised birthweight centiles will be converted to z -scores under the normal distribution baseline demographic, contact data and neonatal data will be recorded by study personnel who have been trained in the use of the study data management systems and data dictionary. early-childhood outcome assessment and recording of data will be conducted by assessors who will be trained in administering and scoring the bsid iv and performing anthropometry for the 2.5-year assessments. all bsid scoring will be performed using an electronic calculator based on age from the estimated date of birth (best obstetric estimate). early-childhood outcome assessors will be trained in the use of the study data management systems and data dictionary. parent questionnaires will be administered online around the time of the early-childhood assessment using the redcap system survey function. hard copy questionnaires will be available if internet access is not available. if questionnaires are completed on paper, the data will be entered into the redcap system by study personnel as soon as possible. support will be offered to parents/caregivers where questionnaires are not in their first language or when lower literacy may make completion of questionnaires difficult. the bsid iv is a structured assessment of cognitive, language and motor development for children up to 42 months. it is performed by a trained assessor, plus scales assessing social-emotional and adaptive behaviour, administered via caregiver questionnaire. it provides norm-referenced scores standardised in the australian and new zealand population. normative standard scores for the bsid iv cognitive, language and motor domains have a mean of 100 and a sd of 15. if a child is unable to complete testing in a domain due to disability or impairment, a score of 2 sd below the mean will be assigned. bsid iv scores are consistent with the bayley-iii, wechsler preschool and primary scale of intelligence and the peabody developmental motor scales [ 34 ]. cognitive scores at 2.5 years’ corrected age have a moderate to high positive correlation with later intelligence quotient, and, of all early developmental domains, cognitive scores are the most predictive of later neurodevelopmental outcomes [ 35 , 36 , 37 ]. the bayley adaptive behaviour and social-emotional scales are parent questionnaires, based on the vineland adaptive behaviour scales third edition and the greenspan social-emotional scales questionnaire for infants and young children, respectively [ 38 ]. at 18–24 months, bsid scale scores are correlated with intelligence and behaviour at school age [ 39 ]. the parc is a 10-item questionnaire focussing on wheezing and related symptoms and risk factors that has been validated for predicting childhood asthma [ 40 ]. the itqol short form assesses parent-reported general health and health-related quality of life based on 47 items that are combined into a transformed scale from 0 (worst health) to 100 (best health) and has been reported to be a reliable and valid alternative to the 97-item itqol [ 41 ]. plans to promote participant retention and complete follow-up {18b} infants will continue in the study and complete all planned assessments, regardless of adherence to the intervention, unless they are formally withdrawn from the study. if the study intervention is ceased temporarily, such as during an acute illness or problem that resolves, consideration will be given to restarting the study intervention. we will contact infants’ parents/caregivers with yearly birthday cards, which include a reminder to update changing contact details. we will trace families for whom current contact information is not available via their primary health provider, midwife or other family members. the trial’s focus on whakawhanaungatanga with parents/caregivers will support retention and tracing. all infants born in aotearoa new zealand are allocated a national health index (nhi) number at birth (national medical record number, mrn). they are entered into a national nhi database, which records contact information and is updated at each contact with secondary or tertiary care. the nhi will be recorded and can be used for tracing participants, if required. a koha will be given to participants at enrolment and 2.5-year follow-up. data management {19} data will be collected directly into ecrfs or electronic surveys using the redcap system. branching logic and range checks will be used to reduce data entry errors. hard copy forms will be available if internet access is not available, and data will be transferred to the redcap system as soon as possible. a data monitor will review each ecrf and survey for completeness before locking forms. if needed, queries will be raised with the site research team and tracked in redcap. a data management plan has been developed to complement the trial protocol, which is available upon request. confidentiality {27} the redcap system will run on amazon web services web and database cloud servers located in sydney, australia, with configuration and security operated by the medical research institute of new zealand. the trial steering group acknowledges that hosting indigenous data on aotearoa new zealand servers would be preferable; however, an appropriate service was not identified prior to trial commencement. web access will be controlled by unique user identification and password, two-factor authentication and user-level privileges, with a full electronic audit trail. participant privacy will be enhanced by the use of three separate redcap projects. project one will store screening data, including infant and maternal nhi/mrn and date of birth (to calculate chronological age); expected date of delivery (to calculate gestation length); infant birthweight, sex and ethnicity; and eligibility criteria. this will enable the reporting of consort data and assessment of external validity. records in project one will be labelled with a unique screening number to allow anonymisation of screening data for non-randomised infants at the completion of the study. project one will also support electronic consent (if eligible); randomisation (if eligible and consented); generate a unique study identification number at randomisation; and allocate intervention packs. following randomisation, records will be created automatically in projects two and three. project two will store baseline data, primary and secondary outcomes, safety data, survey data and sub-study data. records in project two will be identified only by the study identification number. project two will contain no identifiable data other than dates that are essential for calculations. project three will store contact information and identifiable data. records in project three will be identified by the unique study number and will contain nhi/mrn. data access groups will be employed so that site personnel can only see data for participants at their site. the download of data will be restricted to the data manager, study coordinator, principal investigator and study statistician, and only the data manager and principal investigator will be able to download identifiers. extracted data files will contain the indirect identifiers date of birth and estimated date of delivery, as these are necessary for analysis. no direct identifiers such as nhi/mrn, name, or address will be combined with study outcome data. study reports will contain only summary data, and individual participant data will not be reported. identifiers will not be released to any third party. research staff will be certified in best practice for clinical trials. at the completion of the study, deidentified study data will be permanently digitally archived with the university of auckland research data storage services in aotearoa new zealand. a digital reidentification key will be stored separate from the study data and will be accessible only to the senior investigators and head of department, or their representatives. plans for collection, laboratory evaluation and storage of biological specimens for genetic or molecular analysis in this trial/future use {33} blood gas samples for the heart and mind sub-study will be processed immediately. no biological samples will be stored for future analysis or use. statistical methods statistical methods for primary and secondary outcomes {20a} a detailed statistical analysis plan will be finalised and will be made publicly available prior to database lock. the primary analysis will compare primary and secondary outcomes between the placebo and caffeine groups using generalised mixed models with adjustment for the variables used in stratification (centre, gestational age at birth (continuous) and ethnicity (māori or non-māori)); potential confounding by socio-economic status (new zealand deprivation index) and infant sex; and non-independence of multiples (random effect). intervention effects will be presented as mean difference, ratio of geometric means (positively skewed data) or risk difference with 95% confidence interval. for categorical data, an estimate of relative effect will also be given (odds ratio, 95% confidence interval). a hypothesis test will be conducted for the primary outcome (two-tailed α = 0.05). missing data will not be imputed in the primary analysis. the primary analysis will use a modified intention-to-treat approach, which will exclude infants who are (i) randomised in error, i.e. are ineligible; or (ii) withdrawn by parents/caregivers prior to the collection of any outcome data. randomisation errors are expected to be uncommon due to the use of electronic screening and consenting procedures that are linked to the randomisation system. infants will be included in the primary analysis regardless of adherence to the intervention. a complete-case analysis approach will be used in the primary analysis. co-variates for primary analysis are collected at trial entry and missing data are expected to be rare. interim analyses {21b} there is no planned interim efficacy analysis, as it is anticipated that most of the trial sample will have been recruited prior to assessment of the primary outcome at 2.5 years’ corrected age. the data monitoring committee will review safety outcomes annually by masked intervention group. these include death before 2.5 years’ corrected age; tachycardia requiring dose reduction during the intervention period; study intervention dose reduction or discontinuation due to side effects or poor tolerance of the intervention; and other adverse events that are considered serious. based on safety data, the data monitoring committee will advise the trial steering committee if any amendments to the protocol or study procedures should be considered. methods for additional analyses (e.g. subgroup analyses) {20b} secondary analyses will be performed for the primary and critical secondary outcomes, including: 1. sensitivity analysis: compliance: excluding infants who were non-compliant with the study intervention (&lt; 80% of expected volume removed from the first bottle returned at 3 weeks post-randomisation) open label caffeine treatment: excluding infants who received open label caffeine neurological conditions: excluding participants with developmental delay due to conditions unrelated to preterm birth and caffeine therapy, e.g. traumatic brain injury, genetic disorders, and congenital brain malformations 2. imputation analysis: multiple imputation techniques may be considered if there are concerns about bias in effect estimates due to differential loss to follow-up among groups, especially if this is related to prognostic factors 3. subgroup analysis: ethnicity (māori, non-māori) sex (female, male) 4. economic evaluation (to be considered if caffeine citrate is effective at improving outcomes): cost of the caffeine citrate intervention : this will be estimated by quantifying the additional cost associated with consumables required for neonatal intervention (i.e. the total amount of caffeine citrate used) using a resource-based approach. health care service utilisation costs: a self-reported service use questionnaire will be used at follow-up to document health utilisation and costs (e.g. number of hospital days a patient was on a specific mode of respiratory support; emergency department, primary healthcare and therapy visit costs, other health service utilisation costs and surgical procedures; hospital admissions after the initial discharge; and the use of home oxygen) among participants. self-reported service use will be supplemented by electronic administrative data (i.e. the national minimum data set for hospital admissions) obtained with consent. this will use a resource-based costing approach that measures the inputs required to deliver a service (e.g. identify provision of care/number of visits) and applying market prices to each of these resources (e.g. cost/hour for healthcare visit). unit costs will be sourced from published aotearoa new zealand data (where available), and where they are unavailable, published international data (once its applicability to aotearoa new zealand’s context is thoroughly assessed) or local estimates. costs will be measured in current aotearoa new zealand dollars. economic and cost-effectiveness analysis: from a healthcare funder perspective, cost analysis will include direct healthcare costs (i.e. healthcare services, prescription charges), indirect costs (e.g. loss of caregiver productivity, caregiver missed days of work), and out-of-pocket expenses associated with the intervention. a cost-effectiveness analysis will be conducted under the consolidated health economic evaluation reporting guidelines [ 42 ] to examine caffeine citrate treatment’s likely impact on improving neurodevelopmental outcomes in the aotearoa new zealand context. an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio will be calculated to compare additional costs and health benefits associated with the caffeine citrate compared with control as a cost per survivor without neurodevelopment impairment (as measured by bsid iv) [ 43 ]. methods in analysis to handle protocol non-adherence and any statistical methods to handle missing data {20c} the primary analysis will be based on a modified intention-to-treat approach, as defined above {20a}. the analysis data set for the main report will include all participants with at least one primary or secondary outcome. if participants meet the modified intention-to-treat criteria but do not have any outcome data, their baseline characteristics will be described. multiple imputation methods may be considered in secondary analysis to address missing data. plans to give access to the full protocol, participant-level data and statistical code {31c} information regarding the trial is available to the public on the australian new zealand clinical trials registry https://www.anzctr.org.au/trial/registration/trialreview.aspx?id=384799&amp;isreview=true . statistical code and deidentified participant level data of consenting participants will be available after publication, on application, where the purpose meets aotearoa new zealand ethical standards and the trial’s māori data sovereignty policy as detailed in {26b}. oversight and monitoring composition of the coordinating centre and trial steering committee {5d} each trial site has a site lead investigator (usually a neonatal or general paediatrician) to provide day-to-day guidance and liaise with the trial steering committee. the trial steering committee, chaired by the principal investigator (jane alsweiler) is comprised of neonatologists and a respiratory paediatrician experienced in running large, randomised trials; māori academics; a statistician; and a paediatric pharmacist. they meet approximately quarterly or more often as required to discuss operational issues such as recruitment, compliance and adverse effects. the trial steering committee will be responsible for overseeing the publication of trial results in an accurate and timely manner at the conclusion of trial follow-up. composition of the data monitoring committee, its role and reporting structure {21a} the data monitoring committee has four independent members, including the chair, a paediatrician experienced in large, randomised trials; a neonatologist; a statistician; and a māori respiratory paediatrician. the data monitoring committee convened prior to the first randomisation to review the trial protocol and the terms of reference. the data monitoring committee is advisory to the trial steering committee, providing feedback to the principal investigator regarding any recommendations or concerns. the data monitoring committee will monitor recruitment, sample size assumptions, completeness of data acquisition, and evidence for group differences in the safety outcome measures. the data monitoring committee will convene yearly to advise the trial steering committee on trial continuation or protocol modification. once the intervention phase has finished, the data monitoring committee will remain an advisory body until publication. serious adverse events (death before 2.5 years corrected age or other as defined in {18a}) will be reported to the data monitoring committee within 48 h by the site primary investigator; adverse events will be reported at yearly intervals. data monitoring committee: ◦ professor stuart dalziel (chair) auckland, aotearoa new zealand ◦ associate professor kathryn beardsall (independent expert) cambridge, united kingdom ◦ associate professor greg gamble (independent statistician) auckland, aotearoa new zealand ◦ associate professor catherine a. byrnes (ngāti raukawa-ki-te-tonga; independent expert) auckland, aotearoa new zealand adverse event reporting and harms {22} the following serious adverse events and adverse events will be reported to the data monitoring committee: serious adverse events (reported spontaneously to the data monitoring committee within 48 h of the site primary investigator being notified): death before 2.5 years’ corrected age other serious adverse event (defined as immediately life-threatening; requires prolongation of existing hospitalisation or substantial escalation in care, or results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity) adverse events (systematically recorded in ecrfs and reported to the data monitoring committee annually): tachycardia requiring dose reduction during the intervention period study intervention dose reduced or discontinued due to side effects or poor tolerance of the intervention death before 2.5 years’ corrected age, tachycardia requiring dose reduction during the intervention period, and study intervention dose reduced or discontinued due to side effects or poor tolerance of the intervention are specified secondary outcomes recorded systematically for all participants and will be reported in the trial publication. if deemed trial related by the dmc, other serious adverse events will be reported in the trial publication using the neonatal adverse event severity scale framework [ 44 ]. frequency and plans for auditing trial conduct {23} data entry will be continuously audited for accuracy and completeness. protocol deviations, adverse effects, and recruitment will be audited periodically at the regular trial steering committee meetings. plans for communicating important protocol amendments to relevant parties (e.g. trial participants, ethical committees) {25} there have not been any major changes to the trial protocol since the trial began. minor changes and additions sought by the trial steering committee will be submitted for approval to relevant ethics committees, and then distributed and communicated to each participating site. dissemination plans {31a} results will be communicated to those parents/caregivers who requested to receive a trial report on the consent form. this will be sent via email and using lay language. results will also be disseminated back to māori communities. the results of the trial will be presented at national and international conferences and will be published in high-impact medical journals. media and social media opportunities will be sought to communicate the results to the public. discussion enteral caffeine citrate is a simple intervention that may improve developmental outcomes in the large cohort of infants born late preterm. the latte trial is a phase iii multi-centre, parallel two-arm, double-blind, placebo-controlled randomised superiority trial, which is powered to detect important differences in cognitive outcome at 2.5 years’ corrected age, the early developmental domain most predictive of later neurodevelopmental outcome. while it is promising that caffeine citrate reduces intermittent hypoxaemia in late preterm infants, assessment of meaningful longer-term outcomes will provide convincing evidence for the implementation of routine caffeine prophylaxis for all late preterm infants if it proves to be beneficial. this trial has taken an intentional approach to incorporating māori principles in trial design and promoting indigenous recruitment, data governance and data sovereignty, in order to pursue improved outcomes for indigenous peoples. trial status the current protocol is version number 1.3, dated 14/06/2024. recruitment commenced in may 2023 at kidz first hospital, auckland, with additional sites added over time. recruitment is expected to be completed in late 2025, with results available in 2028. data availability {29} applications to obtain study data may be made to the principal investigator and will be at the discretion of the trial steering committee. anonymised individual patient study data may be made available to researchers through a mediated process to ensure that aotearoa new zealand ethical standards and māori data sovereignty framework are upheld, as further detailed in {26b}. model consent forms, ecrf templates and the statistical analysis plan will be available on request. abbreviations spo 2 : peripheral oxygen saturation bsid iv: bayley scales of infant development 4th edition sd: standard deviation parc:

## Discussion
of early developmental domains, cognition is the most predictive of later neurodevelopmental outcome and intelligence quotient. prioritisation of the indigenous population within trials is important. if prophylactic caffeine citrate is found to improve neurodevelopment in late preterm infants, this could have a significant impact on the long-term quality of life and health and wellbeing of this large population of infants. trial registration anzctr actrn12622001344785. registered on 19 october 2022. peer review reports administrative information note: the numbers in curly brackets in this

and have poorer outcomes than their term counterparts. in countries such as the usa, the uk and aotearoa new zealand, 4.3% to 7.7% of infants are born late preterm [ 1 , 2 , 3 ]. in aotearoa new zealand, māori (indigenous peoples) infants make up 20% of the late preterm birth cohort [ 4 ]. compared to term infants, born at 37 +0 weeks’ gestation or later, late preterm infants have higher rates of death, cerebral palsy, developmental delay, cognitive impairment, behavioural disorders and low educational achievement [ 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 ] . in aotearoa new zealand, new zealand european pregnant people have lower rates of preterm delivery and preterm mortality than māori pregnant people [ 3 , 4 ]. the ongoing systemic privilege experienced by non-indigenous pregnant people is seen in other colonised countries such as australia, canada and the usa [ 11 ]. researchers have an obligation to consider health equity and indigenous involvement in all aspects of trial design as part of an intentional approach to improve outcomes for indigenous people [ 12 ]. as part of this process, this trial aims to recruit similar numbers of māori and non-māori infants to aspire to mana whakamārama (equal explanatory power) [ 12 , 13 ]. as part of this approach, guidance was sought and an emphasis placed on whakawhanaungatanga (culturally appropriate approaches and relationship building) throughout the trial, including recruitment and dissemination of results. intermittent hypoxaemia may explain the increased risk of neurodevelopmental impairment apnoeic episodes, or prolonged pauses in breathing, are common in very preterm infants (&lt; 32 weeks’ gestation) and can cause low oxygen saturations, contributing to brain injury, dysmaturation and neurodevelopmental impairment [ 14 ]. late preterm infants are less likely to develop apnoea than more premature infants [ 15 ]. however, in oximetry recordings they still have frequent brief, repetitive decreases in oxygen saturation called intermittent hypoxaemia, which usually continue until term corrected age [ 16 ]. like apnoea, intermittent hypoxaemia is associated with neurodevelopmental impairment in very preterm infants [ 17 ] and may contribute to poorer development in late preterm infants. caffeine may improve outcomes for late preterm infants outcomes in very preterm infants caffeine citrate is used routinely in very preterm infants to treat apnoea of prematurity. caffeine therapy in very low birth weight infants improves the proportion who survive without neurodevelopmental disability at 18 to 21 months [ 18 ]. a recent meta-analysis reported moderate certainty evidence of a reduction in bronchopulmonary dysplasia in neonates treated with caffeine and moderate certainty evidence of a reduction in motor impairment in mid-childhood [ 19 ]. the latte dosage trial the recent latte dosage trial was a phase ii, parallel, multi-arm, double-blinded, randomised placebo-controlled dosage trial, which investigated the effect of different daily doses of enteral caffeine citrate on intermittent hypoxaemia in late preterm infants [ 20 , 21 ]. the trial randomised 132 infants to receive an enteral caffeine citrate loading dose of 10, 20, 30 or 40 mg.kg −1 followed by a maintenance dose of 5, 10, 15 or 20 mg.kg day −1 , or an equal volume of placebo, daily until term postmenstrual age. the primary outcome was the frequency of intermittent hypoxaemia, defined as the average number of events per hour with oxygen saturation concentration ≥ 10% below baseline, measured by overnight oximetry 2 weeks after randomisation. caffeine citrate reduced the frequency of intermittent hypoxaemia, with 20 mg.kg −1 being the most effective dose, with nearly a 70% reduction in the geometric mean intermittent hypoxaemia hourly event rate. caffeine also increased the mean peripheral oxygen saturation (spo 2 ) and reduced the amount of time spent with spo 2 less than 90%. there were no adverse effects of caffeine citrate on growth, feeding or sleep. caffeine increased the mean heart rate, with a significantly higher incidence of tachycardia in all caffeine groups compared to placebo. the latte trial caffeine to improve neurodevelopmental outcomes in infants born late preterm (the latte trial) is a phase iii multi-centre, parallel two-arm, double-blind, placebo-controlled randomised superiority trial of caffeine citrate in late preterm infants to improve the cognitive score at 2.5 years’ corrected age. the latte trial will assess the childhood outcomes of prophylactic enteral caffeine citrate administration in late preterm infants to provide robust evidence of the safety and efficacy of prophylactic caffeine citrate to improve neurodevelopment in late preterm infants. significance prophylactic enteral caffeine citrate is an accessible and economically viable intervention. if successful, this intervention has the potential to impact millions of late preterm infants worldwide [ 22 ]. given the prevalence of late preterm birth for māori, this has the potential to improve health and wellbeing for these infants and their whānau (extended families). though the latte dosage trial demonstrated an improvement in intermittent hypoxaemia and mean oxygen saturation, evidence of long-term neurodevelopmental benefits would provide further evidence for introducing this therapy routinely. objectives {7} to determine if prophylactic enteral caffeine citrate, given to infants born late preterm (34 + 0 to 36 + 6 weeks’ gestation) from birth to term postmenstrual age, improves neurodevelopmental outcome at 2.5 years’ corrected age. trial design {8} in this phase iii multi-centre, parallel two-arm, double-blind, placebo-controlled randomised superiority trial, eligible late preterm infants will be randomised online in a 1:1 ratio, to caffeine citrate or placebo, with stratification for study site groups, gestational age (34, 35 or 36 weeks) and ethnicity (māori or non-māori). methods: participants, interventions and outcomes study setting {9} infants will be recruited at secondary and tertiary maternity hospitals in aotearoa new zealand. they will be randomised and receive the loading dose of the study intervention while in hospital. once the infant is discharged home, the parents/caregivers will continue to give a daily dose of the study intervention until 40 +0 weeks postmenstrual age. at the time of submission for publication, the participating sites are: ◦ whangārei hospital ◦ north shore hospital ◦ waitakere hospital

parent/caregiver is able and willing to provide informed consent exclusion criteria: major congenital abnormality minor congenital abnormality likely to affect respiration, growth, or development previous caffeine treatment renal or hepatic impairment tachyarrhythmia seizures hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy maternal age less than 16 years more than 72 h after birth multiple births of triplets or higher who will take informed consent? {26a} parents/caregivers of eligible infants will be approached by a research nurse, research midwife, investigator, or neonatal clinical staff member in the first 72 h after birth as part of whakawhanaungatanga. parents/caregivers will receive written and verbal information about the trial, and any questions will be answered. parents/caregivers of participating infants will sign the informed consent form, and a copy will be provided to them. parents/caregivers are free to withdraw their infant from the trial at any time. the consent form includes an option to consent for information collected up to the point of withdrawal to continue to be processed. additional consent provisions for collection and use of participant data and biological specimens {26b} heart and mind sub-study the heart and mind sub-study will run concomitantly in selected centres. it has a separate protocol and will be reported separately. this sub-study will investigate cerebral blood flow and oxygenation following administration of the study intervention in up to 90 infants. these infants will undergo additional pulse oximetry, near infra-red spectroscopy, blood pressure and respiratory rate measurement, ultrasound and blood testing at baseline, after the loading dose and on day 5. consent to participate in this sub-study is provided in an optional section on the informed consent form. māori data sovereignty data collaborations with other researchers will only be considered if certain principles are met. these include that rightsholders and stakeholders in the study, especially māori, are consulted and engaged in the use and interpretation of study data; the use of study data upholds and is respectful of māori knowledge, worldviews and self-determination; patients are likely to derive benefit from the use of study data, including promotion of equitable outcomes; communities are not stigmatized or portrayed in terms of deficits, and a strengths-based lens is applied; and that the use of study data aligns with aotearoa new zealand ethical and māori data sovereignty frameworks and standards [ 12 , 23 , 24 ]. this process will be overseen collectively by the māori members of the trial steering committee. all participants are informed of the māori data sovereignty policy in the participant information sheet and are given the choice to consent for anonymised study data to be shared with approved researchers on the informed consent form. if this consent is not provided, data for these participants will not be shared with external researchers. interventions explanation for the choice of comparators {6b} the control intervention will be a placebo. at present, no prophylactic intervention is used routinely in late preterm infants to reduce intermittent hypoxemia or improve neurodevelopmental outcomes [ 16 ], so a placebo was considered appropriate. the placebo is the suspension vehicle used for the caffeine intervention, thus ensuring that the interventions have an identical appearance. the placebo will be given at an equivalent volume to the active intervention to preserve blinding. intervention description {11a} in the latte dosage trial, enteral caffeine citrate had a statistically significant effect, compared with placebo, on reducing the frequency of intermittent hypoxaemia at daily maintenance doses of 10 mg.kg −1 and 20 mg.kg −1 , but not at 15 mg.kg −1 [ 20 ]. the latte dosage trial recommended that future trials should consider using a 20 mg.kg −1 dose of caffeine citrate in late preterm infants due to a larger effect size in all respiratory measures and similar drug tolerability for the 20 mg.kg −1 dose compared to 10 mg.kg −1 . based on the findings of this study, a 40 mg.kg −1 loading dose followed by 20 mg.kg –1 day −1 maintenance until 40 +0 weeks’ postmenstrual age was chosen as the active intervention for the current trial. the latte dosage trial reported that when caffeine citrate was formulated in water, it was bitter at higher concentrations and difficult to administer orally in some late preterm infants [ 20 ]. therefore, for the current trial, the active intervention was formulated in a paediatric suspension vehicle, which contains sucrose and cherry flavouring (biomed ltd, auckland, aotearoa new zealand). the concentration of the active intervention is caffeine citrate 20 mg.ml −1 . infants will be given a 2 ml.kg −1 enteral loading dose of the study intervention (40 mg.kg −1 of caffeine citrate in the active intervention). the loading dose will be given prior to the infant reaching 96 h of age, followed by a daily dose of 1 ml.kg −1 each morning (20 mg.kg −1 of caffeine citrate in the active intervention) until 40 +0 weeks’ postmenstrual age. the dose will be recalculated at 3 weeks after randomisation for weight gain. two bottles of the study intervention from the same allocated group will be allocated at randomisation. the first bottle will be used for the first 3 weeks, and then returned to the study centre to determine compliance. the second bottle will be used after the first 3 weeks. the study intervention is given via a nasogastric tube for infants with a tube in situ, and orally for infants who do not require a nasogastric tube. infants who are not able to tolerate enteral medications will have the study intervention withheld until tolerance improves. criteria for discontinuing or modifying allocated interventions {11b} the dose of the study intervention may be reduced from 1 ml.kg −1 .day −1 (20 mg.kg −1 .day −1 caffeine citrate in the active intervention) to 0.5 ml.kg −1 .day −1 (10 mg.kg −1 .day −1 caffeine citrate in the active intervention) if the infant has tachycardia (heart rate consistently &gt; 180 beats per minute at rest) or if the parents/caregivers or clinicians believe the infant has side effects (at the discretion of the site lead investigator). if the parents/caregivers report difficulty administering the full volume, this can be administered as two half doses in the morning, e.g. with two separate feeds. the allocated intervention can be stopped at any time at the request of the parents/caregivers, or by the clinician caring for the infant if they believe that stopping the intervention would be in the best interest of the infant. if the intervention is stopped due to an acute illness or problem that resolves, consideration will be given to restarting the allocated intervention. infants should continue in the study and complete all planned assessments, regardless of adherence to the intervention, unless they are formally withdrawn from the study. outcome data collected up to the point of withdrawal will be reported (with consent). strategies to improve adherence to interventions {11c} where infants remain as inpatients, the study intervention will be charted on the inpatient medication chart to ensure it is given daily by, or under the supervision of, nursing or midwifery staff. the study team will ensure that the parents/caregivers feel comfortable administering the study intervention prior to discharge home. parents/caregivers will have the study team’s contact details to communicate any questions or concerns at any time after discharge home. the first bottle of study intervention will be collected at 3 weeks post randomisation (by courier if the infant has been discharged home), and the amount of study intervention remaining in the bottle will be determined. compliance will be defined as ≥ 80% of the predicted volume of the intervention dispensed. the study team will call the parents/caregivers at 3 weeks post randomisation to arrange the return of the first study bottle, weight-adjust the dose, and provide a reminder to continue the study intervention. they will then call at 40 +0 weeks’ postmenstrual age to remind parents/caregivers to cease the study intervention. relevant concomitant care permitted or prohibited during the trial {11d} all clinical care, other than study interventions and assessments, will be determined by the local clinical team, according to local guidelines. clinicians will be encouraged to use oxygen as first-line treatment for persistent hypoxaemia and positive pressure ventilation for apnoea or intermittent hypoxaemia. if necessary, clinicians can give a loading dose of caffeine citrate as an open-label medication. if a clinician decides to continue open-label caffeine treatment, the latte trial study intervention will be withheld until the open-label caffeine has been stopped. use of open-label caffeine treatment will be recorded. the trial analysis will be according to the allocated intervention group, regardless of any use of open-label caffeine. provisions for post-trial care {30} at the conclusion of early childhood follow up, parents/caregivers of children who have taken part in the study will be sent a letter summarising the results of the assessments, with information about who to contact if they have any questions. if there are concerns about a child’s health or developmental status, referral to an appropriate health agency, usually the child’s primary health provider, will be made with the consent of the parents/caregivers. parents, caregivers, and their health professionals will have the opportunity to request a more detailed report of specific assessment results if required. outcomes {12} primary outcome: mean bayley scales of infant development 4th edition (bsid iv) cognitive standard score at 2.5 years’ corrected age. main secondary outcomes: the following secondary outcomes at 2.5 years’ corrected age are considered critical in evaluating the study hypothesis: 1. cognitive delay (proportion with bsid iv cognitive standard score more than one standard deviation (sd) below the test mean, &lt; 85) 2. mean bsid iv language standard score 3. language delay (proportion with bsid iv language standard score more than one sd below the test mean, &lt; 85) 4. mean bsid iv motor standard score 5. motor delay (proportion with bsid iv motor standard score more than one sd below the mean, &lt; 85) 6. social-emotional/behavioural delay (proportion with bsid iv social-emotional score or bsid iv adaptive behaviour score more than one sd below the mean, &lt; 85) additional secondary outcomes: the following additional secondary outcomes will be reported to complement the evaluation of the active intervention: safety 1. proportion of participants who have died before 2.5 years’ corrected age 2. proportion of participants for whom the study intervention dose was reduced or discontinued due to side effects or poor tolerance of the intervention 3. proportion of participants who had tachycardia requiring dose reduction during the intervention period neonatal 4. mean weight, and weight z-score at 40 +0 weeks’ postmenstrual age 5. mean length of stay in hospital during the primary neonatal admission 6. proportion of participants fully breastfeeding at 40 +0 weeks’ postmenstrual age (the infant has taken breast milk only, no other liquids or solids except a minimal amount of water or prescribed medicines, in the past 48 h) early childhood outcomes at 2.5 years’ corrected age 7. moderate-severe cognitive delay (proportion with bsid iv cognitive standard score more than two sd below the test mean, &lt; 70). 8. moderate-severe language delay (proportion with bsid iv language standard score more than two sd below the test mean, &lt; 70). 9. moderate-severe motor delay (proportion with bsid iv motor standard score more than two sd below the test mean, &lt; 70). 10. developmental delay (proportion with bsid iv cognitive, language or motor standard score more than one sd below the test mean, &lt; 85). 11. high risk of school-age asthma (proportion with predicating asthma risk in childhood (parc) score ≥ 5) [ 25 ]. 12. asthma/wheeze (proportion with wheeze or whistling in the chest in the past 12 months or doctor diagnosed asthma (yes to parc #1/international study of asthma and allergy in childhood (isaac,[ 26 ]) #3 or isaac #7–8 questions)). 13. anthropometry (mean weight, height, head circumference and body mass index z -scores). 14. mean infant and toddler quality of life score (itqol). 15. healthcare utilisation after primary hospital discharge (linkage to routine data from the aotearoa new zealand ministry of health manatū hauora for emergency department visits, outpatient visits and hospitalisations, and parent questions on visits to primary healthcare providers). healthcare utilisation will be reported separately as a component of the health economic evaluation (see {20b}). participant timeline {13} the participant timeline is shown in fig. 1 . fig. 1 schedule of enrolment, interventions and assessments full size image sample size {14} a recent publication found that late preterm infants have a bsid cognitive score 5.3 points lower than term infants, equivalent to approximately one-third of a sd (sd 15) [ 27 ]. to detect a difference in bsid iv cognitive standard score between caffeine and placebo groups of at least 5 points with 90% power (two-sided α = 0.05) requires 191 infants in each arm (total 382). allowing for a conservative 20% drop-out rate (withdrawal and loss to follow-up), we will recruit a total of 478 infants (239 in each arm). infants from a multiple pregnancy may be recruited and will be allocated to the same intervention to avoid accidental cross-over. only one infant from a multiple pregnancy will be counted in the sample size, but all enrolled infants will be included in the modified intention-to-treat analysis. assuming a similar proportion of multiple births to that seen in the latte dosage trial ([ 20 ] ; the average number of infants per mother = 1.065), we expect to include a total of 510 infants if we achieve our target sample size of 478. we will place an emphasis on recruiting māori whānau in this study to assist mana whakamārama (equal explanatory power) to occur. to incorporate this principle, we will aim to recruit equal numbers of māori and non-māori infants. recruitment {15} late preterm infants make up at least 4.3% of births in aotearoa new zealand, or approximately 3000 cases annually [ 3 , 4 ]. the inclusion and exclusion criteria mean that most late preterm infants born at trial sites would be eligible for the latte trial. at time of publication, the five largest tertiary hospital birthing centres in aotearoa new zealand had commenced recruitment [ 4 ]. given that māori make up to 20% of the preterm population, strategies to enhance māori recruitment and retention include an intentional focus on whakawhanaungatanga with parents/caregivers approached by a research nurse/midwife, investigator or māori advisor antenatally or in the early postnatal period to discuss the trial; involvement of whānau and offering of kai (food) and koha (gift or contribution) at trial entry and follow-up visits where appropriate [ 28 ]. assignment of interventions: allocation sequence generation {16a} the allocation sequence will be generated by the study statistician, with stratification for centre (auckland city hospital, kidz first hospital, waikato hospital, dunedin hospital, north island special care baby units and south island special care baby units), gestational length (34, 35 or 36 weeks’ completed gestation) and ethnicity (māori or non-māori). infants from a multiple pregnancy will be allocated to the same study intervention due to the risk of intervention cross-over. concealment mechanism {16b} infants will be assigned randomly via an internet randomisation service to the placebo or caffeine citrate intervention with equal allocation ratio (1:1) according to the generated allocation sequence. only the study statistician, data manager and compounding pharmacy team will have access to the allocation sequence during the trial. personnel with access to the allocation sequence will not be involved in the recruitment of participants, provision of the intervention or outcome assessment. implementation {16c} study personnel or neonatal clinical staff will enrol participants and perform randomisation. at randomisation, the infant will be assigned a unique study identification number and will be allocated a study intervention pack labelled with a random number. the intervention pack will contain two bottles of the appropriate intervention, identified only by the intervention pack random number. only the data manager and compounding pharmacy team will know whether the intervention pack contains the active or control intervention. the infant’s hospital sticker will be applied to the bottles, and the intervention will only be dispensed to that infant. assignment of interventions: blinding who will be blinded {17a} the research team (investigators, coordinator, students, research staff), clinical staff and the infant’s parents/caregivers will be blinded to intervention allocation. this will be achieved by dispensing the intervention in identical bottles containing identical appearing solutions (caffeine and placebo) and labelled with a random number. only the data manager, study statistician and the compounding pharmacy team will have access to the allocation sequence during the trial, and only the data manager and compounding pharmacy team will know the contents of the study bottles. the data manager, study statistician and the compounding pharmacy team will have no direct contact with participants. procedure for unblinding if needed {17b} the clinical team caring for the infant may be unblinded if they consider it necessary for the provision of appropriate clinical care. this decision will be made in conjunction with the site lead investigator. in such an instance, the site lead investigator will contact the data manager and ask them to contact the responsible clinician with the study allocation. study personnel performing outcome assessments will remain blinded at all times. data collection and management plans for assessment and collection of outcomes {18a} the following baseline demographic and contact data will be collected at enrolment from parents/caregivers or the infant’s medical record: infant sex infant ethnicity, including hapū and iwi for māori participants (self-reported by parents/caregivers) [ 29 ] estimated date of birth (for calculating corrected age) infant date of birth birthweight customised birthweight centile [ 30 ] birth length birth head circumference maternal height and weight maternal age and parity pregnancy complications: gestational diabetes, pregestational diabetes, pre-eclampsia, antenatally diagnosed foetal growth restriction, smoking and drug use in pregnancy, antenatal corticosteroid administration, preterm prelabour rupture of membranes, induction of labour, mode of birth, place of birth, 5-min apgar score current respiratory support contact information, including social media, for the parents/caregivers, another close friend or relative, and primary care practitioner. the following data will be collected in the neonatal phase from parents/caregivers, the infant’s medical record or measurements conducted by study personnel: secondary outcomes listed in {12} date and time of loading dose administration neonatal care before and after randomisation: admission to neonatal or special baby care and reason for admission, respiratory support type and duration, apnoea, hypoglycaemia and severity, bacterial infection, date and time of admission and discharge from neonatal or special baby care heart/pulse rate at 1 week (3–8 days) post-randomisation or pre-discharge (whichever occurs first, but at least 72 h after randomisation) date of primary hospital discharge to calculate length of hospital stay for primary neonatal admission concurrent medications taken while the infant is receiving the study intervention weight at 3 weeks post-randomisation to calculate dose adjustment weight of returned bottle of study intervention to calculate compliance the following data will be collected in the early childhood phase from parents/caregivers or assessments conducted by study personnel: primary and secondary outcomes listed in {12} the following safety data will be collected from parents/caregivers, the infant’s medical record or measurements conducted by study personnel: death before 2.5 years’ corrected age (serious adverse event) tachycardia requiring dose reduction during the intervention period study intervention dose reduced or discontinued due to side effects or poor tolerance of the intervention any other adverse event that is considered serious (defined as immediately life-threatening; requires substantial prolongation of existing hospitalisation or escalation in care, or results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity) the following derived variables will be calculated at analysis: socioeconomic decile will be determined from the new zealand deprivation index [ 31 ], calculated from the mother’s address at trial entry gestation and sex-specific z -scores for weight, length and head circumference at birth, and weight z -score at term equivalent age will be calculated using the fenton population reference [ 32 ] age and sex-specific z -scores at 2.5 years’ corrected age for weight, length, bmi, and head circumference will be calculated using the who child growth standards [ 33 ] customised birthweight centiles will be converted to z -scores under the normal distribution baseline demographic, contact data and neonatal data will be recorded by study personnel who have been trained in the use of the study data management systems and data dictionary. early-childhood outcome assessment and recording of data will be conducted by assessors who will be trained in administering and scoring the bsid iv and performing anthropometry for the 2.5-year assessments. all bsid scoring will be performed using an electronic calculator based on age from the estimated date of birth (best obstetric estimate). early-childhood outcome assessors will be trained in the use of the study data management systems and data dictionary. parent questionnaires will be administered online around the time of the early-childhood assessment using the redcap system survey function. hard copy questionnaires will be available if internet access is not available. if questionnaires are completed on paper, the data will be entered into the redcap system by study personnel as soon as possible. support will be offered to parents/caregivers where questionnaires are not in their first language or when lower literacy may make completion of questionnaires difficult. the bsid iv is a structured assessment of cognitive, language and motor development for children up to 42 months. it is performed by a trained assessor, plus scales assessing social-emotional and adaptive behaviour, administered via caregiver questionnaire. it provides norm-referenced scores standardised in the australian and new zealand population. normative standard scores for the bsid iv cognitive, language and motor domains have a mean of 100 and a sd of 15. if a child is unable to complete testing in a domain due to disability or impairment, a score of 2 sd below the mean will be assigned. bsid iv scores are consistent with the bayley-iii, wechsler preschool and primary scale of intelligence and the peabody developmental motor scales [ 34 ]. cognitive scores at 2.5 years’ corrected age have a moderate to high positive correlation with later intelligence quotient, and, of all early developmental domains, cognitive scores are the most predictive of later neurodevelopmental outcomes [ 35 , 36 , 37 ]. the bayley adaptive behaviour and social-emotional scales are parent questionnaires, based on the vineland adaptive behaviour scales third edition and the greenspan social-emotional scales questionnaire for infants and young children, respectively [ 38 ]. at 18–24 months, bsid scale scores are correlated with intelligence and behaviour at school age [ 39 ]. the parc is a 10-item questionnaire focussing on wheezing and related symptoms and risk factors that has been validated for predicting childhood asthma [ 40 ]. the itqol short form assesses parent-reported general health and health-related quality of life based on 47 items that are combined into a transformed scale from 0 (worst health) to 100 (best health) and has been reported to be a reliable and valid alternative to the 97-item itqol [ 41 ]. plans to promote participant retention and complete follow-up {18b} infants will continue in the study and complete all planned assessments, regardless of adherence to the intervention, unless they are formally withdrawn from the study. if the study intervention is ceased temporarily, such as during an acute illness or problem that resolves, consideration will be given to restarting the study intervention. we will contact infants’ parents/caregivers with yearly birthday cards, which include a reminder to update changing contact details. we will trace families for whom current contact information is not available via their primary health provider, midwife or other family members. the trial’s focus on whakawhanaungatanga with parents/caregivers will support retention and tracing. all infants born in aotearoa new zealand are allocated a national health index (nhi) number at birth (national medical record number, mrn). they are entered into a national nhi database, which records contact information and is updated at each contact with secondary or tertiary care. the nhi will be recorded and can be used for tracing participants, if required. a koha will be given to participants at enrolment and 2.5-year follow-up. data management {19} data will be collected directly into ecrfs or electronic surveys using the redcap system. branching logic and range checks will be used to reduce data entry errors. hard copy forms will be available if internet access is not available, and data will be transferred to the redcap system as soon as possible. a data monitor will review each ecrf and survey for completeness before locking forms. if needed, queries will be raised with the site research team and tracked in redcap. a data management plan has been developed to complement the trial protocol, which is available upon request. confidentiality {27} the redcap system will run on amazon web services web and database cloud servers located in sydney, australia, with configuration and security operated by the medical research institute of new zealand. the trial steering group acknowledges that hosting indigenous data on aotearoa new zealand servers would be preferable; however, an appropriate service was not identified prior to trial commencement. web access will be controlled by unique user identification and password, two-factor authentication and user-level privileges, with a full electronic audit trail. participant privacy will be enhanced by the use of three separate redcap projects. project one will store screening data, including infant and maternal nhi/mrn and date of birth (to calculate chronological age); expected date of delivery (to calculate gestation length); infant birthweight, sex and ethnicity; and eligibility criteria. this will enable the reporting of consort data and assessment of external validity. records in project one will be labelled with a unique screening number to allow anonymisation of screening data for non-randomised infants at the completion of the study. project one will also support electronic consent (if eligible); randomisation (if eligible and consented); generate a unique study identification number at randomisation; and allocate intervention packs. following randomisation, records will be created automatically in projects two and three. project two will store baseline data, primary and secondary outcomes, safety data, survey data and sub-study data. records in project two will be identified only by the study identification number. project two will contain no identifiable data other than dates that are essential for calculations. project three will store contact information and identifiable data. records in project three will be identified by the unique study number and will contain nhi/mrn. data access groups will be employed so that site personnel can only see data for participants at their site. the download of data will be restricted to the data manager, study coordinator, principal investigator and study statistician, and only the data manager and principal investigator will be able to download identifiers. extracted data files will contain the indirect identifiers date of birth and estimated date of delivery, as these are necessary for analysis. no direct identifiers such as nhi/mrn, name, or address will be combined with study outcome data. study reports will contain only summary data, and individual participant data will not be reported. identifiers will not be released to any third party. research staff will be certified in best practice for clinical trials. at the completion of the study, deidentified study data will be permanently digitally archived with the university of auckland research data storage services in aotearoa new zealand. a digital reidentification key will be stored separate from the study data and will be accessible only to the senior investigators and head of department, or their representatives. plans for collection, laboratory evaluation and storage of biological specimens for genetic or molecular analysis in this trial/future use {33} blood gas samples for the heart and mind sub-study will be processed immediately. no biological samples will be stored for future analysis or use. statistical methods statistical methods for primary and secondary outcomes {20a} a detailed statistical analysis plan will be finalised and will be made publicly available prior to database lock. the primary analysis will compare primary and secondary outcomes between the placebo and caffeine groups using generalised mixed models with adjustment for the variables used in stratification (centre, gestational age at birth (continuous) and ethnicity (māori or non-māori)); potential confounding by socio-economic status (new zealand deprivation index) and infant sex; and non-independence of multiples (random effect). intervention effects will be presented as mean difference, ratio of geometric means (positively skewed data) or risk difference with 95% confidence interval. for categorical data, an estimate of relative effect will also be given (odds ratio, 95% confidence interval). a hypothesis test will be conducted for the primary outcome (two-tailed α = 0.05). missing data will not be imputed in the primary analysis. the primary analysis will use a modified intention-to-treat approach, which will exclude infants who are (i) randomised in error, i.e. are ineligible; or (ii) withdrawn by parents/caregivers prior to the collection of any outcome data. randomisation errors are expected to be uncommon due to the use of electronic screening and consenting procedures that are linked to the randomisation system. infants will be included in the primary analysis regardless of adherence to the intervention. a complete-case analysis approach will be used in the primary analysis. co-variates for primary analysis are collected at trial entry and missing data are expected to be rare. interim analyses {21b} there is no planned interim efficacy analysis, as it is anticipated that most of the trial sample will have been recruited prior to assessment of the primary outcome at 2.5 years’ corrected age. the data monitoring committee will review safety outcomes annually by masked intervention group. these include death before 2.5 years’ corrected age; tachycardia requiring dose reduction during the intervention period; study intervention dose reduction or discontinuation due to side effects or poor tolerance of the intervention; and other adverse events that are considered serious. based on safety data, the data monitoring committee will advise the trial steering committee if any amendments to the protocol or study procedures should be considered. methods for additional analyses (e.g. subgroup analyses) {20b} secondary analyses will be performed for the primary and critical secondary outcomes, including: 1. sensitivity analysis: compliance: excluding infants who were non-compliant with the study intervention (&lt; 80% of expected volume removed from the first bottle returned at 3 weeks post-randomisation) open label caffeine treatment: excluding infants who received open label caffeine neurological conditions: excluding participants with developmental delay due to conditions unrelated to preterm birth and caffeine therapy, e.g. traumatic brain injury, genetic disorders, and congenital brain malformations 2. imputation analysis: multiple imputation techniques may be considered if there are concerns about bias in effect estimates due to differential loss to follow-up among groups, especially if this is related to prognostic factors 3. subgroup analysis: ethnicity (māori, non-māori) sex (female, male) 4. economic evaluation (to be considered if caffeine citrate is effective at improving outcomes): cost of the caffeine citrate intervention : this will be estimated by quantifying the additional cost associated with consumables required for neonatal intervention (i.e. the total amount of caffeine citrate used) using a resource-based approach. health care service utilisation costs: a self-reported service use questionnaire will be used at follow-up to document health utilisation and costs (e.g. number of hospital days a patient was on a specific mode of respiratory support; emergency department, primary healthcare and therapy visit costs, other health service utilisation costs and surgical procedures; hospital admissions after the initial discharge; and the use of home oxygen) among participants. self-reported service use will be supplemented by electronic administrative data (i.e. the national minimum data set for hospital admissions) obtained with consent. this will use a resource-based costing approach that measures the inputs required to deliver a service (e.g. identify provision of care/number of visits) and applying market prices to each of these resources (e.g. cost/hour for healthcare visit). unit costs will be sourced from published aotearoa new zealand data (where available), and where they are unavailable, published international data (once its applicability to aotearoa new zealand’s context is thoroughly assessed) or local estimates. costs will be measured in current aotearoa new zealand dollars. economic and cost-effectiveness analysis: from a healthcare funder perspective, cost analysis will include direct healthcare costs (i.e. healthcare services, prescription charges), indirect costs (e.g. loss of caregiver productivity, caregiver missed days of work), and out-of-pocket expenses associated with the intervention. a cost-effectiveness analysis will be conducted under the consolidated health economic evaluation reporting guidelines [ 42 ] to examine caffeine citrate treatment’s likely impact on improving neurodevelopmental outcomes in the aotearoa new zealand context. an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio will be calculated to compare additional costs and health benefits associated with the caffeine citrate compared with control as a cost per survivor without neurodevelopment impairment (as measured by bsid iv) [ 43 ]. methods in analysis to handle protocol non-adherence and any statistical methods to handle missing data {20c} the primary analysis will be based on a modified intention-to-treat approach, as defined above {20a}. the analysis data set for the main report will include all participants with at least one primary or secondary outcome. if participants meet the modified intention-to-treat criteria but do not have any outcome data, their baseline characteristics will be described. multiple imputation methods may be considered in secondary analysis to address missing data. plans to give access to the full protocol, participant-level data and statistical code {31c} information regarding the trial is available to the public on the australian new zealand clinical trials registry https://www.anzctr.org.au/trial/registration/trialreview.aspx?id=384799&amp;isreview=true . statistical code and deidentified participant level data of consenting participants will be available after publication, on application, where the purpose meets aotearoa new zealand ethical standards and the trial’s māori data sovereignty policy as detailed in {26b}. oversight and monitoring composition of the coordinating centre and trial steering committee {5d} each trial site has a site lead investigator (usually a neonatal or general paediatrician) to provide day-to-day guidance and liaise with the trial steering committee. the trial steering committee, chaired by the principal investigator (jane alsweiler) is comprised of neonatologists and a respiratory paediatrician experienced in running large, randomised trials; māori academics; a statistician; and a paediatric pharmacist. they meet approximately quarterly or more often as required to discuss operational issues such as recruitment, compliance and adverse effects. the trial steering committee will be responsible for overseeing the publication of trial results in an accurate and timely manner at the conclusion of trial follow-up. composition of the data monitoring committee, its role and reporting structure {21a} the data monitoring committee has four independent members, including the chair, a paediatrician experienced in large, randomised trials; a neonatologist; a statistician; and a māori respiratory paediatrician. the data monitoring committee convened prior to the first randomisation to review the trial protocol and the terms of reference. the data monitoring committee is advisory to the trial steering committee, providing feedback to the principal investigator regarding any recommendations or concerns. the data monitoring committee will monitor recruitment, sample size assumptions, completeness of data acquisition, and evidence for group differences in the safety outcome measures. the data monitoring committee will convene yearly to advise the trial steering committee on trial continuation or protocol modification. once the intervention phase has finished, the data monitoring committee will remain an advisory body until publication. serious adverse events (death before 2.5 years corrected age or other as defined in {18a}) will be reported to the data monitoring committee within 48 h by the site primary investigator; adverse events will be reported at yearly intervals. data monitoring committee: ◦ professor stuart dalziel (chair) auckland, aotearoa new zealand ◦ associate professor kathryn beardsall (independent expert) cambridge, united kingdom ◦ associate professor greg gamble (independent statistician) auckland, aotearoa new zealand ◦ associate professor catherine a. byrnes (ngāti raukawa-ki-te-tonga; independent expert) auckland, aotearoa new zealand adverse event reporting and harms {22} the following serious adverse events and adverse events will be reported to the data monitoring committee: serious adverse events (reported spontaneously to the data monitoring committee within 48 h of the site primary investigator being notified): death before 2.5 years’ corrected age other serious adverse event (defined as immediately life-threatening; requires prolongation of existing hospitalisation or substantial escalation in care, or results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity) adverse events (systematically recorded in ecrfs and reported to the data monitoring committee annually): tachycardia requiring dose reduction during the intervention period study intervention dose reduced or discontinued due to side effects or poor tolerance of the intervention death before 2.5 years’ corrected age, tachycardia requiring dose reduction during the intervention period, and study intervention dose reduced or discontinued due to side effects or poor tolerance of the intervention are specified secondary outcomes recorded systematically for all participants and will be reported in the trial publication. if deemed trial related by the dmc, other serious adverse events will be reported in the trial publication using the neonatal adverse event severity scale framework [ 44 ]. frequency and plans for auditing trial conduct {23} data entry will be continuously audited for accuracy and completeness. protocol deviations, adverse effects, and recruitment will be audited periodically at the regular trial steering committee meetings. plans for communicating important protocol amendments to relevant parties (e.g. trial participants, ethical committees) {25} there have not been any major changes to the trial protocol since the trial began. minor changes and additions sought by the trial steering committee will be submitted for approval to relevant ethics committees, and then distributed and communicated to each participating site. dissemination plans {31a} results will be communicated to those parents/caregivers who requested to receive a trial report on the consent form. this will be sent via email and using lay language. results will also be disseminated back to māori communities. the results of the trial will be presented at national and international conferences and will be published in high-impact medical journals. media and social media opportunities will be sought to communicate the results to the public. discussion enteral caffeine citrate is a simple intervention that may improve developmental outcomes in the large cohort of infants born late preterm. the latte trial is a phase iii multi-centre, parallel two-arm, double-blind, placebo-controlled randomised superiority trial, which is powered to detect important differences in cognitive outcome at 2.5 years’ corrected age, the early developmental domain most predictive of later neurodevelopmental outcome. while it is promising that caffeine citrate reduces intermittent hypoxaemia in late preterm infants, assessment of meaningful longer-term outcomes will provide convincing evidence for the implementation of routine caffeine prophylaxis for all late preterm infants if it proves to be beneficial. this trial has taken an intentional approach to incorporating māori principles in trial design and promoting indigenous recruitment, data governance and data sovereignty, in order to pursue improved outcomes for indigenous peoples. trial status the current protocol is version number 1.3, dated 14/06/2024. recruitment commenced in may 2023 at kidz first hospital, auckland, with additional sites added over time. recruitment is expected to be completed in late 2025, with results available in 2028. data availability {29} applications to obtain study data may be made to the principal investigator and will be at the discretion of the trial steering committee. anonymised individual patient study data may be made available to researchers through a mediated process to ensure that aotearoa new zealand ethical standards and māori data sovereignty framework are upheld, as further detailed in {26b}. model consent forms, ecrf templates and the statistical analysis plan will be available on request. abbreviations spo 2 : peripheral oxygen saturation bsid iv: bayley scales of infant development 4th edition sd: standard deviation parc:
