## Abstract

Congenital hypothyroidism (CH) is a prevalent condition that can lead to significant neurodevelopmental issues in infants if not diagnosed and treated promptly. Van Wyk and Grumbach Syndrome (VWGS), characterized by hypothyroidism, precocious puberty, and ovarian masses, is often misdiagnosed in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) due to limited diagnostic resources. This case highlights systemic challenges, including delayed diagnosis and unnecessary surgical referrals.We present an 8-year-old girl diagnosed with Van Wyk-Grumbach syndrome, characterized by severe hypothyroidism, isosexual precocious puberty, and ovarian hyperstimulation. She exhibited symptoms including vaginal bleeding, abdominal distention, and marked obesity with stunted growth. Investigations revealed severe hypothyroidism (TSH: 96 mU/L) and enlarged bilateral ovarian cysts. After initiating levothyroxine therapy, the patient demonstrated remarkable clinical improvement, including reduced abdominal swelling and normalizing thyroid function. This case underscores the importance of considering hypothyroidism in differential diagnoses of ovarian masses in children, especially in regions lacking newborn screening protocols, to prevent unnecessary surgical interventions and ensure appropriate management of the condition.

## Introduction

Congenital hypothyroidism (CH) is a condition that affects infants from birth (congenital) and results from partial or complete loss of thyroid function. It is common and can cause severe neurodevelopmental morbidity. Prompt diagnosis and treatment are critical to optimizing long-term outcomes [1]. Careful evaluation will usually reveal the etiology of congenital hypothyroidism, which may inform treatment and prognosis [1].Prolonged hypothyroidism in children commonly causes short stature with delayed bone maturation, and delayed puberty. However, a paradoxical occurrence of peripheral precocious puberty and pituitary enlargement in chronically untreated juvenile hypothyroidism was first reported by Van Wyk and Grumbach in 1960 [2]. Van Wyk-Grumbach syndrome refers to the development of isosexual precocious puberity and multicystic enlarged ovaries in the presence of hypothyroidism and delayed bone age. It is a rare presentation of untreated hypothyroidism. The prepubertal response in Van Wyk-Grumbach syndrome is always isosexual and mediated by very high thyroid-stimulating hormone levels acting through the follicle-stimulating hormone receptors inducing a follicle-stimulating hormonal effect [3]. Severe hypothyroidism can affect a variety of organs and can develop atypical manifestations. Peripheral precocious puberty may be secondary to other endocrinological diseases, which must be taken into account in the differential diagnosis in order to avoid unnecessary additional tests [4]. VWGS is frequently misdiagnosed as malignancy in LMICs due to limited access to hormonal assays and imaging expertise [4]. This case from rural Ethiopia illustrates how systemic gaps—including fragmented health systems, diagnostic resource shortages, and socioeconomic barriers—compound patient harm.

## Case presentation

HistoryThis 8 years old child who is the third for her family presented complaining vaginal bleeding for a week period which was bright red copious amount initially and became scanty later. Parents reported that she was having progressive abdominal distention for about 5 months with rapid weight gain despite having no change on dietary habit. She didn’t enrolled to school as of her age which was due to her slow development. No history of trauma, child abuse or vaginal foreign body. Parents didn’t notice hematuria, hematochezia or melena. This child referred to our paediatric surgical clinic for evaluation of cystic abdominopelvic mass. Otherwise the child feeds well passes stool every 3rd day and very quit and calm among the siblings.Developmental and Social History

Developmental Delay: Unable to read/write, with speech limited to simple sentences.


Neonatal Screening: Unavailable in her region.

Physical examination

Vital signs are all in normal range for her age.


Anthropometry: Height 108 cm (−3.2 SDS), weight 25 kg (−2.8 SDS). BMI = 21.5 cm BMI for age puts the child in grade 1 obesity category. Interpretation of the anthropometry puts the child as severely stunted and grade 1 obese.


General Signs of Hypothyroidism: Puffy face, Macroglossia, dry skin, delayed deep tendon reflexes.


 No neck mass and sign of thyroid gland enlargement.


Abdomen/Pelvis: Abdomen was grossly distended with positive sign of fluid collection with ill defined abdominopelvic nontender palpable mass with unreachable lower border. Normal looking female external genitalia with no active bleeding. There was grade 2 pitting pedal and pretibial edema noted.

Diagnostic journeyThe child was investigated with biochemical tests showing haematocrit of 31.4% and haemoglobin of 11.8 g/dl. Liver function tests, renal functions tests and urine analysis all normal.

Hormonal Profile:


 TSH: 96 µIU/mL (normal: 0.4–4.0), free T4: <0.3 ng/dL (0.8–1.8). T3 = 0.6nmol/L(normal 1.8–2.8.8nmol/L) and T4 = 6nmol/L(83-172nmol/L).


LH: 0.1 IU/L, FSH: 4.2 IU/L (prepubertal < 0.6).


 Estradiol: 80.85 pg/mL (prepubertal < 10), prolactin: 36 ng/mL (normal < 20).


Imaging:


Wrist X-ray: Bone age 5 years (Greulich-Pyle atlas), with delayed carpal fusion (Fig. 1).

## Discussion

Van Wyk-Grumbach syndrome was first described in 1960 [4] as a syndrome of juvenile hypothyroidism associated with pubertal advancement. It is a rare clinical entity that presents with prolonged untreated hypothyroidism. Girls with Van Wyck-Grumbach syndrome [5] can have varying degrees of pubertal development as well as multicystic ovaries, vaginal bleeding, galactorrhea and delayed bone age. The etiology of Van Wyck-Grumbach syndrome is thought to be related to complex interactions within the hypothalamic-pituitary axis [5]. In a study by Anasti et al. [6], recombinant TSH interacted with FSH receptor to stimulate adenylyl cyclase activity. Recombinant TSH acted as a competitive inhibitor of FSH, indicating that TSH and FSH were acting through the FSH receptor. Increased FSH levels can result in ovarian hyperstimulation; hence, multicystic ovaries can be a feature of this syndrome as well [7]. Ovarian cysts may resolve after levothyroxine treatment, as was demonstrated in our patient.Hormonal paradoxes in VWGSSuppressed gonadotropins (LH/FSH)Precocious puberty in VWGS is driven by TSH-FSH receptor cross-reactivity, leading to estrogen secretion from ovarian cysts [10]. Elevated estrogen suppresses hypothalamic GnRH release, resulting in low LH/FSH levels—a hallmark distinguishing VWGS from central precocious puberty (CPP) [5]. In our patient, LH was undetectable (0.1 IU/L), aligning with prior reports [6].Elevated prolactinHypothyroidism increases thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH), which stimulates both TSH and prolactin secretion [7]. Prolactin levels > 25 ng/mL correlate strongly with severe hypothyroidism (TSH > 50 µIU/mL) [8], as seen here (prolactin 36 ng/mL).In a developing country like Ethiopia where there is no protocol of new-born screening for congenital hypothyroidism, children present late when they manifest alarming symptoms like vaginal bleeding and abdominal distention as it occurred in our case [11, 12]. Ovarian cysts in VWGS are often misclassified as neoplasms. A 2022 Ethiopian study found that 65% of pediatric ovarian masses underwent surgery, yet only 8% were malignant [14]. As a result the child sometimes undergo unnecessary surgical interventions. In our case, consideration of congenital hypothyroidism as a cause for the child’s symptom came last. It’s important to take whole picture of child development as all effect of hypothyroidism on child’s growth and development were there up on retrospective evaluation.Differentiating congenital hypothyroidism (CH) from acquired hypothyroidism (AH) in children involves evaluating clinical presentation, timing of onset, diagnostic findings, and underlying causes [12, 13].Congenital Hypothyroidism: Present at birth, typically identified via “newborn screening”(heel-prick test measuring TSH) [14]. Symptoms may appear within weeks if undiagnosed. Absent, hypoplastic, or ectopic gland (e.g., sublingual) are seen in CH.Acquired hypothyroidism on the other hand presents with fatigue, weight gain, cold intolerance, constipation. Growth retardation, delayed puberty, myxedema, goiter (common in Hashimoto’s). School performance decline or behavioral changes are some of the evidences [14, 15].

Thyroid scintigraphy (Tc-99 m or I-123): Confirms ectopic/absent gland in CH.


Newborn Screening: Critical for early CH diagnosis (repeat if ambiguous).

The treatment approach is clear in this condition. Surgery should only be considered for complications of ovarian cysts, such as torsion [9]. Almost all patients with VWGS respond well to thyroid replacement therapy [10]. Usually, ovarian enlargement resolves within 3 to 6 months of T4 therapy [8]. In our patient, the multi-cysts were monitored regularly by ultrasound and reduced in size at each assessment. She improved clinically, with resolution of abdominal distention and vaginal bleeding stopped with the child becoming more alert and lost weight subsequently.Children with precocious puberty due to other aetiologies are tall, have pubertal growth spurt and advanced bone age where as children with hypothyroidism are short statured, have delayed bone age and there is no concomitant growth spurt. Treatment of precocious puberty due to hypothyroidism is simply orally levothyroxine.

## Suppressed gonadotropins (LH/FSH)

Precocious puberty in VWGS is driven by TSH-FSH receptor cross-reactivity, leading to estrogen secretion from ovarian cysts [10]. Elevated estrogen suppresses hypothalamic GnRH release, resulting in low LH/FSH levels—a hallmark distinguishing VWGS from central precocious puberty (CPP) [5]. In our patient, LH was undetectable (0.1 IU/L), aligning with prior reports [6].

## Elevated prolactin

Hypothyroidism increases thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH), which stimulates both TSH and prolactin secretion [7]. Prolactin levels > 25 ng/mL correlate strongly with severe hypothyroidism (TSH > 50 µIU/mL) [8], as seen here (prolactin 36 ng/mL).
In a developing country like Ethiopia where there is no protocol of new-born screening for congenital hypothyroidism, children present late when they manifest alarming symptoms like vaginal bleeding and abdominal distention as it occurred in our case [11, 12]. Ovarian cysts in VWGS are often misclassified as neoplasms. A 2022 Ethiopian study found that 65% of pediatric ovarian masses underwent surgery, yet only 8% were malignant [14]. As a result the child sometimes undergo unnecessary surgical interventions. In our case, consideration of congenital hypothyroidism as a cause for the child’s symptom came last. It’s important to take whole picture of child development as all effect of hypothyroidism on child’s growth and development were there up on retrospective evaluation.

Congenital Hypothyroidism: Present at birth, typically identified via “newborn screening”(heel-prick test measuring TSH) [14]. Symptoms may appear within weeks if undiagnosed.

Treatment of precocious puberty due to hypothyroidism is simply orally levothyroxine.

## Conclusion

This case illustrates how VWGS in LMICs is exacerbated by delayed diagnosis, diagnostic resource shortages, and systemic inequities. Suppressed LH, elevated prolactin, and delayed bone age are critical diagnostic clues. Strengthening laboratory capacity, clinician education, and neonatal screening programs is essential to reduce unnecessary surgeries and improve outcomes. This case is the first from Ethiopia and it help to strongly remind health professionals to consider hypothyroidism as possible differential for ovarian mass in children with feature of precocious pseudopuberty.
