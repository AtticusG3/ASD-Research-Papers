## Abstract

Introduction
Klinefelter syndrome (KS) is a genetic condition characterised by the presence of an extra X chromosome in males (47,XXY). KS is associated with various phenotypic characteristics in adult life, including infertility, hypogonadism and increased risk of type II diabetes, cardiovascular disease and osteoporosis. Additionally, individuals with KS often experience mental health challenges and functional impairments that significantly impact their quality of life. Currently, testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) in adolescence is considered the first-line treatment by some physicians for patients with KS and biochemical signs of hypogonadism. However, comprehensive evidence on its effectiveness in preventing typical phenotypic traits associated with KS remains limited, and, currently, no evidence-based recommendations for TRT in this population exist. We therefore aim to evaluate the effects of two years of TRT during puberty in boys with KS. The primary endpoint is to monitor changes in body fat percentage. Secondary endpoints include changes in pubertal development and virilisation, growth and body proportions, bone mineralisation, muscle strength, lipid and glucose metabolism, systemic inflammation, methylation, fertility and effects on the cognitive and psychopathological features of KS.
