## Abstract

Brain development involves the sequential expression of vulnerable biological processes including cell proliferation, programmed cell death, neuronal migration, synapse and functional unit formation. All these processes involve gene and activity-dependent events that can be distorted by many extrinsic and intrinsic environmental factors, including stress, microbiota, inflammatory signals, hormonal signals and epigenetic factors, hence leading to disorders born in the womb that are manifested later in autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) and other neurodevelopmental disorders. Predicting and treating such disorders call for a conceptual framework that includes all aspects of developmental biology. Here, taking the high incidence of ASDs as an example, we first discuss the intrinsic limitations of the genetic approach, notably the widely used twin studies and SNPs. We then review the long list of in utero events that can deviate developmental sequences, leading to persistent aberrant activity generated by immature misplaced and misconnected neuronal ensembles that are the direct cause of ASD. In a clinical perspective, we suggest analysing non-genetic maternity data to enable an early prediction of babies who will develop ASD years later, thereby facilitating early psycho-educative techniques. Subsequently, agents capable of selectively silencing malformed immature networks offer promising therapeutic perspectives. In summary, understanding developmental processes is critical to predicting, understanding and treating ASD, as well as most other disorders that arise in the womb.
