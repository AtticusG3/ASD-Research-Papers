## Abstract

Testosterone deficiency (TD) is a clinically significant condition strongly associated with aging and metabolic syndrome. While previous studies have established links between muscle mass and TD, evidence regarding the relationship between muscle quality index (MQI) and TD remains limited. This study aimed to investigate the association between MQI and TD in adult males in the United States and to develop an interpretable machine learning (ML) model based on SHapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP) for predicting TD risk.
We conducted a cross-sectional study using weighted multivariate logistic regression and subgroup analysis to assess the association between MQI and TD. Six ML models incorporating MQI were developed to predict TD risk. Model performance was evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), confusion matrix, F1 score, Brier score, and precision-recall curve. The optimal model was selected based on these metrics and further interpreted using SHAP to elucidate feature importance and decision-making processes.
The study included 2,628 eligible male participants, with a TD prevalence of 25.76%. After adjusting for confounders, each unit increase in MQI was associated with a 52% reduction in TD risk (OR = 0.480, 95% CI: 0.362-0.636, P < 0.001), demonstrating a dose-response relationship. Among the six ML models, the Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LGBM) exhibited the best predictive performance, achieving an AUC of 0.746 (95% CI: 0.707-0.790). SHAP analysis revealed that body mass index (BMI) was the most influential feature in the LGBM model, followed by high-density lipoprotein and MQI. Notably, lower MQI values were consistently associated with a higher risk of TD.
Our findings indicate that MQI is an independent and reliable predictor of TD in males. The interpretable LGBM model provides a cost-effective and clinically applicable tool for early TD risk assessment. These results underscore the importance of muscle quality in testosterone regulation and may inform preventive strategies to mitigate TD risk in adult males.

## Background

Testosterone, a pivotal steroid hormone in male physiology, is predominantly synthesized by testicular Leydig cells, with minor contributions from adrenal cortical secretion. This hormone exerts pleiotropic effects, critically regulating the development and maintenance of secondary sexual characteristics, while also modulating key physiological processes including protein anabolism, bone mineral homeostasis, adipose tissue distribution, cardiovascular function, and renal physiology [1]. Testosterone deficiency (TD) is characterized by reduced serum androgen levels in adult males and is a clinically significant condition often associated with multi-system dysfunction. TD represents a globally prevalent endocrine disorder with significant age-dependent incidence patterns. Epidemiological studies demonstrate a progressive decline in serum testosterone levels beginning at approximately 40 years of age, with clinically significant hypogonadism affecting approximately 7% of men beyond 50 years [2]. Regional prevalence studies reveal substantial geographical variation, with reported rates of 38.7% in North American, 21.3% in European, and 42.76% in Chinese adult male populations [3]. While advanced age represents a well-established risk factor for TD, emerging evidence suggests a multifactorial etiology involving complex interrelationships with other pathological conditions. A combined analysis of National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data and Mendelian randomization studies has demonstrated a bidirectional association between TD and anemia [4]. Liu et al. demonstrated a bidirectional causal relationship between obesity and TD in males, further supported by a significant inverse linear correlation between the weight-adjusted waist circumference index and serum total testosterone levels [5]. Given the significant clinical implications of TD and its multifactorial etiology, rigorous investigation of TD and its associated risk factors represents a critical research priority for preserving and optimizing male health outcomes across the lifespan.Skeletal muscle constitutes approximately 40–50% of total body mass in adults and demonstrates a progressive age-related decline in males, with longitudinal studies reporting an annual reduction rate of 0.47% in muscle mass [6]. Importantly, this sarcopenic process is characterized by qualitative alterations in body composition rather than simple weight loss, as the diminished muscle tissue is frequently replaced by adipose infiltration, ultimately resulting in functional impairment. The muscle quality index (MQI), defined as muscle strength per unit of muscle mass, has been established as an emerging biomarker for assessing both systemic health status and physical functional capacity [7]. Wang Z et al. conducted a study on the relationship between MQI and the risk of depression in non-elderly American adults and confirmed that higher MQI levels are closely associated with a lower risk of depression in non-elderly American adults [8]. Tantai X et al. analyzed NHANES data and found that MQI was closely negatively correlated with the risk of advanced fibrosis in patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease [9]. Furthermore, the study by Wang C et al. showed that higher MQI was significantly associated with lower risk of arthritis, suggesting that maintaining muscle mass may be a key factor in preventing arthritis [10]. Recent evidence from multiple clinical studies indicates a significant physiological association between the maintenance of muscle mass in men and normal testosterone levels [11,12,13]. Nevertheless, the precise relationship between MQI and TD risk remains poorly characterized in current literature. To address this critical knowledge gap, we designed the present study to systematically evaluate the hypothesis that MQI serves as an independent predictor of TD in adult males.Current study on the association between MQI and disease outcomes remains primarily dependent on conventional analytical approaches that demonstrate limited computational efficacy for complex data processing [14]. These traditional methodologies predominantly employ rule-based algorithms, which are constrained to analyzing simplified, structured datasets and necessitate extensive manual preprocessing when handling incomplete or noisy variables. Machine learning (ML) has emerged as a transformative paradigm in predictive disease modeling. Compared to conventional analytical methods, ML techniques exhibit superior performance in contemporary data analysis, particularly when processing high-dimensional datasets characteristic of modern biomedical research [15]. However, while conventional ML algorithms demonstrate robust analytical capabilities, their clinical implementation is frequently hindered by inherent limitations in model interpretability [16]. The explainable ML framework addresses these key limitations in the following ways: transparent decision-making processes that reveal underlying prediction mechanisms; enhanced model credibility through explainable prediction rationale; systematic bias detection capabilities that aid model optimization; and improved clinical utility through actionable diagnostic insights [17]. This methodological breakthrough enables researchers to not only generate accurate predictions, but also understand the biological and clinical relevance of model outputs, thereby bridging the gap between computational analysis and translational medicine.This population-based study employed nationally representative data from the NHANES to systematically examine the association between MQI and TD in adult males. Utilizing a ML framework, we pursued three primary objectives: (1) to develop and validate an interpretable predictive model for TD risk assessment, incorporating both traditional clinical parameters and novel MQI metrics; (2) to implement SHapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP) analysis for model interpretability, quantifying the relative contribution and directional effects of each predictive feature; and (3) to elucidate clinically actionable, modifiable risk factors that could inform precision medicine approaches for the prevention and management of male TD.

## Methods

Data sourceThis study utilized a novel longitudinal dataset constructed by merging two consecutive cross-sectional cycles (2011–2012 and 2013–2014) from the NHANES, following the methodology established by Wang et al. [18]. NHANES, conducted by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), employs a sophisticated multistage, stratified probability sampling design to ensure nationally representative estimates [19]. Using the data integration approach described by Xing W et al. [20], we created a comprehensive analytical dataset by merging all study variables through unique participant identifiers (SEQN). The final dataset incorporated six key domains: (1) demographic characteristics, (2) lifestyle factors, (3) anthropometric measurements, (4) laboratory biomarkers, (5) questionnaire-derived health indicators, and (6) dietary assessment data, providing multidimensional covariates for data analysis.Ethics statementThe NHANES protocols were approved by the NCHS Ethics Review Board (Protocol #2011-17), with written informed consent obtained from all participants prior to data collection. In strict accordance with NHANES Data Use Guidelines, our analysis adhered to the following ethical standards: (1) all protected health information was de-identified prior to analytical use, (2) data were accessed solely for the purposes of this specified research, and (3) no attempts were made to re-identify participants at any stage of analysis. This secondary data analysis was determined to be exempt from additional institutional review board evaluation as it involved only anonymized, publicly available datasets.Study population and designThe present analysis utilized NHANES 2011–2014 cycles as these were the only available survey years containing complete data on standardized grip strength measurements, a critical component for calculating the MQI. From the initial cohort of 19,931 participants, we applied stringent selection criteria to derive our analytical sample. Our final analytical cohort comprised 2,628 eligible male participants (13.2% of initial sample). This selection process ensured standardized assessment conditions while minimizing potential confounding from circadian testosterone variation or musculoskeletal limitations. Based on previous studies [21, 22], in order to maximize the integrity of the dataset, participants under the age of 20 were excluded from the dataset because many laboratory indicators for this age group were not collected in the NHANES dataset. Skeletal muscle mass was measured with the use of dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scans. To ensure measurement accuracy, grip strength was measured in both hands, and the grip strength of each hand was measured three times with a 60-second interval. The inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) male; (2) the age ≥ 20 years; (3) completed serum total testosterone test; (4) complete skeletal muscle mass measurements in the extremities and grip strength tests in both hands; and (5) obtain informed consent. Exclusion criteria were (1) female; (2) the age < 20 years; (3) missing total testosterone data; (4) use of hormonal medications, history of testicular cancer or orchiectomy, and collection of blood samples in the afternoon or evening; (5) history of hand or wrist surgery or pain in the last 3 months; and (6) missing data on skeletal muscle mass, grip strength test, age, and weighted variables.Feature selection and definition of the labelBased on prior studies [6, 7, 23] and expert consensus (obtained from four independent specialists in sports medicine and andrology at the Second Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University), we initially considered 29 candidate variables (see Additional file 1) encompassing demographic characteristics, laboratory analyses, lifestyle factors, anthropometric measurements, and medical history. To ensure data quality, we excluded variables with missing values exceeding 15%, including low-density lipoprotein (LDL), homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), insulin, triglyceride (TG), triglyceride glucose (TyG) index, TyG-body mass index (BMI) index, visceral adiposity index (VAI), and lipid accumulation product (LAP). To mitigate multicollinearity and enhance model generalizability, we performed dimensionality reduction using variance inflation factor (VIF) analysis, retaining only variables with VIF < 5. Consequently, waist circumference (WC) and neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) were excluded due to high collinearity. In accordance with the American Urological Association guidelines [24], TD was defined as a serum total testosterone level below 300 ng/dL, which served as the binary classification label. Following feature selection, the final dataset comprised 1 label (TD) and 18 features (9 categorical and 9 continuous), which were subsequently used for model training and evaluation.Calculation of featuresTo identify optimal biomarkers for predicting TD in males, we evaluated several indices related to insulin resistance (IR) and obesity. HOMA-IR: calculated as fasting glucose (mmol/L) × fasting insulin (µU/mL)/22.5, as proposed by Son DH et al. [25]. TyG index: computed using the formula: ln [TG (mg/dL) × fasting glucose (mg/dL)/2], based on the method by Yang Z et al. [26], who demonstrated its superiority over HOMA-IR in assessing IR. TyG-BMI index: derived as the product of the TyG index and BMI, serving as a composite marker of obesity-related IR [27]. VAI: for males, VAI was calculated as: VAI = WC (cm)/[39.68+(1.88× BMI)]× [TG (mmol/L)/1.03] × [1.31/high-density lipoprotein (HDL) (mmol/L)], following the methodology of Cheng S et al. [28]. LAP: determined using the sex-specific formula for males: LAP = [WC (cm) − 65] × TG (mmol/L), as described by Ebrahimi M et al. [29]. The systemic immune-inflammatory index (SII): computed as platelet count × neutrophil count/lymphocyte count, in accordance with Di X et al. [30].Based on Di X’s method, the SII was calculated as platelet count × neutrophil count/lymphocyte count. The MQI: defined as the handgrip strength divided by the sum of the lean body mass of the arms and legs, following the approach of Weng L et al. [7].Handling of missing valuesMissing data are a common limitation in the NHANES dataset. Complete case analysis through direct deletion of missing values may lead to both inefficient utilization of valuable healthcare data and potential selection bias. To preserve data integrity while maximizing the retention of clinically relevant information, we implemented an advanced imputation approach for variables containing < 15% missing values. Specifically, we employed the missForest R package (version 1.5), which utilizes a random forest-based algorithm (hyperparameters: ntree = 1000, maxiter = 10, verbose = TRUE) to handle missing data [31]. This machine learning method was selected for its ability to: (1) accommodate complex variable relationships, (2) preserve the original data distribution, and (3) provide robust imputations for both continuous and categorical variables.Predictive modeling strategyTo evaluate the performance and generalization ability of the models on unseen data, we randomly split the dataset into an 80:20 ratio, with 80% (N = 2,102) allocated for training and 20% (N = 526) reserved as the test set. The training set was used for model development, while hyperparameter tuning was performed via grid search on the test set to enhance generalization performance [32]. To further ensure robust estimation of model performance, we employed 5-fold cross-validation for each hyperparameter combination, selecting the optimal configuration based on aggregated evaluation metrics [33]. In medical studies, class imbalance is a common challenge due to the low prevalence of certain diseases. When trained on imbalanced data, machine learning models tend to exhibit bias toward the majority class, leading to inflated accuracy metrics that fail to reflect true predictive performance for underrepresented classes [34]. In our dataset, the prevalence of TD (the target label) was only 25.76%, indicating significant class imbalance. To mitigate this issue, we applied the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE), which generates synthetic samples for the minority class by interpolating between neighboring instances in feature space. This approach effectively balances class distribution while preserving the intrinsic structure of the original data. However, SMOTE may inadvertently alter data distribution or introduce overfitting, particularly if synthetic samples amplify noise or outliers. To assess the fidelity of the SMOTE-processed dataset, we computed the Jaccard distance (JD) between the original and resampled data. A JD of zero confirmed that the synthetic samples did not distort the underlying data distribution [35]. Additionally, we addressed feature scaling by normalizing continuous variables using MinMaxScaler, ensuring uniform magnitude across features [36]. Categorical variables were converted into a machine-readable format via one-hot encoding, facilitating their integration into the classification model [37].Given the distinct performance characteristics of different ML algorithms, we employed six widely used classification models to predict male TD associated with MQI: Support Vector Machine (SVM), Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LGBM), Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT), Categorical Boosting (CatBoost), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and Random Forest (RF). To objectively determine the optimal model, we compared their predictive performance using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), a robust metric for evaluating classification performance, particularly in imbalanced datasets. Among the tested models, LGBM demonstrated the highest AUC, establishing it as the most effective predictor for male TD. To enhance interpretability and provide clinically meaningful insights into the model’s decision-making process, we applied the SHAP, which quantifies feature importance and reveals non-linear relationships within the model.SHAP interpretability analysisTo enhance model interpretability of our optimal model, we employed SHAP values, a unified approach rooted in cooperative game theory that provides mathematically rigorous feature attribution [38]. Unlike conventional variable importance metrics that merely rank features by their relative importance, SHAP values offer three critical advantages: (1) they quantify the exact magnitude of each feature’s contribution to individual predictions, (2) they determine the directionality of these contributions (positive or negative impact on testosterone deficiency prediction), and (3) they maintain consistency with the original model’s output through their additive property [39]. This approach enables clinically meaningful interpretation of how specific features influence the model’s decision-making process regarding TD classification.Statistical analysisAll statistical analyses of the data in this study were performed using R version 4.3.1 (https://www.r-project.org) and Python version 3.11.5 (https://www.python.org). Since NHANES uses a complex sample survey design, we used a weighted sample for our analysis. Continuous variables are expressed as median (P25, P75), and categorical variables are expressed as counts (percentages). We grouped participants according to the TD or no-TD. We used the Wilcoxon rank sum test for complex sampling to compare differences between the two groups for continuous variables and the Rao & Scott second-order corrected chi-square test for categorical variables. Multivariate logistic regression, trend test, and subgroup analysis were used to analyze the relationship between MQI and TD. We evaluate the performance of each ML model using the AUC, accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, Brier score, and the area under the precision-recall (P-R) curve (AP). The R packages we used include haven, tableone, gtsummary, survey, dplyr, plyr, tidyverse, caret, arsenal, glmnet, ggplot2, and missForest. The Python libraries we used were Scikit-learn 1.2.2 and imblearn library version 0.10.1. The difference was considered statistically significant at two-sided P < 0.05.

## Results

Baseline characteristics of participantsFigure 1 presents the participant selection flowchart, with 2,628 individuals meeting the inclusion criteria for final analysis. Table 1 summarizes the baseline characteristics stratified by TD status. The overall prevalence of TD was 25.76% (677/2,628). Among TD cases, 70.90% (480/677) were married or cohabitating. The age, married/live with partner group, diabetes group, coronary heart disease (CHD) group, insomnia group, BMI, obese group, WC, HOMA-IR, glycosylated hemoglobin (GHB), TyG index, VAI, LAP, insulin, neutrophil albumin ratio (NPAR), TG, and uric acid (UA) in the TD group were significantly higher than those in the no-TD group (P < 0.01). The never-smoke group, MQI, and HDL were significantly lower in the TD group than in the no-TD group (P < 0.05).Fig. 1The participant selection and study design flowchartFull size imageTable 1 Participants’ baseline characteristics weighted according to TD subgroupsFull size tableMultivariate logistic regression analysis of MQI and the risk of TD in malesTo capture the wide variability in MQI levels and avoid bias from subjective threshold settings, we stratified MQI levels according to quartiles to explore the threshold and dose-response relationship between MQI and TD risk in males. Table 2 shows the results of multivariate logistic regression analysis, sensitivity analysis, and trend testing, exploring the association between male MQI and TD risk. In Model 1, we observed a negative correlation between MQI and TD risk, with higher MQI associated with lower TD risk (odds ratio (OR) = 0.467, 95% confidence intervals (CI): 0.358–0.610, P < 0.001). In Model 2, after adjusting for age, the association remained statistically significant among male participants (OR = 0.490, 95% CI: 0.375–0.641, P < 0.001). In Model 3, we adjusted for more covariates. The association remained, with each unit increase in MQI associated with a 52% reduction in the risk of TD in male participants (OR = 0.480, 95% CI: 0.362–0.636, P < 0.001). Furthermore, in model 3, which was adjusted for more covariates, male participants in the highest quartile of MQI had a 69.4% lower risk of developing TD compared to those in the lowest quartile (OR = 0.306, 95% CI: 0.207–0.450, P < 0.001).Table 2 Weighted multivariate logistic regression and trend analysis of MQI and TDFull size tableSubgroup analysis of MQI and TDTable 3 shows the association between MQI and TD in different subgroups stratified by marital status, diabetes, CHD, insomnia, property income ratio (PIR), hypertension, alcohol consumption, and tobacco use, as analyzed by adjusted multivariate logistic regression. In most subgroups, after adjusted for age, NPAR, race, education attainment, and GHB, MQI remained significantly negatively correlated with the risk of TD (P < 0.05). However, no significant association between MQI and TD risk was found among participants with CHD (P = 0.938). Among participants with no CHD, MQI was significantly negatively correlated with TD risk (P < 0.001), suggesting that CHD may be a potential effect modifier. Interaction analysis showed that there were no statistically significant differences (P for interaction > 0.05) in the subgroups of marital status, diabetes, insomnia, PIR, hypertension, alcohol consumption, and tobacco use, indicating that the protective effect of MQI on TD risk was relatively consistent across these subgroups.Table 3 The relationship between MQI and TD in different subgroupsFull size tablePerformance evaluation and comparison of the modelsTable 4 presents the comparative performance metrics of six ML models—SVM, LGBM, GBDT, CatBoost, XGBoost, and RF—for predicting TD. All models were trained on the training dataset and evaluated on the test dataset across seven performance metrics: AUC, accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, Brier score, and AP. To ensure robust statistical inference, bootstrap resampling with 1,000 iterations was employed to estimate the 95% CIs for the AUC values. Among the evaluated models, the LGBM demonstrated superior predictive performance for TD, achieving the highest AUC of 0.746 (95% CI: 0.707–0.790) (Fig. 2). A comprehensive assessment of the seven discriminant metrics further confirmed the robustness and reliability of the LGBM model, with the following performance characteristics: accuracy = 91.1%, precision = 63.8%, recall = 100%, F1 score = 0.779, Brier score = 0.169, and AP = 0.490 (Fig. 3,Fig. 4). Given its optimal discriminative capability, the LGBM model was selected as the final predictive framework for TD, and SHAP were applied to enhance model interpretability. The hyperparameter configuration for the optimized LGBM model was determined as follows: bagging_fraction: 1, bagging _freq: 0, feature_fraction: 1, learning_rate: 0.1, max_bin: 255, max_depth: −1, min_data_in_leaf: 20, n_estimators: 40, num_leaves: 31.Table 4 Performance comparison of six classification ML modelsFull size tableFig. 2AUC comparison of six ML models for predicting TD.

Features were ranked in descending order of importance based on their mean absolute SHAP values. Among the evaluated predictors, BMI exhibited the highest influence on model predictions, followed by HDL, MQI, and SII. In the summary plot, feature values are color-coded, with red indicating higher values and blue representing lower values. The horizontal dispersion of SHAP values reflects the directional impact of each feature on model output—positive values (rightward distribution) correlate with an increased likelihood of TD prediction, whereas negative values (leftward distribution) suggest a reduced risk. Lower BMI values (blue) were associated with negative SHAP values, driving model predictions toward “no TD.” Conversely, reduced MQI levels (blue) contributed positively to the model’s prediction of TD occurrence. Fig. 5The SHAP global summary plot for the LGBM modelFull size imageSHAP individual force plot analysis of the LGBM modelFigure 6 presents SHAP individual force plots for two distinct prediction outcomes: (A) no TD and (B) TD. These plots quantitatively illustrate the contribution of each feature to the model’s prediction, where the horizontal axis denotes the predicted probability value f(x). The red features on the left side indicate features that increase the risk of TD, the blue features on the right side indicate features that decrease the risk of TD, and the length of the arrows represents the value of each feature’s contribution to the prediction of TD. The red and blue intersections represent the individual’s final predicted outcome, with 0 indicating no TD (Fig. 6A) and 1 indicating TD (Fig. 6B).Fig. 6The SHAP force plots for different prediction outcomes.

The decision plot offers superior interpretability compared to force plots by clearly visualizing how each feature contributes to the final prediction. The gray vertical line in the middle of the decision plot is the base value of the LGBM model predicting TD, and the purple prediction line indicates the prediction of TD, with the SHAP value for each feature marked next to the purple prediction line. The SHAP values next to the prediction line show the contribution of each feature to the final TD prediction of the LGBM model, and the direction of the turning point indicates whether the feature contributes positively or negatively to the TD prediction of the LGBM model. These SHAP values are accumulated from the base value at the bottom of the plot to the final TD prediction of the LGBM model at the top of the plot, and the final TD prediction is boiled down to 0 or 1, which means the prediction results in no TD or TD, respectively. Figure 8 presents an integrated visualization of the top 50 individual decision plots, with the blue trajectories representing the final prediction with no TD and the purple trajectories representing the final prediction with TD, and highlights the first individual prediction.Fig. 7The SHAP individual decision plot for the LGBM modelFull size imageFig. 8The LGBM model of the top 50 individual SHAP decision plotsFull size image

## Conclusions

Our SHAP-based LGBM model demonstrated superior predictive performance, outperforming conventional prediction methods. The MQI is an independent and reliable predictor for predicting TD in men. The results suggest that MQI optimization and weight management interventions may represent viable strategies for TD risk mitigation. This study establishes a novel paradigm for TD risk assessment that combines ML accuracy with clinical interpretability, addressing a critical need in medical practice. Future research should focus on prospective validation of these findings and investigation of the underlying mechanisms linking MQI, BMI, and TD pathogenesis.

## Data source

This study utilized a novel longitudinal dataset constructed by merging two consecutive cross-sectional cycles (2011–2012 and 2013–2014) from the NHANES, following the methodology established by Wang et al. [18]. NHANES, conducted by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), employs a sophisticated multistage, stratified probability sampling design to ensure nationally representative estimates [19]. Using the data integration approach described by Xing W et al. [20], we created a comprehensive analytical dataset by merging all study variables through unique participant identifiers (SEQN). The final dataset incorporated six key domains: (1) demographic characteristics, (2) lifestyle factors, (3) anthropometric measurements, (4) laboratory biomarkers, (5) questionnaire-derived health indicators, and (6) dietary assessment data, providing multidimensional covariates for data analysis.

## Ethics statement

The NHANES protocols were approved by the NCHS Ethics Review Board (Protocol #2011-17), with written informed consent obtained from all participants prior to data collection. In strict accordance with NHANES Data Use Guidelines, our analysis adhered to the following ethical standards: (1) all protected health information was de-identified prior to analytical use, (2) data were accessed solely for the purposes of this specified research, and (3) no attempts were made to re-identify participants at any stage of analysis. This secondary data analysis was determined to be exempt from additional institutional review board evaluation as it involved only anonymized, publicly available datasets.

## Study population and design

The present analysis utilized NHANES 2011–2014 cycles as these were the only available survey years containing complete data on standardized grip strength measurements, a critical component for calculating the MQI. From the initial cohort of 19,931 participants, we applied stringent selection criteria to derive our analytical sample. Our final analytical cohort comprised 2,628 eligible male participants (13.2% of initial sample). This selection process ensured standardized assessment conditions while minimizing potential confounding from circadian testosterone variation or musculoskeletal limitations. Based on previous studies [21, 22], in order to maximize the integrity of the dataset, participants under the age of 20 were excluded from the dataset because many laboratory indicators for this age group were not collected in the NHANES dataset. Skeletal muscle mass was measured with the use of dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scans. To ensure measurement accuracy, grip strength was measured in both hands, and the grip strength of each hand was measured three times with a 60-second interval. The inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) male; (2) the age ≥ 20 years; (3) completed serum total testosterone test; (4) complete skeletal muscle mass measurements in the extremities and grip strength tests in both hands; and (5) obtain informed consent. Exclusion criteria were (1) female; (2) the age < 20 years; (3) missing total testosterone data; (4) use of hormonal medications, history of testicular cancer or orchiectomy, and collection of blood samples in the afternoon or evening; (5) history of hand or wrist surgery or pain in the last 3 months; and (6) missing data on skeletal muscle mass, grip strength test, age, and weighted variables.

## Feature selection and definition of the label

Based on prior studies [6, 7, 23] and expert consensus (obtained from four independent specialists in sports medicine and andrology at the Second Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University), we initially considered 29 candidate variables (see Additional file 1) encompassing demographic characteristics, laboratory analyses, lifestyle factors, anthropometric measurements, and medical history. To ensure data quality, we excluded variables with missing values exceeding 15%, including low-density lipoprotein (LDL), homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), insulin, triglyceride (TG), triglyceride glucose (TyG) index, TyG-body mass index (BMI) index, visceral adiposity index (VAI), and lipid accumulation product (LAP). To mitigate multicollinearity and enhance model generalizability, we performed dimensionality reduction using variance inflation factor (VIF) analysis, retaining only variables with VIF < 5. Consequently, waist circumference (WC) and neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) were excluded due to high collinearity. In accordance with the American Urological Association guidelines [24], TD was defined as a serum total testosterone level below 300 ng/dL, which served as the binary classification label. Following feature selection, the final dataset comprised 1 label (TD) and 18 features (9 categorical and 9 continuous), which were subsequently used for model training and evaluation.

## Calculation of features

To identify optimal biomarkers for predicting TD in males, we evaluated several indices related to insulin resistance (IR) and obesity. HOMA-IR: calculated as fasting glucose (mmol/L) × fasting insulin (µU/mL)/22.5, as proposed by Son DH et al. [25]. TyG index: computed using the formula: ln [TG (mg/dL) × fasting glucose (mg/dL)/2], based on the method by Yang Z et al. [26], who demonstrated its superiority over HOMA-IR in assessing IR. TyG-BMI index: derived as the product of the TyG index and BMI, serving as a composite marker of obesity-related IR [27]. VAI: for males, VAI was calculated as: VAI = WC (cm)/[39.68+(1.88× BMI)]× [TG (mmol/L)/1.03] × [1.31/high-density lipoprotein (HDL) (mmol/L)], following the methodology of Cheng S et al. [28]. LAP: determined using the sex-specific formula for males: LAP = [WC (cm) − 65] × TG (mmol/L), as described by Ebrahimi M et al. [29]. The systemic immune-inflammatory index (SII): computed as platelet count × neutrophil count/lymphocyte count, in accordance with Di X et al. [30].
Based on Di X’s method, the SII was calculated as platelet count × neutrophil count/lymphocyte count. The MQI: defined as the handgrip strength divided by the sum of the lean body mass of the arms and legs, following the approach of Weng L et al. [7].

## Handling of missing values

Missing data are a common limitation in the NHANES dataset. Complete case analysis through direct deletion of missing values may lead to both inefficient utilization of valuable healthcare data and potential selection bias. To preserve data integrity while maximizing the retention of clinically relevant information, we implemented an advanced imputation approach for variables containing < 15% missing values. Specifically, we employed the missForest R package (version 1.5), which utilizes a random forest-based algorithm (hyperparameters: ntree = 1000, maxiter = 10, verbose = TRUE) to handle missing data [31]. This machine learning method was selected for its ability to: (1) accommodate complex variable relationships, (2) preserve the original data distribution, and (3) provide robust imputations for both continuous and categorical variables.

## Predictive modeling strategy

To evaluate the performance and generalization ability of the models on unseen data, we randomly split the dataset into an 80:20 ratio, with 80% (N = 2,102) allocated for training and 20% (N = 526) reserved as the test set. The training set was used for model development, while hyperparameter tuning was performed via grid search on the test set to enhance generalization performance [32]. To further ensure robust estimation of model performance, we employed 5-fold cross-validation for each hyperparameter combination, selecting the optimal configuration based on aggregated evaluation metrics [33]. In medical studies, class imbalance is a common challenge due to the low prevalence of certain diseases. When trained on imbalanced data, machine learning models tend to exhibit bias toward the majority class, leading to inflated accuracy metrics that fail to reflect true predictive performance for underrepresented classes [34]. In our dataset, the prevalence of TD (the target label) was only 25.76%, indicating significant class imbalance. To mitigate this issue, we applied the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE), which generates synthetic samples for the minority class by interpolating between neighboring instances in feature space. This approach effectively balances class distribution while preserving the intrinsic structure of the original data. However, SMOTE may inadvertently alter data distribution or introduce overfitting, particularly if synthetic samples amplify noise or outliers. To assess the fidelity of the SMOTE-processed dataset, we computed the Jaccard distance (JD) between the original and resampled data. A JD of zero confirmed that the synthetic samples did not distort the underlying data distribution [35]. Additionally, we addressed feature scaling by normalizing continuous variables using MinMaxScaler, ensuring uniform magnitude across features [36]. Categorical variables were converted into a machine-readable format via one-hot encoding, facilitating their integration into the classification model [37].
Given the distinct performance characteristics of different ML algorithms, we employed six widely used classification models to predict male TD associated with MQI: Support Vector Machine (SVM), Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LGBM), Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT), Categorical Boosting (CatBoost), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and Random Forest (RF). To objectively determine the optimal model, we compared their predictive performance using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), a robust metric for evaluating classification performance, particularly in imbalanced datasets. Among the tested models, LGBM demonstrated the highest AUC, establishing it as the most effective predictor for male TD. To enhance interpretability and provide clinically meaningful insights into the model’s decision-making process, we applied the SHAP, which quantifies feature importance and reveals non-linear relationships within the model.

## SHAP interpretability analysis

To enhance model interpretability of our optimal model, we employed SHAP values, a unified approach rooted in cooperative game theory that provides mathematically rigorous feature attribution [38]. Unlike conventional variable importance metrics that merely rank features by their relative importance, SHAP values offer three critical advantages: (1) they quantify the exact magnitude of each feature’s contribution to individual predictions, (2) they determine the directionality of these contributions (positive or negative impact on testosterone deficiency prediction), and (3) they maintain consistency with the original model’s output through their additive property [39]. This approach enables clinically meaningful interpretation of how specific features influence the model’s decision-making process regarding TD classification.

## Statistical analysis

All statistical analyses of the data in this study were performed using R version 4.3.1 (https://www.r-project.org) and Python version 3.11.5 (https://www.python.org). Since NHANES uses a complex sample survey design, we used a weighted sample for our analysis. Continuous variables are expressed as median (P25, P75), and categorical variables are expressed as counts (percentages). We grouped participants according to the TD or no-TD. We used the Wilcoxon rank sum test for complex sampling to compare differences between the two groups for continuous variables and the Rao & Scott second-order corrected chi-square test for categorical variables. Multivariate logistic regression, trend test, and subgroup analysis were used to analyze the relationship between MQI and TD. We evaluate the performance of each ML model using the AUC, accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, Brier score, and the area under the precision-recall (P-R) curve (AP). The R packages we used include haven, tableone, gtsummary, survey, dplyr, plyr, tidyverse, caret, arsenal, glmnet, ggplot2, and missForest. The Python libraries we used were Scikit-learn 1.2.2 and imblearn library version 0.10.1. The difference was considered statistically significant at two-sided P < 0.05.

## Baseline characteristics of participants

Figure 1 presents the participant selection flowchart, with 2,628 individuals meeting the inclusion criteria for final analysis. Table 1 summarizes the baseline characteristics stratified by TD status. The overall prevalence of TD was 25.76% (677/2,628). Among TD cases, 70.90% (480/677) were married or cohabitating. The age, married/live with partner group, diabetes group, coronary heart disease (CHD) group, insomnia group, BMI, obese group, WC, HOMA-IR, glycosylated hemoglobin (GHB), TyG index, VAI, LAP, insulin, neutrophil albumin ratio (NPAR), TG, and uric acid (UA) in the TD group were significantly higher than those in the no-TD group (P < 0.01). The never-smoke group, MQI, and HDL were significantly lower in the TD group than in the no-TD group (P < 0.05).

## Multivariate logistic regression analysis of MQI and the risk of TD in males

To capture the wide variability in MQI levels and avoid bias from subjective threshold settings, we stratified MQI levels according to quartiles to explore the threshold and dose-response relationship between MQI and TD risk in males. Table 2 shows the results of multivariate logistic regression analysis, sensitivity analysis, and trend testing, exploring the association between male MQI and TD risk. In Model 1, we observed a negative correlation between MQI and TD risk, with higher MQI associated with lower TD risk (odds ratio (OR) = 0.467, 95% confidence intervals (CI): 0.358–0.610, P < 0.001). In Model 2, after adjusting for age, the association remained statistically significant among male participants (OR = 0.490, 95% CI: 0.375–0.641, P < 0.001). In Model 3, we adjusted for more covariates. The association remained, with each unit increase in MQI associated with a 52% reduction in the risk of TD in male participants (OR = 0.480, 95% CI: 0.362–0.636, P < 0.001). Furthermore, in model 3, which was adjusted for more covariates, male participants in the highest quartile of MQI had a 69.4% lower risk of developing TD compared to those in the lowest quartile (OR = 0.306, 95% CI: 0.207–0.450, P < 0.001).

## Subgroup analysis of MQI and TD

Table 3 shows the association between MQI and TD in different subgroups stratified by marital status, diabetes, CHD, insomnia, property income ratio (PIR), hypertension, alcohol consumption, and tobacco use, as analyzed by adjusted multivariate logistic regression. In most subgroups, after adjusted for age, NPAR, race, education attainment, and GHB, MQI remained significantly negatively correlated with the risk of TD (P < 0.05). However, no significant association between MQI and TD risk was found among participants with CHD (P = 0.938). Among participants with no CHD, MQI was significantly negatively correlated with TD risk (P < 0.001), suggesting that CHD may be a potential effect modifier. Interaction analysis showed that there were no statistically significant differences (P for interaction > 0.05) in the subgroups of marital status, diabetes, insomnia, PIR, hypertension, alcohol consumption, and tobacco use, indicating that the protective effect of MQI on TD risk was relatively consistent across these subgroups.

## Performance evaluation and comparison of the models

Table 4 presents the comparative performance metrics of six ML models—SVM, LGBM, GBDT, CatBoost, XGBoost, and RF—for predicting TD. All models were trained on the training dataset and evaluated on the test dataset across seven performance metrics: AUC, accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, Brier score, and AP. To ensure robust statistical inference, bootstrap resampling with 1,000 iterations was employed to estimate the 95% CIs for the AUC values. Among the evaluated models, the LGBM demonstrated superior predictive performance for TD, achieving the highest AUC of 0.746 (95% CI: 0.707–0.790) (Fig. 2). A comprehensive assessment of the seven discriminant metrics further confirmed the robustness and reliability of the LGBM model, with the following performance characteristics: accuracy = 91.1%, precision = 63.8%, recall = 100%, F1 score = 0.779, Brier score = 0.169, and AP = 0.490 (Fig. 3,Fig. 4). Given its optimal discriminative capability, the LGBM model was selected as the final predictive framework for TD, and SHAP were applied to enhance model interpretability. The hyperparameter configuration for the optimized LGBM model was determined as follows: bagging_fraction: 1, bagging _freq: 0, feature_fraction: 1, learning_rate: 0.1, max_bin: 255, max_depth: −1, min_data_in_leaf: 20, n_estimators: 40, num_leaves: 31.

## Interpretation of the LGBM model using SHAP

The SHAP global summary plot was employed to quantify the contribution of each feature to the LGBM model’s predictions for TD (Fig. 5). Features were ranked in descending order of importance based on their mean absolute SHAP values. Among the evaluated predictors, BMI exhibited the highest influence on model predictions, followed by HDL, MQI, and SII. In the summary plot, feature values are color-coded, with red indicating higher values and blue representing lower values. The horizontal dispersion of SHAP values reflects the directional impact of each feature on model output—positive values (rightward distribution) correlate with an increased likelihood of TD prediction, whereas negative values (leftward distribution) suggest a reduced risk. Lower BMI values (blue) were associated with negative SHAP values, driving model predictions toward “no TD.” Conversely, reduced MQI levels (blue) contributed positively to the model’s prediction of TD occurrence.

## SHAP individual force plot analysis of the LGBM model

Figure 6 presents SHAP individual force plots for two distinct prediction outcomes: (A) no TD and (B) TD. These plots quantitatively illustrate the contribution of each feature to the model’s prediction, where the horizontal axis denotes the predicted probability value f(x). The red features on the left side indicate features that increase the risk of TD, the blue features on the right side indicate features that decrease the risk of TD, and the length of the arrows represents the value of each feature’s contribution to the prediction of TD. The red and blue intersections represent the individual’s final predicted outcome, with 0 indicating no TD (Fig. 6A) and 1 indicating TD (Fig. 6B).

## Interpretation of LGBM decision plots for TD prediction

Figure 7 illustrates the decision-making process of the LGBM model for predicting TD in an individual case. The decision plot offers superior interpretability compared to force plots by clearly visualizing how each feature contributes to the final prediction. The gray vertical line in the middle of the decision plot is the base value of the LGBM model predicting TD, and the purple prediction line indicates the prediction of TD, with the SHAP value for each feature marked next to the purple prediction line. The SHAP values next to the prediction line show the contribution of each feature to the final TD prediction of the LGBM model, and the direction of the turning point indicates whether the feature contributes positively or negatively to the TD prediction of the LGBM model. These SHAP values are accumulated from the base value at the bottom of the plot to the final TD prediction of the LGBM model at the top of the plot, and the final TD prediction is boiled down to 0 or 1, which means the prediction results in no TD or TD, respectively. Figure 8 presents an integrated visualization of the top 50 individual decision plots, with the blue trajectories representing the final prediction with no TD and the purple trajectories representing the final prediction with TD, and highlights the first individual prediction.

## Discussion

Our investigation of the MQI-TD relationship in adult American male subjects yielded three clinically significant findings: (1) Multivariable analyses revealed a robust inverse correlation between MQI and TD risk. This association persisted after full adjustment for potential confounders, establishing MQI as an independent protective factor against TD pathogenesis. (2) Sensitivity analysis revealed a significant dose-response relationship when MQI exceeded 3.085. The protective effect maintained consistency across all examined subgroups. (3) The SHAP interpretability framework provided mechanistic insights into the predictive model’s decision-making process. Key clinical variables contributing to TD risk stratification were quantitatively characterized, with MQI emerging as a dominant protective feature.This study represents the first nationally representative investigation employing an interpretable ML framework to examine the association between MQI and TD in adult US males. Our comprehensive analysis evaluated six advanced ML models (SVM, GBDT, CatBoost, XGBoost, RF, and LGBM), with the LGBM demonstrating superior predictive performance, achieving an AUC of 0.746 (95% CI: 0.707–0.790) and an accuracy of 91.1%. The model’s robustness was further validated through 1000 bootstrap resamples. Utilizing the SHAP framework, we enhanced model interpretability, enabling transparent visualization of the decision-making process and identification of key predictive features. Feature importance analysis revealed BMI as the most significant predictor, followed by HDL, MQI, and SII, with these findings corroborated by existing literature on BMI and TD associations [40, 41]. Through innovative visualization tools including individual force plots and decision plots, we provide clinicians with actionable insights into prediction pathways and case-specific risk factors. This study not only confirms MQI as an independent protective factor against TD but also establishes a novel, interpretable framework that bridges ML predictions with clinical decision-making, offering significant advancements over previous research in terms of methodological rigor, population representativeness, and clinical applicability.Our interpretable LGBM model for predicting TD in males revealed several clinically significant associations: lower MQI and HDL levels were associated with increased TD risk, while reduced BMI, SII, NPAR, and GHB levels correlated with decreased TD risk. These findings align with established physiological mechanisms, as demonstrated by Guo Y et al. [42], who identified long-term exercise training as an effective intervention against age-related testosterone decline and muscle atrophy. Further supporting our results, Fink et al.‘s comprehensive review documented that both anabolic androgenic steroids and resistance training can enhance muscle quality through testosterone-mediated pathways in various muscular disorders [43]. Collectively, these independent studies corroborate our model’s predictions and suggest a potential relationship between MQI (as reflected in our predictive features) and testosterone homeostasis. This reciprocal relationship may explain the protective associations observed in our model, particularly regarding the role of muscle-related biomarkers in TD risk modulation. The convergence of ML predictions with established biological evidence strengthens the clinical validity of our findings and supports further investigation into testosterone-muscle quality interactions in TD pathogenesis.Our ML findings regarding inflammatory and metabolic biomarkers in TD pathogenesis are strongly supported by existing biological evidence. Barbosa et al. [44] demonstrated in male athletes that pro-inflammatory states correlate with reduced testosterone levels, while healthy lifestyle interventions can attenuate this hormonal decline. These observations align mechanistically with our model’s identification of SII as a significant predictive feature for TD risk in males. Further supporting our results, Wei C et al. [45] established sex-specific relationships between SII and hormonal profiles, showing positive SII-estradiol correlations in females while confirming the SII-TD association in males that our model detected. The broader clinical context is provided by Traish AM’s comprehensive review [46], which identifies obesity, metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia as established risk factors for TD that subsequently increase cardiovascular risk - all conditions intimately linked to the inflammatory and metabolic biomarkers featured in our predictive model. Most compellingly, Liang J et al. [47] not only confirmed the obesity-TD association through clinical observations but also identified miR-300-3p as a specific molecular mediator in obese male mice, demonstrating that targeted inhibition of this microRNA effectively alleviates TD symptoms. This growing body of evidence, spanning from clinical correlations to molecular mechanisms, provides robust biological plausibility for our ML-derived associations between inflammatory markers (SII), metabolic parameters (BMI, GHB), and TD risk in males. The convergence of these independent research findings with our computational predictions strongly validates our model’s clinical relevance while suggesting promising directions for future mechanistic studies and targeted interventions.This study introduces an innovative SHAP-based interpretable prediction model, representing a significant methodological advancement over previous TD prediction and correlation analyses in male populations. Our ML approach demonstrates three key advantages compared to conventional analytical methods: (1) superior capability in identifying complex interactions between TD and multifaceted clinical variables, (2) enhanced predictive efficiency through advanced ensemble learning algorithms, and (3) improved clinical utility via model interpretability [48]. The implementation of interpretable ML for TD prediction addresses critical limitations of traditional approaches by enabling transparent decision-making processes while maintaining high predictive performance. Our approach specifically addresses these challenges through: (1) utilization of a nationally representative dataset, (2) incorporation of biologically plausible predictive features, and (3) implementation of interpretability frameworks that enable clinical validation of model outputs. This balanced integration of advanced computational methods with clinical research principles represents a meaningful advancement in TD risk prediction and sets a precedent for future applications of interpretable ML in movement disorders research.This study presents several notable strengths that enhance the validity and clinical applicability of our findings. First, our analysis leveraged the NHANES dataset, a nationally representative data source with rigorous quality control measures, combined with advanced ensemble ML techniques to develop a robust TD prediction model. Second, the implementation of SHAP interpretability framework represents a significant methodological advancement, effectively transforming the LGBM model from an algorithmic “black box” into a clinically transparent decision-support tool that clearly elucidates the contribution of each predictive feature in male TD risk assessment. However, several limitations should be acknowledged when interpreting our results. First, the presence of substantial missing data (> 15%) for certain potentially relevant variables in the NHANES dataset necessitated their exclusion, which may have affected model comprehensiveness. Second, while the use of NHANES data ensures generalizability to the US population, the external validity of our LGBM model for other geographic regions and ethnic populations requires further verification through independent validation studies. These limitations highlight important considerations for future research, including the need for more complete clinical datasets and multinational validation cohorts to enhance the global applicability of our predictive framework.
