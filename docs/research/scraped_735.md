## Abstract

Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are neurodevelopmental disorders characterized by various neurobehavioral impairments. This study aims to review the preventive and therapeutic effects of Resveratrol (RSV) against ASD during various stages of life, specifically focusing on its influence on behavioral and neurodevelopmental biochemical mechanisms.
On December 6, 2024, a comprehensive electronic search was conducted across several high-coverage databases, including Web of Science, Scopus, PubMed/MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Library. The most important data were extracted and reviewed after screening the publications based on our inclusion and exclusion criteria.
RSV alleviates autistic-like social behaviors by promoting social interaction and mitigating repetitive behaviors, anxiety, and symptoms resembling depression. RSV influences chemokine receptor expression, diminishes pro-inflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and interferon-gamma (IFN-γ), and regulates mitochondrial function by reducing nitrosative stress and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) levels, while also increasing antioxidant markers like glutathione (GSH), catalase (CAT), and superoxide dismutase (SOD) in the brain. Additionally, it enhances neuronal organization, increases the proportions of interneurons (SOM+, PV+, CB+), and restores the integrity of the hippocampus. Moreover, RSV modulates epigenetic pathways, such as estrogen receptorbeta (ERβ) activation and sirtuin 1 (Sirt1) expression, counteracts learning, memory, and locomotor activity deficits, and normalizes cortical oscillations. It also potentially modulated gutbrain- axis dysregulation and neurotransmitters.
RSV has shown promising effects on ASD, primarily through its influence on behavioral, neuromolecular, and neurodevelopmental mechanisms.
