# De Novo GLI2 Missense Variant in a Child With Isolated Hypopituitarism and Craniofacial Anomalies: Expanding the Phenotypic Spectrum.

## Abstract

Culler-Jones syndrome (CJS) is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by hypopituitarism, postaxial polydactyly, and craniofacial anomalies, associated with pathogenic GLI2 variants. Genotype-phenotype correlations suggest missense variants may present with isolated pituitary phenotypes. We evaluated an 8-year-old boy referred for short stature, failure to thrive, and neurodevelopmental concerns. Clinical assessment, endocrine evaluation, imaging studies, and trio exome sequencing were performed. The patient exhibited growth hormone deficiency, dolichocephaly, midline diastema, lip and tongue ties, hypotonia, and ADHD. No polydactyly was noted. Trio exome sequencing revealed a de novo heterozygous likely pathogenic GLI2 variant (c.1496G>T; p.Arg499Leu) located within the DNA-binding zinc finger domain. This case expands the phenotypic spectrum of GLI2-related disorders and reinforces that non-truncating GLI2 variants are often associated with isolated hypopituitarism and subtle craniofacial or neurodevelopmental features. Genomic testing should be considered in similar clinical presentations.
