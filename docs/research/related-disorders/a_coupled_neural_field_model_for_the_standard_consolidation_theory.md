## Abstract
The standard consolidation theory states that short-term memories located in the hippocampus enable the consolidation of long-term memories in the neocortex. In other words, the neocortex slowly learns long-term memories with a transient support of the hippocampus that quickly learns unstable memories. However, it is not clear yet what could be the neurobiological mechanisms underlying these differences in learning rates and memory time-scales. Here, we propose a novel modelling approach of the standard consolidation theory, that focuses on its potential neurobiological mechanisms. In addition to synaptic plasticity and spike frequency adaptation, our model incorporates adult neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus as well as the difference in size between the neocortex and the hippocampus, that we associate with distance-dependent synaptic plasticity. We also take into account the interconnected spatial structure of the involved brain areas, by incorporating the above neurobiological mechanisms in a coupled neural field framework, where each area is represented by a separate neural field with intra- and inter-area connections. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to apply neural fields to this process. Using numerical simulations and mathematical analysis, we explore the short-term and long-term dynamics of the model upon alternance of phases of hippocampal replay and retrieval cue of an external input. This external input is encodable as a memory pattern in the form of a multiple bump attractor pattern in the individual neural fields. In the model, hippocampal memory patterns become encoded first, before neocortical ones, because of the smaller distances between the bumps of the hippocampal memory patterns. As a result, retrieval of the input pattern in the neocortex at short time-scales necessitates the additional input delivered by the memory pattern of the hippocampus. Neocortical memory patterns progressively consolidate at longer times, up to a point where their retrieval does not need the support of the hippocampus anymore. At longer times, perturbation of the hippocampal neural fields by neurogenesis erases the hippocampus pattern, leading to a final state where the memory pattern is exclusively evoked in the neocortex. Therefore, the dynamics of our model successfully reproduces the main features of the standard consolidation theory. This suggests that neurogenesis in the hippocampus and distance-dependent synaptic plasticity coupled to synaptic depression and spike frequency adaptation, are indeed critical neurobiological processes in memory consolidation.
