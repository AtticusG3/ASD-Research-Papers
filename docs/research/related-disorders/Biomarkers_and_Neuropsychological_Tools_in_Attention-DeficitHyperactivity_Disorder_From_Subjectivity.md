## Abstract

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a prevalent neurodevelopmental disorder with chronic inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity and is linked with significant functional impairment. Despite being highly prevalent, diagnosis of ADHD continues to rely on subjective assessment reports of behavior and is often delayed or inaccurate. This review summarizes current advances in biomarkers and neuropsychological tests for the improvement of ADHD diagnosis and treatment. Key biomarkers are neuroimaging methods (e.g., structural and functional MRI), electrophysiological measures (e.g., EEG, ERP), and biochemical measures (e.g., cortisol, vitamin D). Additionally, novel experimental measures, e.g., eye-tracking, pupillometry, and microbiome analysis, hold the promise to be objective and dynamic measures of ADHD symptoms. The review also comments on the impact of the burden of ADHD on quality of life, e.g., emotional well-being, academic achievement, and social functioning. Additionally, differences between individuals, such as age, sex, comorbidities, and the impact of social and family support, are also addressed in relation to ADHD outcomes. In summary, we highlight the potential of these emerging biomarkers and tools to revolutionize ADHD diagnosis and guide personalized treatment strategies. These insights have significant implications for improving patient outcomes.
