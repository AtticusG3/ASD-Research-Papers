## Abstract

The exploration of awareness and knowledge on FASD amongst the Noongar people in the Southwest region of Western Australia (WA) was the focus of this research. FASD is a neurodevelopmental disability caused by prenatal alcohol exposure resulting in lifelong disabilities impacting children, families, kinship caregivers, foster carers, and communities. This Aboriginal led research was underpinned by Indigenous methodology utilising a developed culturally appropriate survey tool completed by 180 Aboriginal people in WA. Questions included the history of colonisation in Australia. Quantitative analysis of the survey results was undertaken. It was identified by 92% of respondents that they felt it was important to know about FASD and low awareness of FASD exists, and only 20% had received information on FASD. Participants wanted to receive more information on FASD and culturally preferred approaches to training included small groups, community forums, or one to one learning. The majority of participants identified that they had experienced the removal of an immediate member of their family or themselves, or were a member of the Stolen Generations. The results highlight that awareness, knowledge, and education can contribute to the prevention of FASD and support effective interventions on country and in the community. SO WHAT?: The impact of FASD, a neurodevelopmental disability, has largely gone unrecognised, prompting an urgent need to support children, families and communities in Australia.
