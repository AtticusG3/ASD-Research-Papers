## Abstract

Global developmental delay (GDD) is a common childhood neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by the core symptoms of cognitive impairment. However, the underlying neural mechanisms of the cognitive impairment remain unclear. This study aimed to both analyze differences in electroencephalography (EEG) connectivity patterns between children with GDD and typical development (TD) using brain functional connectivity and to explore the neural mechanisms linking these differences to cognitive impairment. The study enrolled 60 children with GDD and 60 TD children. GDD participants underwent clinical assessment via the Gesell Developmental Schedule (GDS). Resting-state EEG data were subjected to brain functional connectivity analysis and graph theory metric-based network analysis, with intergroup functional differences compared. Subsequently, correlation analysis characterized the relationships between GDD subject's brain network metrics and GDS-derived cognitive developmental quotient (DQ). Finally, three support vector machine (SVM) models were constructed for GDD classification and feature weight factors were calculated to screen potential EEG biomarkers. The two groups exhibited complex differences in functional connectivity. Compared with the TD group, the GDD group showed a large number of increased functional connections in the Children with GDD exhibit abnormal patterns of brain functional connectivity, characterized by global hypo-connectivity and local hyper-connectivity. Specific network metrics under these abnormal patterns are significantly correlated with cognitive impairment in GDD. This study also highlights the potential of the Î³-band characteristic path length as an EEG biomarker for diagnosing GDD.
