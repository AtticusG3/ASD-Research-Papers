## Abstract
Selecting an appropriate oral contraceptive can be challenging for healthcare professionals due to the abundance of marketed contraceptive options with different clinical and real-world effectiveness and safety profiles. Nomegestrol acetate + 17β-estradiol (NOMAC/E2) is a combined oral contraceptive (COC) that inhibits ovulation by suppressing ovarian function by a 17-hydroxy-progesterone derivative and an estrogen identical to that endogenously produced by the ovaries. This narrative review examines clinical and real-world studies of NOMAC/E2 based on a background literature search using PubMed and Google Scholar. The review outlines the pharmacology of NOMAC/E2, including its progestational activity, pharmacokinetics, and effects on carbohydrate metabolism, lipid metabolism, and coagulation parameters, and summarizes key clinical efficacy and safety data that led to the approval of NOMAC/E2 in Europe, Brazil, and Australia. To help elucidate how NOMAC/E2 clinical trial data translate into a real-world setting, this review describes the effectiveness and safety of NOMAC/E2 in prospective studies that include over 90,000 users (half of whom received NOMAC/E2), outlining its effects on risk of thrombosis, menstrual bleeding patterns, weight, mood, acne, bone health, and patient quality of life. Non-contraceptive benefits of NOMAC/E2 for women with endometriosis, dysmenorrhea, or pre-menstrual dysphoric disorder are also discussed. These data demonstrate that NOMAC/E2 has a long half-life and rapid absorption, is effective at preventing unwanted pregnancies, and exhibits a favorable safety profile in both clinical trials and real-world settings. Importantly, NOMAC/E2 is not associated with increased risk of venous thromboembolism, a major safety concern of healthcare professionals for women receiving hormonal contraceptives. This review highlights NOMAC/E2 as a differentiated option among COCs and could help inform oral contraceptive choice to ultimately improve patient management and outcomes in real-world settings.
