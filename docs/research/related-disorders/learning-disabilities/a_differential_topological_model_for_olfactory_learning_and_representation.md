## Abstract
This thesis is designed to be a self-contained exposition of the neurobiological and mathematical aspects of sensory perception, memory, and learning with a bias towards olfaction. The final chapters introduce a new approach to modeling focusing more on the geometry of the system as opposed to element wise dynamics. Additionally, we construct an organism independent model for olfactory processing: something which is currently missing from the literature.
