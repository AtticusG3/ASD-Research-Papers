Pathogenic gain-of-function or dominant-negative effect missense variations in
We collected 14 individuals and 1 fetus carrying a heterozygous deletion including
Twelve out of 17 individuals presented with ID, and 3 out of 17 with learning disabilities. Speech delay and behavioural abnormalities were observed in 15 out of 17 and 12 out of 17 individuals, respectively, motor delay in 9 out of 17 and growth restriction in 9 out of 18. Most of the individuals (13/18) had recognisable dysmorphic features. 11 anomalies were de novo, except for 1 deletion inherited from the mother. The size of the deletion varied from 125 kb to 1.6 Mb and could result from a fork stalling and template switching.

background pathogenic gain-of-function or dominant-negative effect missense variations in actb are associated with a neurodevelopmental disorder characterised by intellectual disability (id), seizures, sensorineural hearing loss, cerebral, renal and ocular abnormalities and dysmorphic features (baraitser-winter cerebrofrontofacial syndrome). actb encodes beta-actin, a highly conserved protein involved in cell motility, structure and integrity. deletions including actb, and, more rarely, single-nucleotide loss-of-function variants in actb have been described in patients with a distinct phenotype including developmental delay, id, microcephaly, growth restriction, cardiac and renal abnormalities and dysmorphic features. methods we collected 14 individuals and 1 fetus carrying a heterozygous deletion including actb , and 4 individuals with a heterozygous truncating variant. genotypic and phenotypic data were analysed. furthermore, a comprehensive review of all cases reported to date was also undertaken. results twelve out of 17 individuals presented with id, and 3 out of 17 with learning disabilities. speech delay and behavioural abnormalities were observed in 15 out of 17 and 12 out of 17 individuals, respectively, motor delay in 9 out of 17 and growth restriction in 9 out of 18. most of the individuals (13/18) had recognisable dysmorphic features. 11 anomalies were de novo, except for 1 deletion inherited from the mother. the size of the deletion varied from 125 kb to 1.6 mb and could result from a fork stalling and template switching. conclusion this study allowed us to better characterise the phenotype associated with the haploinsufficiency of actb, underlying the high prevalence of neurodevelopmental disorders (id, speech and motor delay, behavioural abnormalities) and growth restriction in this recognisable syndrome. genetic counseling cytogenetics genetics sequence analysis, dna human genetics data availability statement all data relevant to the study are included in the article or uploaded as online supplemental information. googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display("dfp-ad-mpu"); }); https://doi.org/10.1136/jmg-2025-110631 statistics from altmetric.com request permissions if you wish to reuse any or all of this article please use the link below which will take you to the copyright clearance center’s rightslink service. you will be able to get a quick price and instant permission to reuse the content in many different ways. genetic counseling cytogenetics genetics sequence analysis, dna human genetics data availability statement all data relevant to the study are included in the article or uploaded as online supplemental information. view full text footnotes contributors ml-s collected all the data (clinical and genetic), analysed them and made the figures and tables. vm analysed the data and wrote the manuscript. all authors read and approved the final manuscript. kw, es, a-lp, ap, agol, jp, nb, rc, op, pkvk, eg, jlen, jrf and mr performed the clinical assessment of patients. ml-s, agou, nc, mq, pc, sr, gb, jlev, pk, md-f, sbo, clc, jc, gd, sba, vc, ss, sbr and vm performed the genetic analysis of the patients. vm certifies that all patients or legal guardians have given written consent for the publication of clinical and genetic data and/or photographs. vm is the guarantor. funding the authors have not declared a specific grant for this research from any funding agency in the public, commercial or not-for-profit sectors. competing interests none declared. provenance and peer review not commissioned; externally peer reviewed. supplemental material this content has been supplied by the author(s). it has not been vetted by bmj publishing group limited (bmj) and may not have been peer-reviewed. any opinions or recommendations discussed are solely those of the author(s) and are not endorsed by bmj. bmj disclaims all liability and responsibility arising from any reliance placed on the content. where the content includes any translated material, bmj does not warrant the accuracy and reliability of the translations (including but not limited to local regulations, clinical guidelines, terminology, drug names and drug dosages), and is not responsible for any error and/or omissions arising from translation and adaptation or otherwise. read the full text or download the pdf: subscribe log in log in via institution log in via openathens log in via ccmg log in using your username and password for personal accounts or managers of institutional accounts username * password * forgot your log in details?
