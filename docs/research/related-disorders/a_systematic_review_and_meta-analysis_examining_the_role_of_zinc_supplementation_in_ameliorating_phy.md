## Abstract
Zinc has been associated with a reduction in symptoms severity in females with Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) in recent trials. This meta analysis of randomized clinical trials (RCTs) was performed to assess the efficacy of zinc supplements in alleviating the physical and psychological symptoms of PMS. A thorough search of electronic repositories was meticulously undertaken until May 2023. Studies that observed the influence of zinc on symptoms severity pertaining to PMS in females were included. A threshold of significance was set at a p-value of 0.05 with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) across all estimates. All statistical analysis was carried out using software Review Manager v.5.4. This analysis encompassed five studies. Compared to the placebo group, females with PMS who received zinc supplements showed significant improvement in physical health (MD: 3.69, CI: 1.65 - 5.74, P: 0.0004), and physical symptoms (MD: -0.79, CI: -1.39 - -0.20, P: 0.009). Regarding the subdomains of PMS symptoms assessed using the Premenstrual Symptoms Screening Tool (PSST) scale, zinc supplementation was associated with a significant decrease in anger (P: 0.005), anxiety (P: 0.04), and tearfulness (P: < 0.0001). In the interest-related domain, zinc supplementation significantly decreased lack of interest in work activities (P: 0.005) and social activities (P: 0005). Within the cognitive domain, zinc supplementation was associated with a significant decrease in difficulty concentrating (p = 0.02). Significant decreases were found for insomnia (p < 0.00001), hypersomnia (p = 0.006), feeling overwhelmed (p = 0.05), and overeating (p = 0.0003). The results of this meta analysis posit zinc as an effective remedy for alleviating symptoms of PMS in young females.
