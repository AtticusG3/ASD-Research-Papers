# Personality Disorders & Personality Traits in Tourette Syndrome (TS)  
_Last updated: 2025-10-21_

## Overview  
This note summarises what the literature currently suggests about personality disorders (PDs) and personality/trait profiles in people with Tourette syndrome (TS). The focus is on:  
- PD diagnoses (categorical) in TS  
- Personality traits or styles (dimensional) in TS  
- What has been found **linked** vs what remains **unclear or refuted**  
- Key studies with links  
- Gaps / future research search terms

## Key Studies  
Here are some of the major empirical investigations to date:

1. **Personality disorder and psychopathology in Tourette's syndrome: A controlled study** (Robertson M.M., Banerjee S., Fox-Hiley P.J., Tannock C., 1997)  
   - Adult TS patients (n ≈ 39) vs controls (n ≈ 34) assessed with SCID-II and STCPD for personality disorders. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}  
   - Findings: 64% of TS patients had one or more PDs vs ~6% of controls. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}  
   - TS patients also had significantly more depression, anxiety, obsessionality. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}  
   - Significance: One of the first controlled studies showing high PD prevalence in a TS clinic population.

2. **A controlled study of personality and affect in Tourette syndrome** (Eddy C.M., Rickards H.E., Critchley H.D., Cavanna A.E., 2013)  
   - 25 adults ~TS (some comorbid OCD/ADHD) vs 25 matched controls. :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}  
   - They measured Big-Five style traits (Ten-Item Personality Index), Positive/Negative Affect Scale, Beck Depression Inventory. :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}  
   - Findings: TS group showed **reduced extraversion** and **reduced emotional stability** (i.e., higher neuroticism) compared to controls — especially in “pure” TS (without comorbidities). Personality scores were **not related** to tic severity. :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}  
   - Significance: Highlights trait-level differences (dimensional) rather than full PD diagnoses. Suggests that even excluding depression/comorbidity, personality style may differ in TS.

3. **Schizotypal personality traits in Gilles de la Tourette syndrome** (Year ~2006)  
   - Investigated whether TS is associated with “schizophrenia-like” or schizotypal personality traits. :contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10}  
   - Results were equivocal / limited.  
   - Significance: Suggests some exploration into cluster A type traits, but no strong consistent association.

4. **The Rorschach test and Gilles de la Tourette’s syndrome: A pilot case–control study** (Balottin U., Nanti M., et al., 2009)  
   - 17 paediatric TS patients vs 17 healthy controls. :contentReference[oaicite:12]{index=12}  
   - Findings: TS patients had indicators of **reduced emotional control**, increased aggression/anxiety, more rigid defence mechanisms. Comorbidity with ADHD was associated with more emotional instability; severity of tics/OCD associated with hyper-control/rigidity. :contentReference[oaicite:13]{index=13}  
   - Significance: Exploratory, projective measure study – shows possible personality *style* differences in TS, particularly in children/adolescents.

5. **Major and minor life events, personality and psychopathology in children with Tourette’s syndrome** (2017)  
   - Studied interplay between life events (stress), personality traits, tic severity and comorbidities. :contentReference[oaicite:15]{index=15}  
   - Findings: Personality traits and environmental stressors may moderate tic expression and comorbidity.  
   - Significance: Adds dimension of trait × environment in TS.

6. **Other relevant: “Personality Traits in patients with Tourette Syndrome” by Müller-Vahl (Scientific session)†**  
   - Slide/abstract only via the Tourette Association of America website. :contentReference[oaicite:17]{index=17}  
   - Significance: Indicates ongoing interest in trait profiles in TS.

† Note: conference/abstract data — less peer-reviewed.

## Personality Disorders / Traits — Linked vs Not (so far)  

### Linked / Positive associations  
- **Increased prevalence of personality disorders** in adult TS clinic populations (Robertson et al. 1997).  
- **Reduced emotional stability (higher neuroticism)** and **reduced extraversion** in TS (Eddy et al. 2013).  
- **Personality style differences** in children/adolescents with TS: emotional instability, aggression, rigid defences (Balottin et al. 2009).  
- **Trait × environment interactions**: life events, stress may exacerbate tic severity in those with certain personality trait profiles (2017 study).  
- Some suggestion of **obsessionality/perfectionism**, or “just-right” feelings, in TS (though more trait than full PD).  
- Association with **impulsivity/disinhibition** in TS with comorbid ADHD, which might reflect externalising personality traits.

### Traits/Diagnoses with weak/uncertain association or **denied**  
- No clear evidence that **specific PD subtypes** (e.g., antisocial, borderline, avoidant) are consistently elevated in TS; the initial Robertson study grouped “one or more PDs” without strong subtype breakdown.  
- For the “pure” TS (without comorbidities) group, tic severity was *not* correlated with personality trait scores (Eddy et al.).  
- Studies using projective tests (Rorschach) are exploratory and small; findings need replication.  
- There is **no solid evidence** that TS is associated with full-blown cluster A PDs (e.g., schizotypal) in a consistent way — the study into schizotypal traits is equivocal (Schizotypal personality traits in TS).  
- Causality unclear: Whether PD/trait differences are driven by TS per se, by comorbidities (ADHD/OCD/Anxiety/Mood disorders) or psychosocial consequence of living with TS remains ambiguous.

## Summary Table  

| Category            | Evidence in TS                            | Notes |
|---------------------|------------------------------------------|-------|
| Full personality disorders (categorical) | Elevated (~64 % in one study) in adult clinic TS patients vs controls. :contentReference[oaicite:18]{index=18} | Clinic-based sample, may reflect referral bias. |
| Dimensional personality traits – Emotional Stability / Neuroticism | TS patients show lower emotional stability (more neuroticism) compared to controls. :contentReference[oaicite:19]{index=19} | Appears independent of tic severity in one study. |
| Dimensional personality traits – Extraversion | TS patients showed reduced extraversion (less outgoing) compared to controls. :contentReference[oaicite:20]{index=20} | May impact social functioning. |
| Personality style in children/adolescents | Indicators: reduced emotion control, higher aggression/anxiety, rigid defences (Balottin et al.) :contentReference[oaicite:21]{index=21} | Small sample, needs replication. |
| Trait × environmental stress interaction | Life events/stress + personality traits moderate tic severity/comorbidity. :contentReference[oaicite:22]{index=22} | Suggests dynamic model. |
| Specific PD sub-types (e.g., borderline, antisocial, schizotypal) | Limited and inconsistent evidence. Schizotypal traits studied but equivocal. :contentReference[oaicite:23]{index=23} | More research needed. |
| Correlation between tic severity and personality/PD | Some studies found **no** correlation (e.g., Eddy et al.) :contentReference[oaicite:24]{index=24} | Suggests trait/PD may be somewhat independent of tic severity. |

## Gaps & Notes for Future Research  
- Many studies are clinic-based, adult populations, small sample sizes → need **large, community-based, prospective** studies.  
- Need **clear subtype breakdowns** of personality disorders in TS (which PDs, cluster A/B/C, trait profiles).  
- Studies on children/adolescents are fewer; developmental trajectories of personality/PD in TS are under-explored.  
- Need to **control for comorbidities** (especially ADHD, OCD, mood/anxiety disorders) because these can confound PD/trait associations.  
- Need to disentangle **cause vs consequence**: Are personality/PD profiles part of the TS phenotype (shared neurobiology) or are they secondary to living with TS (psychosocial stress, stigma, impairment)?  
- Investigate the **mechanisms**: how do tic burden, premonitory urges, suppression efforts, social stigma, comorbidity feed into personality evolution?  
- Expand trait-based research (e.g., Big Five, Five-Factor Model, alternative DSM-5 trait model) rather than only categorical PDs.  
- Study links between personality/PD profiles and **outcomes** in TS: quality of life, social/occupational functioning, response to behavioural/medical treatments.
