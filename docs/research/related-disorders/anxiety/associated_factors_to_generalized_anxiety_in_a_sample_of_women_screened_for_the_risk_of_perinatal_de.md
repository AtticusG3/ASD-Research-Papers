## Abstract
The perinatal period is critical for women's physical and mental health. Anxiety and depressive symptoms are common, impacting both mothers and peripartum outcomes. This multicenter study in Southern Italy assessed 969 women attending three gynecological departments from January to November 2022. Evaluations occurred in the third trimester (T0) and at 7 days, 1 month, and 6 months postpartum (T1, T2, T3). The Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) and Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) screened for perinatal anxiety and depression. Additional measures assessed neuroticism, coping, attachment, resilience, and quality of life. A structured clinical interview confirmed anxiety diagnoses. At baseline, 8.97 % had generalized anxiety and 14.9 % screened positive for depression. Anxiety and depression were interrelated across time points. Generalized anxiety was linked to prior mental health issues, stressful life events, and premenstrual syndrome. Higher anxiety severity correlated with lower resilience, poorer quality of life, and maladaptive coping. Depressive symptoms persisted postpartum. Logistic regression identified key predictors of Generalized Anxiety Disorder, including higher EPDS scores, neuroticism, lower quality of life, avoidance, denial coping, emotional support needs, and premenstrual syndrome. Routine screening, early intervention, and resilience-building are essential for individuals with high neuroticism, insecure attachment, or vulnerable coping strategies.
