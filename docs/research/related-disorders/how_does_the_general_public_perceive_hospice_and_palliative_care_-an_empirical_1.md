## Abstract

Global aging and rising chronic disease burden have made hospice and palliative care (HPC) a healthcare priority. China has initiated three rounds of HPC pilot programs covering two-thirds of its cities, yet public utilization remains low. Understanding public knowledge, attitude, and preference (KAP) toward HPC is essential to overcoming adoption barriers and fostering acceptance.
To empirically evaluate public KAP for HPC, pinpoint influencing factors, and offer targeted strategies to address challenges.
This cross-sectional study assessed public KAP using the culturally adapted Public Knowledge, Attitude, and Preference of HPC Scale (P-KAPHPCs). Regression analysis was applied to identify factors associated with KAP. A structural equation model was constructed to test their interrelationship.
Among all the respondents, the mean score for HPC knowledge was 7.47 ± 2.14, with 41.10% of the respondents could explain HPC. Educational level and household income were associated factors of knowledge (p < 0.05). The overall attitude mean score rate was 84.18%. Public attitude toward end-of-life (EOL) arrangements for terminally ill patients was significantly influenced by age, attitude toward one's own EOL care were affected by educational level (p < 0.05). The majority (67.80%) declined life-sustaining treatment (LST), with preference linked to gender, occupation, experience of witnessing a patient's EOL process, primary family decision-makers, and family size (p < 0.05). Most respondents (47.30%) preferred home as the place for the EOL care. Structural equation modeling analysis showed that knowledge was positively associated with attitude (β = 4.97, p < 0.001) and knowledge was positively associated with preference (β = 0.22, p < 0.001).
The public attitude toward HPC is generally positive, though there is a need to improve the quality of public knowledge, and preference varies. Knowledge has a positive influence on both attitude and preference. Traditional cultural values and ethics sometimes create conflicts in HPC decision-making. Therefore, it is recommended to strengthen HPC education, enhance legal protections for advance care planning (ACP) and advance directives (AD), introduce culturally appropriate family consensus communication tools, and establish a home-community hybrid care model.

context global aging and rising chronic disease burden have made hospice and palliative care (hpc) a healthcare priority. china has initiated three rounds of hpc pilot programs covering two-thirds of its cities, yet public utilization remains low. understanding public knowledge, attitude, and preference (kap) toward hpc is essential to overcoming adoption barriers and fostering acceptance. objectives to empirically evaluate public kap for hpc, pinpoint influencing factors, and offer targeted strategies to address challenges. methods this cross-sectional study assessed public kap using the culturally adapted public knowledge, attitude, and preference of hpc scale (p-kaphpcs). regression analysis was applied to identify factors associated with kap. a structural equation model was constructed to test their interrelationship. results among all the respondents, the mean score for hpc knowledge was 7.47 ± 2.14, with 41.10% of the respondents could explain hpc. educational level and household income were associated factors of knowledge ( p < 0.05). the overall attitude mean score rate was 84.18%. public attitude toward end-of-life (eol) arrangements for terminally ill patients was significantly influenced by age, attitude toward one’s own eol care were affected by educational level ( p < 0.05). the majority (67.80%) declined life-sustaining treatment (lst), with preference linked to gender, occupation, experience of witnessing a patient’s eol process, primary family decision-makers, and family size ( p < 0.05). most respondents (47.30%) preferred home as the place for the eol care. structural equation modeling analysis showed that knowledge was positively associated with attitude ( β = 4.97, p < 0.001) and knowledge was positively associated with preference ( β = 0.22, p < 0.001). conclusions the public attitude toward hpc is generally positive, though there is a need to improve the quality of public knowledge, and preference varies. knowledge has a positive influence on both attitude and preference. traditional cultural values and ethics sometimes create conflicts in hpc decision-making. therefore, it is recommended to strengthen hpc education, enhance legal protections for advance care planning (acp) and advance directives (ad), introduce culturally appropriate family consensus communication tools, and establish a home-community hybrid care model. peer review reports introduction with global population aging and the rising burden of chronic non-communicable diseases, there is growing recognition of the need for a more compassionate and patient-centered approach to end-of-life (eol) care [ 1 ]. hospice and palliative care (hpc) has been widely acknowledged as a pivotal intervention to enhance the quality of life for terminally ill patients and their families. in china, despite the implementation of three rounds of hpc pilot programs since 2017, the actual utilization remains remarkably low, with bed occupancy rates in some areas falling below 20% [ 2 ]. within china’s unique sociocultural context, several deeply rooted beliefs—such as the association of filial piety with life-prolonging interventions, the cultural taboo surrounding death-related discussions, and the prevailing view that “better a bad life than a good death”—hinder meaningful engagement with hpc. these factors constrain the effectiveness of hpc, even where services are adequately available. consequently, understanding the public’s knowledge, attitude, and preference (kap) regarding hpc becomes critically important to identify culturally specific barriers and inform context-sensitive strategies to promote service uptake. international studies have consistently highlighted the importance of public kap toward hpc in its successful adoption [ 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 ]. however, research in china has primarily focused on the kap of medical professionals and terminally ill patients, or is limited to specific regions and groups such as the elderly, community residents, and chronic disease patients, which restricts capturing the diverse perspectives of the general public [ 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 ]. furthermore, several studies have concentrated on sub-topics such as advance care planning (acp) and advance directives (ad), yet these have not been integrated into the broader framework of hpc services. as a result, this has led to a fragmented understanding of the public’s genuine needs and the barriers they face [ 12 , 13 , 14 ]. moreover, survey instruments, which were adapted from those designed for medical professionals, have not undergone adequate cultural adjustments. this hampers their ability to accurately capture the unique perspectives of the general public within their specific cultural context. finally, existing research fails to provide a comprehensive exploration of the interrelationships among the three components of kap, along with the pathways through which they influence each other [ 15 , 16 , 17 , 18 ]. to bridge the gap, this study focuses on the public perspective, providing a comprehensive assessment of the kap of the general public across china using a culturally adapted and locally validated kap scale. by exploring key influencing factors and potential barriers, this study aims to foster greater public engagement with hpc and improve the quality of eol care in china. ultimately, it seeks to generate evidence-based insight to inform targeted interventions for hpc development, contributing to its broader integration into the healthcare system and societal discourse. methods statistical methods statistical analyses were performed using ibm spss statistics 27.0 (ibm corporation, armonk, ny). descriptive statistics were used to analyze the respondents’ demographic, health status information and kap scores. continuous variables were described by mean ± standard deviation (sd), while categorical variables were presented as frequency and percentages. one-way analyses and regression analyses were used to explore the factors that influence kap. structural equation modeling (sem) was constructed to explore the causal relationship between observed and latent variables, with kap as latent variables and their secondary dimensions as observed variables in the hypothetical model. fit indices such as pearson chi-square minimum discrepancy divided by degrees of freedom (pcmin/df), root mean square error of approximation (rmsea), goodness of fit index (gfi), adjusted goodness of fit index (agfi), normative fit index (nfi), incremental fit index (ifi), and comparative fit index (cfi) were used to determine if the model was well fitted. a two-tailed significance level of α = 0.05 was used. questionnaires this study was designed as a cross-sectional survey using an anonymous questionnaire. respondents were informed of the voluntary nature of their involvement and provided informed consent. to ensure cultural and contextual relevance, we developed the public knowledge, attitude, and preference of hpc scale (p-kaphpcs), specifically for this study (supplementary file 1). the scale was created through a systematic review of international kap studies on hpc [ 19 , 20 , 21 , 22 , 23 , 24 ], followed by a rigorous adaptation and localization process to align with china’s sociocultural landscape and the realities of hpc development. this culturally tailored instrument strengthened the validity and relevance of our findings, ensuring that the measured constructs accurately reflect public perceptions within the chinese context. the scale comprised four sections: (1) 25 demographic and health status items; (2) 12 knowledge items. three items were designed to assess the public’s self-perceived knowledge and access to hpc, with only option percentages calculated. nine items tested the public’s understanding of hpc, yielding a total score ranging from 0 to 9 (1 point for correct ‘true’ responses; ‘false’ or ‘don’t know’ scored 0); (3) 12 attitude items about hpc service content and philosophy (subscale a: attitude toward eol care and arrangements for terminally ill patients. subscale b: personal attitude regarding one’s own eol care). the attitude scale used a 5-point likert scale, with items in subscale a scored from “strongly disagree” 1 to “strongly agree” 5, with items a2 and a6 reverse-scored and adjusted during analysis. items in subscale b were scored from “very unimportant” 1 to “very important” 5; (4) six preference items addressed life-sustaining treatment (lst) decisions, hpc choice, eol care services and location. as these items were not designed to produce a composite score, no total score was calculated. it has demonstrated good reliability and validity, cronbach’s α coefficients for the knowledge scale and attitude scale were 0.881 and 0.818, respectively. the preference scale showed high relevance and significance, with a score of 5, and the coefficient of variation was less than 0.001. data collection to systematically assess the chinese public’s kap for hpc in china, we conducted a nationwide, anonymous, cross-sectional online survey between december 2023 and april 2024. questionnaires were distributed and collected through surveystar (changsha ranxing science and technology, shanghai, china), a widely used chinese platform, yielding 947 valid responses (effective response rate = 98.85%). after age verification, three respondents were found to be under 18 years old; in strict accordance with the study protocol and ethical approval, these three cases were excluded, leaving 944 participants for analysis. the sample covered 26 provinces across eastern, central, and western china, ensuring broad regional representation. to minimize potential bias, all quality-control personnel received centralized training, and a dual, back-to-back quality-control review was implemented throughout the data-collection process. results general demographic and health status information the survey participants were members of the chinese general public, with 734 (77.80%) identifying as female. ages ranged from 18 to 84 years, with a mean of 41.07 ± 15.06 years. the largest income group (48.30%) reported an annual household income of 100,000 to 300,000 yuan. in terms of marital status, 641 (67.90%) were married, and the majority (52.50%) had an undergraduate education (496 participants) (table s.1). knowledge and associated factors the survey indicated that respondents had a good level of knowledge regarding the concept of hpc, with a mean score of 7.47 ± 2.14 and an overall accuracy rate of 83.01%. most items scored above 80.00% (table 1 ), but there were significant gaps in respondents’ understanding of “providing home care (on-site) for eol patients is not part of hpc” (k4, 65.40%) and “hpc encourages people to stop treatment for their incurable illness” (k2, 76.50%). the results showed that 41.10% of the respondents could explain hpc, while 26.20% were aware of it but could not clearly articulate its meaning. additionally, 22.70% had only heard of the concept, and 10.04% had never heard of hpc before. in terms of hpc knowledge sources, health institutions or medical staff were the most common channel through which people learnt about hpc (63.30%), while new media platforms (e.g., wechat, weibo, tiktok, kuai shou, tou tiao, baidu, etc.) became the preferred channel through which the vast majority of respondents wished to obtain information about hpc (67.90%). furthermore, while 9.70% of respondents acquired hpc knowledge through social or community activities, 40.30% believed these should serve as a key channel for dissemination, highlighting differences in preferred dissemination channels (table s.2). table 1 score of public knowledge on hpc full size table statistically significant variables ( p < 0.05) were first identified through one-way analysis. these variables encompassed: age ( p < 0.001), household income ( p = 0.001), family size ( p = 0.003), single-child family ( p = 0.009), primary family decision-maker ( p = 0.007), educational level ( p < 0.001), employment status ( p = 0.009) and occupation ( p < 0.001) (table s.3). then, these variables were included as independent variables, and the total score of hpc knowledge was used as the dependent variable for multivariate linear regression analysis. as depicted in table 2 , educational level ( β = 0.381) and household income ( β = 0.215) were significantly positively associated with hpc knowledge. the model explained 26.0% of the variance in hpc knowledge (r 2 = 0.26). table 2 results of multiple linear regression analyses of knowledge full size table attitude and associated factors the overall mean score rate for attitude was 84.18%. for subscale a (attitude toward eol care and arrangements for terminally ill patients), the mean score was 23.74 ± 2.84, corresponding to a score rate of 79.13%. the top three highest-scoring items, in descending order, were “a1: death is a normal part of living.” (4.75 ± 0.61), “a4: patient should prepare mentally and spiritually for death.” (4.28 ± 0.86), “a3: patient’s own wishes should determine what treatment he/she should receive.” (4.23 ± 0.90). the lowest scoring item was “a5: if patients are totally dependent on another for daily life, it is best not to prolong their life by any means.” (2.73 ± 1.23). the mean score of subscale b (personal attitude regarding one’s own eol care) was 26.77 ± 3.25, with a score rate of 89.45%. the highest-scoring item was “b3: family or friends accompany.” (4.59 ± 0.70), followed by “b2: get the necessary medical and nursing services in a comfortable treatment environment.” (4.58 ± 0.68). the lowest-scoring item was “b4: don’t be a burden on family.” (4.11 ± 1.02) (table 3 ). table 3 score of public hpc attitude full size table public attitude toward arrangements related to death and related arrangement for terminally ill patients were statistically affected by age, with the 50–59 age group having the highest level. this difference was statistically significant ( p < 0.05) (table s.4). preference and associated factors in lst decisions preference, when asked “if you were in a severe condition in which lst could not recover your health, and you might even have to rely on it over long-term to prolong your life, would you like to accept lst?”, 67.80% chose “no”. in hpc choice preference, if the public were diagnosed with a terminal illness, they most commonly preferred to receive appropriate hpc that focuses on comfort rather than necessarily prolonging life (69.90%). this was followed by prolonging life as much as possible, and receiving appropriate hpc at necessary time or at the end of the treatment (24.50%), and lastly, prolonging life as much as possible even with pain, discomfort and suffering (5.60%). if a family member was diagnosed with a terminal illness, the public’s preference for the three options previously mentioned were in the same order, but the latter two options were significantly higher, at 57.20%, 35.60%, and 7.20%, respectively. when asked about their preference for discussing hpc services if diagnosed with a serious or life-threatening illness, 34.10% chose “close to the end of life”, followed by “at diagnosis of the illness” (24.50%), “during treatment for the illness”(22.60%), and to a lesser extent “once treatment has been stopped” (16.00%) and 2.90% for “never”. in preference for eol care location, home care (47.30%) was the most preferred eol location, including professional home care (25.80%) and family-provided home care (21.50%), followed by hpc/eol facilities (45.00%). fewer respondents selected “general hospital (non-hpc unit)” at 4.00%, “care homes or nursing homes” at 2.60%, and “else” at 1.00%. in terms of preferred eol care services, the vast majority (93.40%) selected symptomatic treatment and comfort care for pain relief as the most desired services. this was followed by psychological counseling and support (63.10%) and family and social support services (63.00%). in contrast, only 15.60% chose religious rituals or belief-related services as a preferred component of eol care. the dependent variable utilized in the analysis was the preference for lst. chi-square test was used to identify significant variables (table s.5), which were then included in the binary logistic regression analysis (table s.5). these variables encompassed: gender ( p = 0.025), age ( p = 0.001), occupation ( p = 0.013), history of chronic diseases ( p = 0.019), experience of caring for the dying patient ( p < 0.001), experience of witnessing a patient’s eol process ( p < 0.001), primary family decision-makers ( p = 0.001), and family size ( p = 0.002). the method of assigning values to the above variables was provided in table 4 . as shown in table 5 , gender, occupation, experience of witnessing a patient’s eol process, primary family decision-makers, family size were significant factors influencing lst preference. females showed a lower preference for lst compared to males ( p = 0.003, or = 0.601), enterprise staff showed lower lst preference compared to public sector employees ( p = 0.004, or = 0.556), and those who had experience witnessing a patient’s eol process showed higher lst preference compared to those with no such experience ( p < 0.001, or = 1.758). in addition, when parents were the primary decision makers in the family, they were less likely to choose lst compared to those who made their own decisions ( p = 0.010, or = 1.537). finally, those with family sizes between 4 and 9 members also showed a lower propensity to receive lst compared to those with family sizes of 1 and 2 members ( p = 0.046, or = 1.587). table 4 variable assignment method full size table table 5 results of logistic regression analysis of lst preference full size table structural equation modeling results the model was validated using the maximum likelihood method, and modification indices (mi) were utilized to adjust and refine the model. from sem, the model had a significant fit with the data, pcmin/df = 2.963 < 3, rmsea = 0.046 (90%ci: 0.038–0.053) < 0.06, gfi = 0.970 > 0.9, agfi = 0.956 > 0.9, nfi = 0.954 > 0.9, ifi = 0.969 > 0.9, cfi = 0.969 > 0.9. the final sem diagram is shown in fig. 1 . fig. 1 kap structural equation modeling diagram full size image the path analysis of sem concluded that knowledge had a positive effect on attitude and preference. from the sem diagram and standardized path coefficients, it can be found that the path coefficient of knowledge on attitude was 0.55 (s.e. = 0.418, p < 0.001). that means that the knowledge is higher, and the attitude will be higher. the path coefficient of attitude on preference was − 0.02 (s.e. = 0.010, p = 0.751). in addition, the path coefficient of knowledge on preference was 0.13 (s.e. = 0.097, p < 0.05). in other words, if the level of knowledge is higher, the preference will be higher. discussion this study used the p-kaphpc scale to assess public kap of hpc. results showed an overall positive attitude yet knowledge remains limited and diverse preference. key influencing factors and correlations among kap were also identified. the study explored the kap situation for hpc from the public perspective in chinese society and provided recommendations for the development of hpc that can be used as a reference for countries with the same cultural background. the results indicated that the general public in china exhibited a high level of awareness of hpc, but with limited ability to explain its concept and some misconceptions. over two-thirds of the general public (67.27%) demonstrated awareness of hpc, exceeding the 47.00% awareness rate among shanghai residents (2021) [ 11 ] and the 50.29% rate among hangzhou community residents (2020) [ 18 ]. this suggests that awareness has improved as national hpc policies have been rolled out in recent years, yet it remains below the levels observed in other developed countries [ 25 ]– [ 26 ]. meanwhile, only 41.10% of the public could explain hpc and there was confusion about the distinction between hospice and euthanasia, aligning with the findings of yin et al. [ 27 ], which showed that the public’s knowledge of hpc still requires improvement. sem results showed that accurate knowledge shapes a positive attitude and directly influences preference choices, highlighting the need for targeted education. this study showed that hpc knowledge level increased significantly with educational level and household income, aligning with international findings [ 16 , 28 , 29 , 30 , 31 , 32 ]. these disparities, explained by the knowledge-gap hypothesis, stem from socioeconomic status (ses) shaping information access. higher education equips individuals with superior information-processing skills and privileged channels to accumulate knowledge. meanwhile, higher-income groups, free from cost constraints and situated in resource-rich environments, are more likely to prioritize psychosocial well-being [ 32 ]. these ses-driven knowledge inequities exacerbate health disparities [ 33 ], potentially trapping low-ses populations in a “cognitive poverty cycle” [ 34 ] due to limited health literacy. therefore, policy should go beyond basic information campaigns. given public’s preference for acquiring hpc knowledge through community activities, prioritizing community-based education becomes essential. its accessible, contextualized communication can effectively reduce disparities. this aligns with the 2023 world hpc day theme, “compassionate communities together for palliative care”, emphasizes community advocacy in overcoming cultural barriers to hpc. additionally, medical professionals, as the primary source of hpc knowledge for the public, should take on greater responsibility for education and awareness. therefore, it is essential to provide training to enhance their expertise and communication skills, enabling them to convey clear hpc knowledge based on the public’s trust in them. since 2016, the u.s. centers for medicare and medicaid services have recognized acp discussions as a distinct reimbursable service. physicians can receive payment if they provide at least 30 min of face-to-face communication with patients or their families and complete the required documentation, which has effectively encouraged healthcare professionals to initiate hpc conversations [ 35 ]. in recent years, china has also begun to introduce supportive policies and practices. hpc has been formally added to the national health system as a new healthcare service item, with acp explicitly listed among its thirteen core elements [ 36 ]. at the provincial level, almost all pilot areas have established hpc training bases that provide regular, systematic training for healthcare professionals, while also enhancing public awareness through initiatives such as hpc awareness weeks and free consultation events. these measures not only offer policy and practical support for providers to engage in hpc education, but also lay the groundwork for the broader societal integration of hpc principles. the study revealed that the public generally holds a favorable attitude toward the principles and content of hpc (84.18%), but significant cultural and ethical conflicts arise in practice. while respondents widely accepted the idea that death is a normal part of life, they were less inclined to agree with the notion that “if patients are completely dependent on others for daily life, it is best not to prolong their lives by any means”. this disparity underscores the tension between filial traditions and quality-of-life perspectives, as family obligations to prolong life at all costs often take precedence over individual autonomy. additionally, respondents were more likely to choose comfort-oriented hpc for themselves (69.90%) than for their family members (57.00%), reflecting the strong influence of family ethics and the cultural importance of filial responsibility in decision-making. despite supporting the principle of honoring patients’ preferences, respondents showed weaker support for direct communication with physicians, suggesting that informed consent remains aspirational rather than implemented in practice. sem results confirmed that a positive attitude did not significantly translate into actual preferences. in china’s family-oriented culture, although the public agrees with the hpc concept, family ethics, filial piety, and social responsibility often prevent attitudes from turning into behavior, posing a challenge to hpc promotion. this phenomenon can be attributed to two aspects. firstly, under the influence of traditional family concepts, medical decision-making is often dominated by the family decision-maker, and patients may form the inertia of “family members do it for them”. secondly, most patients leave medical decision-making to the family decision-maker, or put their family’s needs above their own wishes [ 37 ]. to effectively implement hpc, policymakers must first enact legal safeguards for acp and ad to protect patient autonomy, establishing them as primary medical orders superseding familial conflicts. second, adapting the stepwise communication protocol from the u.s. spirit intervention [ 38 ] can develop culturally congruent decision-making tools that foster intra-family consensus. empirical evidence showed that the principles of hpc can coexist with filial piety [ 39 ]. when a dignified death is seen as an act of modern filial piety instead of a betrayal of it, traditional ethics and modern hpc can finally align. the results showed that individuals who had witnessed the death of terminally ill patients were more likely to decline lst, consistent with jing et al. [ 24 ]. this is likely because death-related experiences prompt reflections on the meaning of life. observing the pain and suffering of patients may shift their focus toward preserving dignity and improving quality of life, fostering a more positive preference for hpc [ 40 ]. this phenomenon provides valuable insights into death education practices, which can be promoted by creating safe and supportive environments, such as moderately open ward visits and encouraging the sharing of caregiving experiences. these initiatives can facilitate observation, reflection, and dialogue about the dying process. families with more than 3 persons had a significantly lower preference for lst compared to families with 1–2 persons. this outcome challenges the prevailing view that greater family support inevitably leads to more aggressive care [ 41 ], suggesting that larger families may foster their own distinct decision style and support network. such families typically have access to a wider pool of informal caregivers, reducing the perceived need for prolonged, technology-driven interventions, and making comfort-oriented hpc a more realistic first choice. the broader network of relationships also introduces multiple perspectives, shared deliberation, and diffused responsibility, which eases the emotional burden on any single decision-maker and steers choices toward the patient’s overall well-being [ 42 ]. in contrast, small nuclear families often face limited resources and heightened isolation when making eol decisions [ 43 ]– [ 44 ], factors that can increase their reliance on medical technology. this study also revealed a growing public preference for home-based hpc, with desired services including symptom management, psychological support, and family and social support. these preferences underscore the need for a hybrid “home-based and community” care model that integrates family networks with professional services [ 45 ]. this balanced approach, which avoids over-reliance on family caregiving while maintaining family ties, aligns with china’s social context. however, the implementation of this service still faces practical barriers. first, the limited availability of full-time hpc professionals at the primary level limits service accessibility. second, home-based services are not yet fully covered by medical insurance, which results in high out-of-pocket costs for patients. third, insufficient public awareness of hpc continues to impede its uptake [ 46 ]. in response, national policies have begun to address these challenges by gradually incorporating home-based hpc into the health insurance reimbursement system and emphasizing the establishment of a service network that links community, home-based, and institutional care [ 47 ]– [ 48 ]. building on these initiatives, we recommend increasing financial investment in home-based hpc, strengthening community resource integration, expanding the grassroots medical teams, and conducting systematic public education initiatives. enterprise employees demonstrated a lower preference for lst than public-sector employees. the latter, typically employed within the civil service or other publicly funded institutions, benefit from stable employment and comprehensive welfare coverage [ 49 ]. such conditions appear to cultivate a taken-for-granted trust in the conventional medical paradigm. conversely, a corporate culture prioritizing competition and efficiency heightens enterprise employees cost and risk sensitivity. combined with employment instability, which erodes future security, this dual pressure makes employees confronting chronically diminished quality of life more likely to adopt a pragmatic loss-minimization mindset. this subsequently inclines them to refuse lst. these findings suggest that occupationally shaped daily experiences may ultimately be transformed into an important basis for individuals’ eol choices. limitation there were several limitations in our study. first, this is a cross-sectional study, showing only correlations but no causal relationship between kap and influencing factors. second, the kap of the public for hpc may change over time, but cross-sectional studies are unable to capture such dynamic changes. third, there may be some bias in the representativeness of the sample. considering the sensitivity of the topic and ethical issues, an online survey was designed in this study, and the form of voluntary participation may have brought about bias in the sample, while the respondents attracted in this way may themselves have a higher degree of identification with the hpc topic, leading to biased results. however, at a time when hpc in china is still in its infancy, systematic evaluations from a public perspective are extremely scarce; the sensitivity of the topic and the difficulty of judging it further exacerbate the research gap. despite the biased sample in this study, the results provide preliminary data and hypotheses for subsequent research in this area. future studies can enhance the representativeness and causal inference of the sample through a mixed sampling strategy combining multi-temporal longitudinal tracking, online and offline, as well as an anonymous randomized design, in order to obtain more robust and comprehensive conclusions. conclusion this study revealed the current status and challenges of public kap of hpc. although the public generally has a positive attitude toward hpc, the quality of the public knowledge of hpc needs to be improved and preference varies. education level and household income were associated with knowledge, while attitude was influenced by education level and age. several factors were found to affect public preference, with knowledge playing a positive role in shaping both attitude and preference. traditional cultural concepts and ethics to some extent bring conflict in hpc decision making. therefore, it is recommended to enhance hpc education, reinforce legal protection of acp and ad, introduce culturally appropriate communication tools for family consensus, and establish a home-community mixed care model. these measures are expected to foster greater public participation in hpc. data availability data is available from the corresponding author on reasonable request. abbreviations hpc: hospice and palliative

with global population aging and the rising burden of chronic non-communicable diseases, there is growing recognition of the need for a more compassionate and patient-centered approach to end-of-life (eol) care [ 1 ]. hospice and palliative care (hpc) has been widely acknowledged as a pivotal intervention to enhance the quality of life for terminally ill patients and their families. in china, despite the implementation of three rounds of hpc pilot programs since 2017, the actual utilization remains remarkably low, with bed occupancy rates in some areas falling below 20% [ 2 ]. within china’s unique sociocultural context, several deeply rooted beliefs—such as the association of filial piety with life-prolonging interventions, the cultural taboo surrounding death-related discussions, and the prevailing view that “better a bad life than a good death”—hinder meaningful engagement with hpc. these factors constrain the effectiveness of hpc, even where services are adequately available. consequently, understanding the public’s knowledge, attitude, and preference (kap) regarding hpc becomes critically important to identify culturally specific barriers and inform context-sensitive strategies to promote service uptake. international studies have consistently highlighted the importance of public kap toward hpc in its successful adoption [ 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 ]. however, research in china has primarily focused on the kap of medical professionals and terminally ill patients, or is limited to specific regions and groups such as the elderly, community residents, and chronic disease patients, which restricts capturing the diverse perspectives of the general public [ 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 ]. furthermore, several studies have concentrated on sub-topics such as advance care planning (acp) and advance directives (ad), yet these have not been integrated into the broader framework of hpc services. as a result, this has led to a fragmented understanding of the public’s genuine needs and the barriers they face [ 12 , 13 , 14 ]. moreover, survey instruments, which were adapted from those designed for medical professionals, have not undergone adequate cultural adjustments. this hampers their ability to accurately capture the unique perspectives of the general public within their specific cultural context. finally, existing research fails to provide a comprehensive exploration of the interrelationships among the three components of kap, along with the pathways through which they influence each other [ 15 , 16 , 17 , 18 ]. to bridge the gap, this study focuses on the public perspective, providing a comprehensive assessment of the kap of the general public across china using a culturally adapted and locally validated kap scale. by exploring key influencing factors and potential barriers, this study aims to foster greater public engagement with hpc and improve the quality of eol care in china. ultimately, it seeks to generate evidence-based insight to inform targeted interventions for hpc development, contributing to its broader integration into the healthcare system and societal discourse. methods statistical methods statistical analyses were performed using ibm spss statistics 27.0 (ibm corporation, armonk, ny). descriptive statistics were used to analyze the respondents’ demographic, health status information and kap scores. continuous variables were described by mean ± standard deviation (sd), while categorical variables were presented as frequency and percentages. one-way analyses and regression analyses were used to explore the factors that influence kap. structural equation modeling (sem) was constructed to explore the causal relationship between observed and latent variables, with kap as latent variables and their secondary dimensions as observed variables in the hypothetical model. fit indices such as pearson chi-square minimum discrepancy divided by degrees of freedom (pcmin/df), root mean square error of approximation (rmsea), goodness of fit index (gfi), adjusted goodness of fit index (agfi), normative fit index (nfi), incremental fit index (ifi), and comparative fit index (cfi) were used to determine if the model was well fitted. a two-tailed significance level of α = 0.05 was used. questionnaires this study was designed as a cross-sectional survey using an anonymous questionnaire. respondents were informed of the voluntary nature of their involvement and provided informed consent. to ensure cultural and contextual relevance, we developed the public knowledge, attitude, and preference of hpc scale (p-kaphpcs), specifically for this study (supplementary file 1). the scale was created through a systematic review of international kap studies on hpc [ 19 , 20 , 21 , 22 , 23 , 24 ], followed by a rigorous adaptation and localization process to align with china’s sociocultural landscape and the realities of hpc development. this culturally tailored instrument strengthened the validity and relevance of our findings, ensuring that the measured constructs accurately reflect public perceptions within the chinese context. the scale comprised four sections: (1) 25 demographic and health status items; (2) 12 knowledge items. three items were designed to assess the public’s self-perceived knowledge and access to hpc, with only option percentages calculated. nine items tested the public’s understanding of hpc, yielding a total score ranging from 0 to 9 (1 point for correct ‘true’ responses; ‘false’ or ‘don’t know’ scored 0); (3) 12 attitude items about hpc service content and philosophy (subscale a: attitude toward eol care and arrangements for terminally ill patients. subscale b: personal attitude regarding one’s own eol care). the attitude scale used a 5-point likert scale, with items in subscale a scored from “strongly disagree” 1 to “strongly agree” 5, with items a2 and a6 reverse-scored and adjusted during analysis. items in subscale b were scored from “very unimportant” 1 to “very important” 5; (4) six preference items addressed life-sustaining treatment (lst) decisions, hpc choice, eol care services and location. as these items were not designed to produce a composite score, no total score was calculated. it has demonstrated good reliability and validity, cronbach’s α coefficients for the knowledge scale and attitude scale were 0.881 and 0.818, respectively. the preference scale showed high relevance and significance, with a score of 5, and the coefficient of variation was less than 0.001. data collection to systematically assess the chinese public’s kap for hpc in china, we conducted a nationwide, anonymous, cross-sectional online survey between december 2023 and april 2024. questionnaires were distributed and collected through surveystar (changsha ranxing science and technology, shanghai, china), a widely used chinese platform, yielding 947 valid responses (effective response rate = 98.85%). after age verification, three respondents were found to be under 18 years old; in strict accordance with the study protocol and ethical approval, these three cases were excluded, leaving 944 participants for analysis. the sample covered 26 provinces across eastern, central, and western china, ensuring broad regional representation. to minimize potential bias, all quality-control personnel received centralized training, and a dual, back-to-back quality-control review was implemented throughout the data-collection process. results general demographic and health status information the survey participants were members of the chinese general public, with 734 (77.80%) identifying as female. ages ranged from 18 to 84 years, with a mean of 41.07 ± 15.06 years. the largest income group (48.30%) reported an annual household income of 100,000 to 300,000 yuan. in terms of marital status, 641 (67.90%) were married, and the majority (52.50%) had an undergraduate education (496 participants) (table s.1). knowledge and associated factors the survey indicated that respondents had a good level of knowledge regarding the concept of hpc, with a mean score of 7.47 ± 2.14 and an overall accuracy rate of 83.01%. most items scored above 80.00% (table 1 ), but there were significant gaps in respondents’ understanding of “providing home care (on-site) for eol patients is not part of hpc” (k4, 65.40%) and “hpc encourages people to stop treatment for their incurable illness” (k2, 76.50%). the results showed that 41.10% of the respondents could explain hpc, while 26.20% were aware of it but could not clearly articulate its meaning. additionally, 22.70% had only heard of the concept, and 10.04% had never heard of hpc before. in terms of hpc knowledge sources, health institutions or medical staff were the most common channel through which people learnt about hpc (63.30%), while new media platforms (e.g., wechat, weibo, tiktok, kuai shou, tou tiao, baidu, etc.) became the preferred channel through which the vast majority of respondents wished to obtain information about hpc (67.90%). furthermore, while 9.70% of respondents acquired hpc knowledge through social or community activities, 40.30% believed these should serve as a key channel for dissemination, highlighting differences in preferred dissemination channels (table s.2). table 1 score of public knowledge on hpc full size table statistically significant variables ( p < 0.05) were first identified through one-way analysis. these variables encompassed: age ( p < 0.001), household income ( p = 0.001), family size ( p = 0.003), single-child family ( p = 0.009), primary family decision-maker ( p = 0.007), educational level ( p < 0.001), employment status ( p = 0.009) and occupation ( p < 0.001) (table s.3). then, these variables were included as independent variables, and the total score of hpc knowledge was used as the dependent variable for multivariate linear regression analysis. as depicted in table 2 , educational level ( β = 0.381) and household income ( β = 0.215) were significantly positively associated with hpc knowledge. the model explained 26.0% of the variance in hpc knowledge (r 2 = 0.26). table 2 results of multiple linear regression analyses of knowledge full size table attitude and associated factors the overall mean score rate for attitude was 84.18%. for subscale a (attitude toward eol care and arrangements for terminally ill patients), the mean score was 23.74 ± 2.84, corresponding to a score rate of 79.13%. the top three highest-scoring items, in descending order, were “a1: death is a normal part of living.” (4.75 ± 0.61), “a4: patient should prepare mentally and spiritually for death.” (4.28 ± 0.86), “a3: patient’s own wishes should determine what treatment he/she should receive.” (4.23 ± 0.90). the lowest scoring item was “a5: if patients are totally dependent on another for daily life, it is best not to prolong their life by any means.” (2.73 ± 1.23). the mean score of subscale b (personal attitude regarding one’s own eol care) was 26.77 ± 3.25, with a score rate of 89.45%. the highest-scoring item was “b3: family or friends accompany.” (4.59 ± 0.70), followed by “b2: get the necessary medical and nursing services in a comfortable treatment environment.” (4.58 ± 0.68). the lowest-scoring item was “b4: don’t be a burden on family.” (4.11 ± 1.02) (table 3 ). table 3 score of public hpc attitude full size table public attitude toward arrangements related to death and related arrangement for terminally ill patients were statistically affected by age, with the 50–59 age group having the highest level. this difference was statistically significant ( p < 0.05) (table s.4). preference and associated factors in lst decisions preference, when asked “if you were in a severe condition in which lst could not recover your health, and you might even have to rely on it over long-term to prolong your life, would you like to accept lst?”, 67.80% chose “no”. in hpc choice preference, if the public were diagnosed with a terminal illness, they most commonly preferred to receive appropriate hpc that focuses on comfort rather than necessarily prolonging life (69.90%). this was followed by prolonging life as much as possible, and receiving appropriate hpc at necessary time or at the end of the treatment (24.50%), and lastly, prolonging life as much as possible even with pain, discomfort and suffering (5.60%). if a family member was diagnosed with a terminal illness, the public’s preference for the three options previously mentioned were in the same order, but the latter two options were significantly higher, at 57.20%, 35.60%, and 7.20%, respectively. when asked about their preference for discussing hpc services if diagnosed with a serious or life-threatening illness, 34.10% chose “close to the end of life”, followed by “at diagnosis of the illness” (24.50%), “during treatment for the illness”(22.60%), and to a lesser extent “once treatment has been stopped” (16.00%) and 2.90% for “never”. in preference for eol care location, home care (47.30%) was the most preferred eol location, including professional home care (25.80%) and family-provided home care (21.50%), followed by hpc/eol facilities (45.00%). fewer respondents selected “general hospital (non-hpc unit)” at 4.00%, “care homes or nursing homes” at 2.60%, and “else” at 1.00%. in terms of preferred eol care services, the vast majority (93.40%) selected symptomatic treatment and comfort care for pain relief as the most desired services. this was followed by psychological counseling and support (63.10%) and family and social support services (63.00%). in contrast, only 15.60% chose religious rituals or belief-related services as a preferred component of eol care. the dependent variable utilized in the analysis was the preference for lst. chi-square test was used to identify significant variables (table s.5), which were then included in the binary logistic regression analysis (table s.5). these variables encompassed: gender ( p = 0.025), age ( p = 0.001), occupation ( p = 0.013), history of chronic diseases ( p = 0.019), experience of caring for the dying patient ( p < 0.001), experience of witnessing a patient’s eol process ( p < 0.001), primary family decision-makers ( p = 0.001), and family size ( p = 0.002). the method of assigning values to the above variables was provided in table 4 . as shown in table 5 , gender, occupation, experience of witnessing a patient’s eol process, primary family decision-makers, family size were significant factors influencing lst preference. females showed a lower preference for lst compared to males ( p = 0.003, or = 0.601), enterprise staff showed lower lst preference compared to public sector employees ( p = 0.004, or = 0.556), and those who had experience witnessing a patient’s eol process showed higher lst preference compared to those with no such experience ( p < 0.001, or = 1.758). in addition, when parents were the primary decision makers in the family, they were less likely to choose lst compared to those who made their own decisions ( p = 0.010, or = 1.537). finally, those with family sizes between 4 and 9 members also showed a lower propensity to receive lst compared to those with family sizes of 1 and 2 members ( p = 0.046, or = 1.587). table 4 variable assignment method full size table table 5 results of logistic regression analysis of lst preference full size table structural equation modeling results the model was validated using the maximum likelihood method, and modification indices (mi) were utilized to adjust and refine the model. from sem, the model had a significant fit with the data, pcmin/df = 2.963 <

structural equation modeling diagram full size image the path analysis of sem concluded that knowledge had a positive effect on attitude and preference. from the sem diagram and standardized path coefficients, it can be found that the path coefficient of knowledge on attitude was 0.55 (s.e. = 0.418, p < 0.001). that means that the knowledge is higher, and the attitude will be higher. the path coefficient of attitude on preference was − 0.02 (s.e. = 0.010, p = 0.751). in addition, the path coefficient of knowledge on preference was 0.13 (s.e. = 0.097, p < 0.05). in other words, if the level of knowledge is higher, the preference will be higher. discussion this study used the p-kaphpc scale to assess public kap of hpc. results showed an overall positive attitude yet knowledge remains limited and diverse preference. key influencing factors and correlations among kap were also identified. the study explored the kap situation for hpc from the public perspective in chinese society and provided recommendations for the development of hpc that can be used as a reference for countries with the same cultural background. the results indicated that the general public in china exhibited a high level of awareness of hpc, but with limited ability to explain its concept and some misconceptions. over two-thirds of the general public (67.27%) demonstrated awareness of hpc, exceeding the 47.00% awareness rate among shanghai residents (2021) [ 11 ] and the 50.29% rate among hangzhou community residents (2020) [ 18 ]. this suggests that awareness has improved as national hpc policies have been rolled out in recent years, yet it remains below the levels observed in other developed countries [ 25 ]– [ 26 ]. meanwhile, only 41.10% of the public could explain hpc and there was confusion about the distinction between hospice and euthanasia, aligning with the findings of yin et al. [ 27 ], which showed that the public’s knowledge of hpc still requires improvement. sem results showed that accurate knowledge shapes a positive attitude and directly influences preference choices, highlighting the need for targeted education. this study showed that hpc knowledge level increased significantly with educational level and household income, aligning with international findings [ 16 , 28 , 29 , 30 , 31 , 32 ]. these disparities, explained by the knowledge-gap hypothesis, stem from socioeconomic status (ses) shaping information access. higher education equips individuals with superior information-processing skills and privileged channels to accumulate knowledge. meanwhile, higher-income groups, free from cost constraints and situated in resource-rich environments, are more likely to prioritize psychosocial well-being [ 32 ]. these ses-driven knowledge inequities exacerbate health disparities [ 33 ], potentially trapping low-ses populations in a “cognitive poverty cycle” [ 34 ] due to limited health literacy. therefore, policy should go beyond basic information campaigns. given public’s preference for acquiring hpc knowledge through community activities, prioritizing community-based education becomes essential. its accessible, contextualized communication can effectively reduce disparities. this aligns with the 2023 world hpc day theme, “compassionate communities together for palliative care”, emphasizes community advocacy in overcoming cultural barriers to hpc. additionally, medical professionals, as the primary source of hpc knowledge for the public, should take on greater responsibility for education and awareness. therefore, it is essential to provide training to enhance their expertise and communication skills, enabling them to convey clear hpc knowledge based on the public’s trust in them. since 2016, the u.s. centers for medicare and medicaid services have recognized acp discussions as a distinct reimbursable service. physicians can receive payment if they provide at least 30 min of face-to-face communication with patients or their families and complete the required documentation, which has effectively encouraged healthcare professionals to initiate hpc conversations [ 35 ]. in recent years, china has also begun to introduce supportive policies and practices. hpc has been formally added to the national health system as a new healthcare service item, with acp explicitly listed among its thirteen core elements [ 36 ]. at the provincial level, almost all pilot areas have established hpc training bases that provide regular, systematic training for healthcare professionals, while also enhancing public awareness through initiatives such as hpc awareness weeks and free consultation events. these measures not only offer policy and practical support for providers to engage in hpc education, but also lay the groundwork for the broader societal integration of hpc principles. the study revealed that the public generally holds a favorable attitude toward the principles and content of hpc (84.18%), but significant cultural and ethical conflicts arise in practice. while respondents widely accepted the idea that death is a normal part of life, they were less inclined to agree with the notion that “if patients are completely dependent on others for daily life, it is best not to prolong their lives by any means”. this disparity underscores the tension between filial traditions and quality-of-life perspectives, as family obligations to prolong life at all costs often take precedence over individual autonomy. additionally, respondents were more likely to choose comfort-oriented hpc for themselves (69.90%) than for their family members (57.00%), reflecting the strong influence of family ethics and the cultural importance of filial responsibility in decision-making. despite supporting the principle of honoring patients’ preferences, respondents showed weaker support for direct communication with physicians, suggesting that informed consent remains aspirational rather than implemented in practice. sem results confirmed that a positive attitude did not significantly translate into actual preferences. in china’s family-oriented culture, although the public agrees with the hpc concept, family ethics, filial piety, and social responsibility often prevent attitudes from turning into behavior, posing a challenge to hpc promotion. this phenomenon can be attributed to two aspects. firstly, under the influence of traditional family concepts, medical decision-making is often dominated by the family decision-maker, and patients may form the inertia of “family members do it for them”. secondly, most patients leave medical decision-making to the family decision-maker, or put their family’s needs above their own wishes [ 37 ]. to effectively implement hpc, policymakers must first enact legal safeguards for acp and ad to protect patient autonomy, establishing them as primary medical orders superseding familial conflicts. second, adapting the stepwise communication protocol from the u.s. spirit intervention [ 38 ] can develop culturally congruent decision-making tools that foster intra-family consensus. empirical evidence showed that the principles of hpc can coexist with filial piety [ 39 ]. when a dignified death is seen as an act of modern filial piety instead of a betrayal of it, traditional ethics and modern hpc can finally align. the results showed that individuals who had witnessed the death of terminally ill patients were more likely to decline lst, consistent with jing et al. [ 24 ]. this is likely because death-related experiences prompt reflections on the meaning of life. observing the pain and suffering of patients may shift their focus toward preserving dignity and improving quality of life, fostering a more positive preference for hpc [ 40 ]. this phenomenon provides valuable insights into death education practices, which can be promoted by creating safe and supportive environments, such as moderately open ward visits and encouraging the sharing of caregiving experiences. these initiatives can facilitate observation, reflection, and dialogue about the dying process. families with more than 3 persons had a significantly lower preference for lst compared to families with 1–2 persons. this outcome challenges the prevailing view that greater family support inevitably leads to more aggressive care [ 41 ], suggesting that larger families may foster their own distinct decision style and support network. such families typically have access to a wider pool of informal caregivers, reducing the perceived need for prolonged, technology-driven interventions, and making comfort-oriented hpc a more realistic first choice. the broader network of relationships also introduces multiple perspectives, shared deliberation, and diffused responsibility, which eases the emotional burden on any single decision-maker and steers choices toward the patient’s overall well-being [ 42 ]. in contrast, small nuclear families often face limited resources and heightened isolation when making eol decisions [ 43 ]– [ 44 ], factors that can increase their reliance on medical technology. this study also revealed a growing public preference for home-based hpc, with desired services including symptom management, psychological support, and family and social support. these preferences underscore the need for a hybrid “home-based and community” care model that integrates family networks with professional services [ 45 ]. this balanced approach, which avoids over-reliance on family caregiving while maintaining family ties, aligns with china’s social context. however, the implementation of this service still faces practical barriers. first, the limited availability of full-time hpc professionals at the primary level limits service accessibility. second, home-based services are not yet fully covered by medical insurance, which results in high out-of-pocket costs for patients. third, insufficient public awareness of hpc continues to impede its uptake [ 46 ]. in response, national policies have begun to address these challenges by gradually incorporating home-based hpc into the health insurance reimbursement system and emphasizing the establishment of a service network that links community, home-based, and institutional care [ 47 ]– [ 48 ]. building on these initiatives, we recommend increasing financial investment in home-based hpc, strengthening community resource integration, expanding the grassroots medical teams, and conducting systematic public education initiatives. enterprise employees demonstrated a lower preference for lst than public-sector employees. the latter, typically employed within the civil service or other publicly funded institutions, benefit from stable employment and comprehensive welfare coverage [ 49 ]. such conditions appear to cultivate a taken-for-granted trust in the conventional medical paradigm. conversely, a corporate culture prioritizing competition and efficiency heightens enterprise employees cost and risk sensitivity. combined with employment instability, which erodes future security, this dual pressure makes employees confronting chronically diminished quality of life more likely to adopt a pragmatic loss-minimization mindset. this subsequently inclines them to refuse lst. these findings suggest that occupationally shaped daily experiences may ultimately be transformed into an important basis for individuals’ eol choices. limitation there were several limitations in our study. first, this is a cross-sectional study, showing only correlations but no causal relationship between kap and influencing factors. second, the kap of the public for hpc may change over time, but cross-sectional studies are unable to capture such dynamic changes. third, there may be some bias in the representativeness of the sample. considering the sensitivity of the topic and ethical issues, an online survey was designed in this study, and the form of voluntary participation may have brought about bias in the sample, while the respondents attracted in this way may themselves have a higher degree of identification with the hpc topic, leading to biased results. however, at a time when hpc in china is still in its infancy, systematic evaluations from a public perspective are extremely scarce; the sensitivity of the topic and the difficulty of judging it further exacerbate the research gap. despite the biased sample in this study, the results provide preliminary data and hypotheses for subsequent research in this area. future studies can enhance the representativeness and causal inference of the sample through a mixed sampling strategy combining multi-temporal longitudinal tracking, online and offline, as well as an anonymous randomized design, in order to obtain more robust and comprehensive conclusions. conclusion this study revealed the current status and challenges of public kap of hpc. although the public generally has a positive attitude toward hpc, the quality of the public knowledge of hpc needs to be improved and preference varies. education level and household income were associated with knowledge, while attitude was influenced by education level and age. several factors were found to affect public preference, with knowledge playing a positive role in shaping both attitude and preference. traditional cultural concepts and ethics to some extent bring conflict in hpc decision making. therefore, it is recommended to enhance hpc education, reinforce legal protection of acp and ad, introduce culturally appropriate communication tools for family consensus, and establish a home-community mixed care model. these measures are expected to foster greater public participation in hpc. data availability data is available from the corresponding author on reasonable request. abbreviations hpc: hospice and palliative

this cross-sectional study assessed public kap using the culturally adapted public knowledge, attitude, and preference of hpc scale (p-kaphpcs). regression analysis was applied to identify factors associated with kap. a structural equation model was constructed to test their interrelationship. results among all the respondents, the mean score for hpc knowledge was 7.47 ± 2.14, with 41.10% of the respondents could explain hpc. educational level and household income were associated factors of knowledge ( p < 0.05). the overall attitude mean score rate was 84.18%. public attitude toward end-of-life (eol) arrangements for terminally ill patients was significantly influenced by age, attitude toward one’s own eol care were affected by educational level ( p < 0.05). the majority (67.80%) declined life-sustaining treatment (lst), with preference linked to gender, occupation, experience of witnessing a patient’s eol process, primary family decision-makers, and family size ( p < 0.05). most respondents (47.30%) preferred home as the place for the eol care. structural equation modeling analysis showed that knowledge was positively associated with attitude ( β = 4.97, p < 0.001) and knowledge was positively associated with preference ( β = 0.22, p < 0.001). conclusions the public attitude toward hpc is generally positive, though there is a need to improve the quality of public knowledge, and preference varies. knowledge has a positive influence on both attitude and preference. traditional cultural values and ethics sometimes create conflicts in hpc decision-making. therefore, it is recommended to strengthen hpc education, enhance legal protections for advance care planning (acp) and advance directives (ad), introduce culturally appropriate family consensus communication tools, and establish a home-community hybrid care model. peer review reports introduction with global population aging and the rising burden of chronic non-communicable diseases, there is growing recognition of the need for a more compassionate and patient-centered approach to end-of-life (eol) care [ 1 ]. hospice and palliative care (hpc) has been widely acknowledged as a pivotal intervention to enhance the quality of life for terminally ill patients and their families. in china, despite the implementation of three rounds of hpc pilot programs since 2017, the actual utilization remains remarkably low, with bed occupancy rates in some areas falling below 20% [ 2 ]. within china’s unique sociocultural context, several deeply rooted beliefs—such as the association of filial piety with life-prolonging interventions, the cultural taboo surrounding death-related discussions, and the prevailing view that “better a bad life than a good death”—hinder meaningful engagement with hpc. these factors constrain the effectiveness of hpc, even where services are adequately available. consequently, understanding the public’s knowledge, attitude, and preference (kap) regarding hpc becomes critically important to identify culturally specific barriers and inform context-sensitive strategies to promote service uptake. international studies have consistently highlighted the importance of public kap toward hpc in its successful adoption [ 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 ]. however, research in china has primarily focused on the kap of medical professionals and terminally ill patients, or is limited to specific regions and groups such as the elderly, community residents, and chronic disease patients, which restricts capturing the diverse perspectives of the general public [ 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 ]. furthermore, several studies have concentrated on sub-topics such as advance care planning (acp) and advance directives (ad), yet these have not been integrated into the broader framework of hpc services. as a result, this has led to a fragmented understanding of the public’s genuine needs and the barriers they face [ 12 , 13 , 14 ]. moreover, survey instruments, which were adapted from those designed for medical professionals, have not undergone adequate cultural adjustments. this hampers their ability to accurately capture the unique perspectives of the general public within their specific cultural context. finally, existing research fails to provide a comprehensive exploration of the interrelationships among the three components of kap, along with the pathways through which they influence each other [ 15 , 16 , 17 , 18 ]. to bridge the gap, this study focuses on the public perspective, providing a comprehensive assessment of the kap of the general public across china using a culturally adapted and locally validated kap scale. by exploring key influencing factors and potential barriers, this study aims to foster greater public engagement with hpc and improve the quality of eol care in china. ultimately, it seeks to generate evidence-based insight to inform targeted interventions for hpc development, contributing to its broader integration into the healthcare system and societal discourse. methods statistical methods statistical analyses were performed using ibm spss statistics 27.0 (ibm corporation, armonk, ny). descriptive statistics were used to analyze the respondents’ demographic, health status information and kap scores. continuous variables were described by mean ± standard deviation (sd), while categorical variables were presented as frequency and percentages. one-way analyses and regression analyses were used to explore the factors that influence kap. structural equation modeling (sem) was constructed to explore the causal relationship between observed and latent variables, with kap as latent variables and their secondary dimensions as observed variables in the hypothetical model. fit indices such as pearson chi-square minimum discrepancy divided by degrees of freedom (pcmin/df), root mean square error of approximation (rmsea), goodness of fit index (gfi), adjusted goodness of fit index (agfi), normative fit index (nfi), incremental fit index (ifi), and comparative fit index (cfi) were used to determine if the model was well fitted. a two-tailed significance level of α = 0.05 was used. questionnaires this study was designed as a cross-sectional survey using an anonymous questionnaire. respondents were informed of the voluntary nature of their involvement and provided informed consent. to ensure cultural and contextual relevance, we developed the public knowledge, attitude, and preference of hpc scale (p-kaphpcs), specifically for this study (supplementary file 1). the scale was created through a systematic review of international kap studies on hpc [ 19 , 20 , 21 , 22 , 23 , 24 ], followed by a rigorous adaptation and localization process to align with china’s sociocultural landscape and the realities of hpc development. this culturally tailored instrument strengthened the validity and relevance of our findings, ensuring that the measured constructs accurately reflect public perceptions within the chinese context. the scale comprised four sections: (1) 25 demographic and health status items; (2) 12 knowledge items. three items were designed to assess the public’s self-perceived knowledge and access to hpc, with only option percentages calculated. nine items tested the public’s understanding of hpc, yielding a total score ranging from 0 to 9 (1 point for correct ‘true’ responses; ‘false’ or ‘don’t know’ scored 0); (3) 12 attitude items about hpc service content and philosophy (subscale a: attitude toward eol care and arrangements for terminally ill patients. subscale b: personal attitude regarding one’s own eol care). the attitude scale used a 5-point likert scale, with items in subscale a scored from “strongly disagree” 1 to “strongly agree” 5, with items a2 and a6 reverse-scored and adjusted during analysis. items in subscale b were scored from “very unimportant” 1 to “very important” 5; (4) six preference items addressed life-sustaining treatment (lst) decisions, hpc choice, eol care services and location. as these items were not designed to produce a composite score, no total score was calculated. it has demonstrated good reliability and validity, cronbach’s α coefficients for the knowledge scale and attitude scale were 0.881 and 0.818, respectively. the preference scale showed high relevance and significance, with a score of 5, and the coefficient of variation was less than 0.001. data collection to systematically assess the chinese public’s kap for hpc in china, we conducted a nationwide, anonymous, cross-sectional online survey between december 2023 and april 2024. questionnaires were distributed and collected through surveystar (changsha ranxing science and technology, shanghai, china), a widely used chinese platform, yielding 947 valid responses (effective response rate = 98.85%). after age verification, three respondents were found to be under 18 years old; in strict accordance with the study protocol and ethical approval, these three cases were excluded, leaving 944 participants for analysis. the sample covered 26 provinces across eastern, central, and western china, ensuring broad regional representation. to minimize potential bias, all quality-control personnel received centralized training, and a dual, back-to-back quality-control review was implemented throughout the data-collection process. results general demographic and health status information the survey participants were members of the chinese general public, with 734 (77.80%) identifying as female. ages ranged from 18 to 84 years, with a mean of 41.07 ± 15.06 years. the largest income group (48.30%) reported an annual household income of 100,000 to 300,000 yuan. in terms of marital status, 641 (67.90%) were married, and the majority (52.50%) had an undergraduate education (496 participants) (table s.1). knowledge and associated factors the survey indicated that respondents had a good level of knowledge regarding the concept of hpc, with a mean score of 7.47 ± 2.14 and an overall accuracy rate of 83.01%. most items scored above 80.00% (table 1 ), but there were significant gaps in respondents’ understanding of “providing home care (on-site) for eol patients is not part of hpc” (k4, 65.40%) and “hpc encourages people to stop treatment for their incurable illness” (k2, 76.50%). the results showed that 41.10% of the respondents could explain hpc, while 26.20% were aware of it but could not clearly articulate its meaning. additionally, 22.70% had only heard of the concept, and 10.04% had never heard of hpc before. in terms of hpc knowledge sources, health institutions or medical staff were the most common channel through which people learnt about hpc (63.30%), while new media platforms (e.g., wechat, weibo, tiktok, kuai shou, tou tiao, baidu, etc.) became the preferred channel through which the vast majority of respondents wished to obtain information about hpc (67.90%). furthermore, while 9.70% of respondents acquired hpc knowledge through social or community activities, 40.30% believed these should serve as a key channel for dissemination, highlighting differences in preferred dissemination channels (table s.2). table 1 score of public knowledge on hpc full size table statistically significant variables ( p < 0.05) were first identified through one-way analysis. these variables encompassed: age ( p < 0.001), household income ( p = 0.001), family size ( p = 0.003), single-child family ( p = 0.009), primary family decision-maker ( p = 0.007), educational level ( p < 0.001), employment status ( p = 0.009) and occupation ( p < 0.001) (table s.3). then, these variables were included as independent variables, and the total score of hpc knowledge was used as the dependent variable for multivariate linear regression analysis. as depicted in table 2 , educational level ( β = 0.381) and household income ( β = 0.215) were significantly positively associated with hpc knowledge. the model explained 26.0% of the variance in hpc knowledge (r 2 = 0.26). table 2 results of multiple linear regression analyses of knowledge full size table attitude and associated factors the overall mean score rate for attitude was 84.18%. for subscale a (attitude toward eol care and arrangements for terminally ill patients), the mean score was 23.74 ± 2.84, corresponding to a score rate of 79.13%. the top three highest-scoring items, in descending order, were “a1: death is a normal part of living.” (4.75 ± 0.61), “a4: patient should prepare mentally and spiritually for death.” (4.28 ± 0.86), “a3: patient’s own wishes should determine what treatment he/she should receive.” (4.23 ± 0.90). the lowest scoring item was “a5: if patients are totally dependent on another for daily life, it is best not to prolong their life by any means.” (2.73 ± 1.23). the mean score of subscale b (personal attitude regarding one’s own eol care) was 26.77 ± 3.25, with a score rate of 89.45%. the highest-scoring item was “b3: family or friends accompany.” (4.59 ± 0.70), followed by “b2: get the necessary medical and nursing services in a comfortable treatment environment.” (4.58 ± 0.68). the lowest-scoring item was “b4: don’t be a burden on family.” (4.11 ± 1.02) (table 3 ). table 3 score of public hpc attitude full size table public attitude toward arrangements related to death and related arrangement for terminally ill patients were statistically affected by age, with the 50–59 age group having the highest level. this difference was statistically significant ( p < 0.05) (table s.4). preference and associated factors in lst decisions preference, when asked “if you were in a severe condition in which lst could not recover your health, and you might even have to rely on it over long-term to prolong your life, would you like to accept lst?”, 67.80% chose “no”. in hpc choice preference, if the public were diagnosed with a terminal illness, they most commonly preferred to receive appropriate hpc that focuses on comfort rather than necessarily prolonging life (69.90%). this was followed by prolonging life as much as possible, and receiving appropriate hpc at necessary time or at the end of the treatment (24.50%), and lastly, prolonging life as much as possible even with pain, discomfort and suffering (5.60%). if a family member was diagnosed with a terminal illness, the public’s preference for the three options previously mentioned were in the same order, but the latter two options were significantly higher, at 57.20%, 35.60%, and 7.20%, respectively. when asked about their preference for discussing hpc services if diagnosed with a serious or life-threatening illness, 34.10% chose “close to the end of life”, followed by “at diagnosis of the illness” (24.50%), “during treatment for the illness”(22.60%), and to a lesser extent “once treatment has been stopped” (16.00%) and 2.90% for “never”. in preference for eol care location, home care (47.30%) was the most preferred eol location, including professional home care (25.80%) and family-provided home care (21.50%), followed by hpc/eol facilities (45.00%). fewer respondents selected “general hospital (non-hpc unit)” at 4.00%, “care homes or nursing homes” at 2.60%, and “else” at 1.00%. in terms of preferred eol care services, the vast majority (93.40%) selected symptomatic treatment and comfort care for pain relief as the most desired services. this was followed by psychological counseling and support (63.10%) and family and social support services (63.00%). in contrast, only 15.60% chose religious rituals or belief-related services as a preferred component of eol care. the dependent variable utilized in the analysis was the preference for lst. chi-square test was used to identify significant variables (table s.5), which were then included in the binary logistic regression analysis (table s.5). these variables encompassed: gender ( p = 0.025), age ( p = 0.001), occupation ( p = 0.013), history of chronic diseases ( p = 0.019), experience of caring for the dying patient ( p < 0.001), experience of witnessing a patient’s eol process ( p < 0.001), primary family decision-makers ( p = 0.001), and family size ( p = 0.002). the method of assigning values to the above variables was provided in table 4 . as shown in table 5 , gender, occupation, experience of witnessing a patient’s eol process, primary family decision-makers, family size were significant factors influencing lst preference. females showed a lower preference for lst compared to males ( p = 0.003, or = 0.601), enterprise staff showed lower lst preference compared to public sector employees ( p = 0.004, or = 0.556), and those who had experience witnessing a patient’s eol process showed higher lst preference compared to those with no such experience ( p < 0.001, or = 1.758). in addition, when parents were the primary decision makers in the family, they were less likely to choose lst compared to those who made their own decisions ( p = 0.010, or = 1.537). finally, those with family sizes between 4 and 9 members also showed a lower propensity to receive lst compared to those with family sizes of 1 and 2 members ( p = 0.046, or = 1.587). table 4 variable assignment method full size table table 5 results of logistic regression analysis of lst preference full size table structural equation modeling results the model was validated using the maximum likelihood method, and modification indices (mi) were utilized to adjust and refine the model. from sem, the model had a significant fit with the data, pcmin/df = 2.963 < 3, rmsea = 0.046 (90%ci: 0.038–0.053) < 0.06, gfi = 0.970 > 0.9, agfi = 0.956 > 0.9, nfi = 0.954 > 0.9, ifi = 0.969 > 0.9, cfi = 0.969 > 0.9. the final sem diagram is shown in fig. 1 . fig. 1 kap structural equation modeling diagram full size image the path analysis of sem concluded that knowledge had a positive effect on attitude and preference. from the sem diagram and standardized path coefficients, it can be found that the path coefficient of knowledge on attitude was 0.55 (s.e. = 0.418, p < 0.001). that means that the knowledge is higher, and the attitude will be higher. the path coefficient of attitude on preference was − 0.02 (s.e. = 0.010, p = 0.751). in addition, the path coefficient of knowledge on preference was 0.13 (s.e. = 0.097, p < 0.05). in other words, if the level of knowledge is higher, the preference will be higher. discussion this study used the p-kaphpc scale to assess public kap of hpc. results showed an overall positive attitude yet knowledge remains limited and diverse preference. key influencing factors and correlations among kap were also identified. the study explored the kap situation for hpc from the public perspective in chinese society and provided recommendations for the development of hpc that can be used as a reference for countries with the same cultural background. the results indicated that the general public in china exhibited a high level of awareness of hpc, but with limited ability to explain its concept and some misconceptions. over two-thirds of the general public (67.27%) demonstrated awareness of hpc, exceeding the 47.00% awareness rate among shanghai residents (2021) [ 11 ] and the 50.29% rate among hangzhou community residents (2020) [ 18 ]. this suggests that awareness has improved as national hpc policies have been rolled out in recent years, yet it remains below the levels observed in other developed countries [ 25 ]– [ 26 ]. meanwhile, only 41.10% of the public could explain hpc and there was confusion about the distinction between hospice and euthanasia, aligning with the findings of yin et al. [ 27 ], which showed that the public’s knowledge of hpc still requires improvement. sem results showed that accurate knowledge shapes a positive attitude and directly influences preference choices, highlighting the need for targeted education. this study showed that hpc knowledge level increased significantly with educational level and household income, aligning with international findings [ 16 , 28 , 29 , 30 , 31 , 32 ]. these disparities, explained by the knowledge-gap hypothesis, stem from socioeconomic status (ses) shaping information access. higher education equips individuals with superior information-processing skills and privileged channels to accumulate knowledge. meanwhile, higher-income groups, free from cost constraints and situated in resource-rich environments, are more likely to prioritize psychosocial well-being [ 32 ]. these ses-driven knowledge inequities exacerbate health disparities [ 33 ], potentially trapping low-ses populations in a “cognitive poverty cycle” [ 34 ] due to limited health literacy. therefore, policy should go beyond basic information campaigns. given public’s preference for acquiring hpc knowledge through community activities, prioritizing community-based education becomes essential. its accessible, contextualized communication can effectively reduce disparities. this aligns with the 2023 world hpc day theme, “compassionate communities together for palliative care”, emphasizes community advocacy in overcoming cultural barriers to hpc. additionally, medical professionals, as the primary source of hpc knowledge for the public, should take on greater responsibility for education and awareness. therefore, it is essential to provide training to enhance their expertise and communication skills, enabling them to convey clear hpc knowledge based on the public’s trust in them. since 2016, the u.s. centers for medicare and medicaid services have recognized acp discussions as a distinct reimbursable service. physicians can receive payment if they provide at least 30 min of face-to-face communication with patients or their families and complete the required documentation, which has effectively encouraged healthcare professionals to initiate hpc conversations [ 35 ]. in recent years, china has also begun to introduce supportive policies and practices. hpc has been formally added to the national health system as a new healthcare service item, with acp explicitly listed among its thirteen core elements [ 36 ]. at the provincial level, almost all pilot areas have established hpc training bases that provide regular, systematic training for healthcare professionals, while also enhancing public awareness through initiatives such as hpc awareness weeks and free consultation events. these measures not only offer policy and practical support for providers to engage in hpc education, but also lay the groundwork for the broader societal integration of hpc principles. the study revealed that the public generally holds a favorable attitude toward the principles and content of hpc (84.18%), but significant cultural and ethical conflicts arise in practice. while respondents widely accepted the idea that death is a normal part of life, they were less inclined to agree with the notion that “if patients are completely dependent on others for daily life, it is best not to prolong their lives by any means”. this disparity underscores the tension between filial traditions and quality-of-life perspectives, as family obligations to prolong life at all costs often take precedence over individual autonomy. additionally, respondents were more likely to choose comfort-oriented hpc for themselves (69.90%) than for their family members (57.00%), reflecting the strong influence of family ethics and the cultural importance of filial responsibility in decision-making. despite supporting the principle of honoring patients’ preferences, respondents showed weaker support for direct communication with physicians, suggesting that informed consent remains aspirational rather than implemented in practice. sem results confirmed that a positive attitude did not significantly translate into actual preferences. in china’s family-oriented culture, although the public agrees with the hpc concept, family ethics, filial piety, and social responsibility often prevent attitudes from turning into behavior, posing a challenge to hpc promotion. this phenomenon can be attributed to two aspects. firstly, under the influence of traditional family concepts, medical decision-making is often dominated by the family decision-maker, and patients may form the inertia of “family members do it for them”. secondly, most patients leave medical decision-making to the family decision-maker, or put their family’s needs above their own wishes [ 37 ]. to effectively implement hpc, policymakers must first enact legal safeguards for acp and ad to protect patient autonomy, establishing them as primary medical orders superseding familial conflicts. second, adapting the stepwise communication protocol from the u.s. spirit intervention [ 38 ] can develop culturally congruent decision-making tools that foster intra-family consensus. empirical evidence showed that the principles of hpc can coexist with filial piety [ 39 ]. when a dignified death is seen as an act of modern filial piety instead of a betrayal of it, traditional ethics and modern hpc can finally align. the results showed that individuals who had witnessed the death of terminally ill patients were more likely to decline lst, consistent with jing et al. [ 24 ]. this is likely because death-related experiences prompt reflections on the meaning of life. observing the pain and suffering of patients may shift their focus toward preserving dignity and improving quality of life, fostering a more positive preference for hpc [ 40 ]. this phenomenon provides valuable insights into death education practices, which can be promoted by creating safe and supportive environments, such as moderately open ward visits and encouraging the sharing of caregiving experiences. these initiatives can facilitate observation, reflection, and dialogue about the dying process. families with more than 3 persons had a significantly lower preference for lst compared to families with 1–2 persons. this outcome challenges the prevailing view that greater family support inevitably leads to more aggressive care [ 41 ], suggesting that larger families may foster their own distinct decision style and support network. such families typically have access to a wider pool of informal caregivers, reducing the perceived need for prolonged, technology-driven interventions, and making comfort-oriented hpc a more realistic first choice. the broader network of relationships also introduces multiple perspectives, shared deliberation, and diffused responsibility, which eases the emotional burden on any single decision-maker and steers choices toward the patient’s overall well-being [ 42 ]. in contrast, small nuclear families often face limited resources and heightened isolation when making eol decisions [ 43 ]– [ 44 ], factors that can increase their reliance on medical technology. this study also revealed a growing public preference for home-based hpc, with desired services including symptom management, psychological support, and family and social support. these preferences underscore the need for a hybrid “home-based and community” care model that integrates family networks with professional services [ 45 ]. this balanced approach, which avoids over-reliance on family caregiving while maintaining family ties, aligns with china’s social context. however, the implementation of this service still faces practical barriers. first, the limited availability of full-time hpc professionals at the primary level limits service accessibility. second, home-based services are not yet fully covered by medical insurance, which results in high out-of-pocket costs for patients. third, insufficient public awareness of hpc continues to impede its uptake [ 46 ]. in response, national policies have begun to address these challenges by gradually incorporating home-based hpc into the health insurance reimbursement system and emphasizing the establishment of a service network that links community, home-based, and institutional care [ 47 ]– [ 48 ]. building on these initiatives, we recommend increasing financial investment in home-based hpc, strengthening community resource integration, expanding the grassroots medical teams, and conducting systematic public education initiatives. enterprise employees demonstrated a lower preference for lst than public-sector employees. the latter, typically employed within the civil service or other publicly funded institutions, benefit from stable employment and comprehensive welfare coverage [ 49 ]. such conditions appear to cultivate a taken-for-granted trust in the conventional medical paradigm. conversely, a corporate culture prioritizing competition and efficiency heightens enterprise employees cost and risk sensitivity. combined with employment instability, which erodes future security, this dual pressure makes employees confronting chronically diminished quality of life more likely to adopt a pragmatic loss-minimization mindset. this subsequently inclines them to refuse lst. these findings suggest that occupationally shaped daily experiences may ultimately be transformed into an important basis for individuals’ eol choices. limitation there were several limitations in our study. first, this is a cross-sectional study, showing only correlations but no causal relationship between kap and influencing factors. second, the kap of the public for hpc may change over time, but cross-sectional studies are unable to capture such dynamic changes. third, there may be some bias in the representativeness of the sample. considering the sensitivity of the topic and ethical issues, an online survey was designed in this study, and the form of voluntary participation may have brought about bias in the sample, while the respondents attracted in this way may themselves have a higher degree of identification with the hpc topic, leading to biased results. however, at a time when hpc in china is still in its infancy, systematic evaluations from a public perspective are extremely scarce; the sensitivity of the topic and the difficulty of judging it further exacerbate the research gap. despite the biased sample in this study, the results provide preliminary data and hypotheses for subsequent research in this area. future studies can enhance the representativeness and causal inference of the sample through a mixed sampling strategy combining multi-temporal longitudinal tracking, online and offline, as well as an anonymous randomized design, in order to obtain more robust and comprehensive conclusions. conclusion this study revealed the current status and challenges of public kap of hpc. although the public generally has a positive attitude toward hpc, the quality of the public knowledge of hpc needs to be improved and preference varies. education level and household income were associated with knowledge, while attitude was influenced by education level and age. several factors were found to affect public preference, with knowledge playing a positive role in shaping both attitude and preference. traditional cultural concepts and ethics to some extent bring conflict in hpc decision making. therefore, it is recommended to enhance hpc education, reinforce legal protection of acp and ad, introduce culturally appropriate communication tools for family consensus, and establish a home-community mixed care model. these measures are expected to foster greater public participation in hpc. data availability data is available from the corresponding author on reasonable request. abbreviations hpc: hospice and palliative

among all the respondents, the mean score for hpc knowledge was 7.47 ± 2.14, with 41.10% of the respondents could explain hpc. educational level and household income were associated factors of knowledge ( p < 0.05). the overall attitude mean score rate was 84.18%. public attitude toward end-of-life (eol) arrangements for terminally ill patients was significantly influenced by age, attitude toward one’s own eol care were affected by educational level ( p < 0.05). the majority (67.80%) declined life-sustaining treatment (lst), with preference linked to gender, occupation, experience of witnessing a patient’s eol process, primary family decision-makers, and family size ( p < 0.05). most respondents (47.30%) preferred home as the place for the eol care. structural equation modeling analysis showed that knowledge was positively associated with attitude ( β = 4.97, p < 0.001) and knowledge was positively associated with preference ( β = 0.22, p < 0.001). conclusions the public attitude toward hpc is generally positive, though there is a need to improve the quality of public knowledge, and preference varies. knowledge has a positive influence on both attitude and preference. traditional cultural values and ethics sometimes create conflicts in hpc decision-making. therefore, it is recommended to strengthen hpc education, enhance legal protections for advance care planning (acp) and advance directives (ad), introduce culturally appropriate family consensus communication tools, and establish a home-community hybrid care model. peer review reports introduction with global population aging and the rising burden of chronic non-communicable diseases, there is growing recognition of the need for a more compassionate and patient-centered approach to end-of-life (eol) care [ 1 ]. hospice and palliative care (hpc) has been widely acknowledged as a pivotal intervention to enhance the quality of life for terminally ill patients and their families. in china, despite the implementation of three rounds of hpc pilot programs since 2017, the actual utilization remains remarkably low, with bed occupancy rates in some areas falling below 20% [ 2 ]. within china’s unique sociocultural context, several deeply rooted beliefs—such as the association of filial piety with life-prolonging interventions, the cultural taboo surrounding death-related discussions, and the prevailing view that “better a bad life than a good death”—hinder meaningful engagement with hpc. these factors constrain the effectiveness of hpc, even where services are adequately available. consequently, understanding the public’s knowledge, attitude, and preference (kap) regarding hpc becomes critically important to identify culturally specific barriers and inform context-sensitive strategies to promote service uptake. international studies have consistently highlighted the importance of public kap toward hpc in its successful adoption [ 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 ]. however, research in china has primarily focused on the kap of medical professionals and terminally ill patients, or is limited to specific regions and groups such as the elderly, community residents, and chronic disease patients, which restricts capturing the diverse perspectives of the general public [ 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 ]. furthermore, several studies have concentrated on sub-topics such as advance care planning (acp) and advance directives (ad), yet these have not been integrated into the broader framework of hpc services. as a result, this has led to a fragmented understanding of the public’s genuine needs and the barriers they face [ 12 , 13 , 14 ]. moreover, survey instruments, which were adapted from those designed for medical professionals, have not undergone adequate cultural adjustments. this hampers their ability to accurately capture the unique perspectives of the general public within their specific cultural context. finally, existing research fails to provide a comprehensive exploration of the interrelationships among the three components of kap, along with the pathways through which they influence each other [ 15 , 16 , 17 , 18 ]. to bridge the gap, this study focuses on the public perspective, providing a comprehensive assessment of the kap of the general public across china using a culturally adapted and locally validated kap scale. by exploring key influencing factors and potential barriers, this study aims to foster greater public engagement with hpc and improve the quality of eol care in china. ultimately, it seeks to generate evidence-based insight to inform targeted interventions for hpc development, contributing to its broader integration into the healthcare system and societal discourse. methods statistical methods statistical analyses were performed using ibm spss statistics 27.0 (ibm corporation, armonk, ny). descriptive statistics were used to analyze the respondents’ demographic, health status information and kap scores. continuous variables were described by mean ± standard deviation (sd), while categorical variables were presented as frequency and percentages. one-way analyses and regression analyses were used to explore the factors that influence kap. structural equation modeling (sem) was constructed to explore the causal relationship between observed and latent variables, with kap as latent variables and their secondary dimensions as observed variables in the hypothetical model. fit indices such as pearson chi-square minimum discrepancy divided by degrees of freedom (pcmin/df), root mean square error of approximation (rmsea), goodness of fit index (gfi), adjusted goodness of fit index (agfi), normative fit index (nfi), incremental fit index (ifi), and comparative fit index (cfi) were used to determine if the model was well fitted. a two-tailed significance level of α = 0.05 was used. questionnaires this study was designed as a cross-sectional survey using an anonymous questionnaire. respondents were informed of the voluntary nature of their involvement and provided informed consent. to ensure cultural and contextual relevance, we developed the public knowledge, attitude, and preference of hpc scale (p-kaphpcs), specifically for this study (supplementary file 1). the scale was created through a systematic review of international kap studies on hpc [ 19 , 20 , 21 , 22 , 23 , 24 ], followed by a rigorous adaptation and localization process to align with china’s sociocultural landscape and the realities of hpc development. this culturally tailored instrument strengthened the validity and relevance of our findings, ensuring that the measured constructs accurately reflect public perceptions within the chinese context. the scale comprised four sections: (1) 25 demographic and health status items; (2) 12 knowledge items. three items were designed to assess the public’s self-perceived knowledge and access to hpc, with only option percentages calculated. nine items tested the public’s understanding of hpc, yielding a total score ranging from 0 to 9 (1 point for correct ‘true’ responses; ‘false’ or ‘don’t know’ scored 0); (3) 12 attitude items about hpc service content and philosophy (subscale a: attitude toward eol care and arrangements for terminally ill patients. subscale b: personal attitude regarding one’s own eol care). the attitude scale used a 5-point likert scale, with items in subscale a scored from “strongly disagree” 1 to “strongly agree” 5, with items a2 and a6 reverse-scored and adjusted during analysis. items in subscale b were scored from “very unimportant” 1 to “very important” 5; (4) six preference items addressed life-sustaining treatment (lst) decisions, hpc choice, eol care services and location. as these items were not designed to produce a composite score, no total score was calculated. it has demonstrated good reliability and validity, cronbach’s α coefficients for the knowledge scale and attitude scale were 0.881 and 0.818, respectively. the preference scale showed high relevance and significance, with a score of 5, and the coefficient of variation was less than 0.001. data collection to systematically assess the chinese public’s kap for hpc in china, we conducted a nationwide, anonymous, cross-sectional online survey between december 2023 and april 2024. questionnaires were distributed and collected through surveystar (changsha ranxing science and technology, shanghai, china), a widely used chinese platform, yielding 947 valid responses (effective response rate = 98.85%). after age verification, three respondents were found to be under 18 years old; in strict accordance with the study protocol and ethical approval, these three cases were excluded, leaving 944 participants for analysis. the sample covered 26 provinces across eastern, central, and western china, ensuring broad regional representation. to minimize potential bias, all quality-control personnel received centralized training, and a dual, back-to-back quality-control review was implemented throughout the data-collection process. results general demographic and health status information the survey participants were members of the chinese general public, with 734 (77.80%) identifying as female. ages ranged from 18 to 84 years, with a mean of 41.07 ± 15.06 years. the largest income group (48.30%) reported an annual household income of 100,000 to 300,000 yuan. in terms of marital status, 641 (67.90%) were married, and the majority (52.50%) had an undergraduate education (496 participants) (table s.1). knowledge and associated factors the survey indicated that respondents had a good level of knowledge regarding the concept of hpc, with a mean score of 7.47 ± 2.14 and an overall accuracy rate of 83.01%. most items scored above 80.00% (table 1 ), but there were significant gaps in respondents’ understanding of “providing home care (on-site) for eol patients is not part of hpc” (k4, 65.40%) and “hpc encourages people to stop treatment for their incurable illness” (k2, 76.50%). the results showed that 41.10% of the respondents could explain hpc, while 26.20% were aware of it but could not clearly articulate its meaning. additionally, 22.70% had only heard of the concept, and 10.04% had never heard of hpc before. in terms of hpc knowledge sources, health institutions or medical staff were the most common channel through which people learnt about hpc (63.30%), while new media platforms (e.g., wechat, weibo, tiktok, kuai shou, tou tiao, baidu, etc.) became the preferred channel through which the vast majority of respondents wished to obtain information about hpc (67.90%). furthermore, while 9.70% of respondents acquired hpc knowledge through social or community activities, 40.30% believed these should serve as a key channel for dissemination, highlighting differences in preferred dissemination channels (table s.2). table 1 score of public knowledge on hpc full size table statistically significant variables ( p < 0.05) were first identified through one-way analysis. these variables encompassed: age ( p < 0.001), household income ( p = 0.001), family size ( p = 0.003), single-child family ( p = 0.009), primary family decision-maker ( p = 0.007), educational level ( p < 0.001), employment status ( p = 0.009) and occupation ( p < 0.001) (table s.3). then, these variables were included as independent variables, and the total score of hpc knowledge was used as the dependent variable for multivariate linear regression analysis. as depicted in table 2 , educational level ( β = 0.381) and household income ( β = 0.215) were significantly positively associated with hpc knowledge. the model explained 26.0% of the variance in hpc knowledge (r 2 = 0.26). table 2 results of multiple linear regression analyses of knowledge full size table attitude and associated factors the overall mean score rate for attitude was 84.18%. for subscale a (attitude toward eol care and arrangements for terminally ill patients), the mean score was 23.74 ± 2.84, corresponding to a score rate of 79.13%. the top three highest-scoring items, in descending order, were “a1: death is a normal part of living.” (4.75 ± 0.61), “a4: patient should prepare mentally and spiritually for death.” (4.28 ± 0.86), “a3: patient’s own wishes should determine what treatment he/she should receive.” (4.23 ± 0.90). the lowest scoring item was “a5: if patients are totally dependent on another for daily life, it is best not to prolong their life by any means.” (2.73 ± 1.23). the mean score of subscale b (personal attitude regarding one’s own eol care) was 26.77 ± 3.25, with a score rate of 89.45%. the highest-scoring item was “b3: family or friends accompany.” (4.59 ± 0.70), followed by “b2: get the necessary medical and nursing services in a comfortable treatment environment.” (4.58 ± 0.68). the lowest-scoring item was “b4: don’t be a burden on family.” (4.11 ± 1.02) (table 3 ). table 3 score of public hpc attitude full size table public attitude toward arrangements related to death and related arrangement for terminally ill patients were statistically affected by age, with the 50–59 age group having the highest level. this difference was statistically significant ( p < 0.05) (table s.4). preference and associated factors in lst decisions preference, when asked “if you were in a severe condition in which lst could not recover your health, and you might even have to rely on it over long-term to prolong your life, would you like to accept lst?”, 67.80% chose “no”. in hpc choice preference, if the public were diagnosed with a terminal illness, they most commonly preferred to receive appropriate hpc that focuses on comfort rather than necessarily prolonging life (69.90%). this was followed by prolonging life as much as possible, and receiving appropriate hpc at necessary time or at the end of the treatment (24.50%), and lastly, prolonging life as much as possible even with pain, discomfort and suffering (5.60%). if a family member was diagnosed with a terminal illness, the public’s preference for the three options previously mentioned were in the same order, but the latter two options were significantly higher, at 57.20%, 35.60%, and 7.20%, respectively. when asked about their preference for discussing hpc services if diagnosed with a serious or life-threatening illness, 34.10% chose “close to the end of life”, followed by “at diagnosis of the illness” (24.50%), “during treatment for the illness”(22.60%), and to a lesser extent “once treatment has been stopped” (16.00%) and 2.90% for “never”. in preference for eol care location, home care (47.30%) was the most preferred eol location, including professional home care (25.80%) and family-provided home care (21.50%), followed by hpc/eol facilities (45.00%). fewer respondents selected “general hospital (non-hpc unit)” at 4.00%, “care homes or nursing homes” at 2.60%, and “else” at 1.00%. in terms of preferred eol care services, the vast majority (93.40%) selected symptomatic treatment and comfort care for pain relief as the most desired services. this was followed by psychological counseling and support (63.10%) and family and social support services (63.00%). in contrast, only 15.60% chose religious rituals or belief-related services as a preferred component of eol care. the dependent variable utilized in the analysis was the preference for lst. chi-square test was used to identify significant variables (table s.5), which were then included in the binary logistic regression analysis (table s.5). these variables encompassed: gender ( p = 0.025), age ( p = 0.001), occupation ( p = 0.013), history of chronic diseases ( p = 0.019), experience of caring for the dying patient ( p < 0.001), experience of witnessing a patient’s eol process ( p < 0.001), primary family decision-makers ( p = 0.001), and family size ( p = 0.002). the method of assigning values to the above variables was provided in table 4 . as shown in table 5 , gender, occupation, experience of witnessing a patient’s eol process, primary family decision-makers, family size were significant factors influencing lst preference. females showed a lower preference for lst compared to males ( p = 0.003, or = 0.601), enterprise staff showed lower lst preference compared to public sector employees ( p = 0.004, or = 0.556), and those who had experience witnessing a patient’s eol process showed higher lst preference compared to those with no such experience ( p < 0.001, or = 1.758). in addition, when parents were the primary decision makers in the family, they were less likely to choose lst compared to those who made their own decisions ( p = 0.010, or = 1.537). finally, those with family sizes between 4 and 9 members also showed a lower propensity to receive lst compared to those with family sizes of 1 and 2 members ( p = 0.046, or = 1.587). table 4 variable assignment method full size table table 5 results of logistic regression analysis of lst preference full size table structural equation modeling results the model was validated using the maximum likelihood method, and modification indices (mi) were utilized to adjust and refine the model. from sem, the model had a significant fit with the data, pcmin/df = 2.963 < 3, rmsea = 0.046 (90%ci: 0.038–0.053) < 0.06, gfi = 0.970 > 0.9, agfi = 0.956 > 0.9, nfi = 0.954 > 0.9, ifi = 0.969 > 0.9, cfi = 0.969 > 0.9. the final sem diagram is shown in fig. 1 . fig. 1 kap structural equation modeling diagram full size image the path analysis of sem concluded that knowledge had a positive effect on attitude and preference. from the sem diagram and standardized path coefficients, it can be found that the path coefficient of knowledge on attitude was 0.55 (s.e. = 0.418, p < 0.001). that means that the knowledge is higher, and the attitude will be higher. the path coefficient of attitude on preference was − 0.02 (s.e. = 0.010, p = 0.751). in addition, the path coefficient of knowledge on preference was 0.13 (s.e. = 0.097, p < 0.05). in other words, if the level of knowledge is higher, the preference will be higher. discussion this study used the p-kaphpc scale to assess public kap of hpc. results showed an overall positive attitude yet knowledge remains limited and diverse preference. key influencing factors and correlations among kap were also identified. the study explored the kap situation for hpc from the public perspective in chinese society and provided recommendations for the development of hpc that can be used as a reference for countries with the same cultural background. the results indicated that the general public in china exhibited a high level of awareness of hpc, but with limited ability to explain its concept and some misconceptions. over two-thirds of the general public (67.27%) demonstrated awareness of hpc, exceeding the 47.00% awareness rate among shanghai residents (2021) [ 11 ] and the 50.29% rate among hangzhou community residents (2020) [ 18 ]. this suggests that awareness has improved as national hpc policies have been rolled out in recent years, yet it remains below the levels observed in other developed countries [ 25 ]– [ 26 ]. meanwhile, only 41.10% of the public could explain hpc and there was confusion about the distinction between hospice and euthanasia, aligning with the findings of yin et al. [ 27 ], which showed that the public’s knowledge of hpc still requires improvement. sem results showed that accurate knowledge shapes a positive attitude and directly influences preference choices, highlighting the need for targeted education. this study showed that hpc knowledge level increased significantly with educational level and household income, aligning with international findings [ 16 , 28 , 29 , 30 , 31 , 32 ]. these disparities, explained by the knowledge-gap hypothesis, stem from socioeconomic status (ses) shaping information access. higher education equips individuals with superior information-processing skills and privileged channels to accumulate knowledge. meanwhile, higher-income groups, free from cost constraints and situated in resource-rich environments, are more likely to prioritize psychosocial well-being [ 32 ]. these ses-driven knowledge inequities exacerbate health disparities [ 33 ], potentially trapping low-ses populations in a “cognitive poverty cycle” [ 34 ] due to limited health literacy. therefore, policy should go beyond basic information campaigns. given public’s preference for acquiring hpc knowledge through community activities, prioritizing community-based education becomes essential. its accessible, contextualized communication can effectively reduce disparities. this aligns with the 2023 world hpc day theme, “compassionate communities together for palliative care”, emphasizes community advocacy in overcoming cultural barriers to hpc. additionally, medical professionals, as the primary source of hpc knowledge for the public, should take on greater responsibility for education and awareness. therefore, it is essential to provide training to enhance their expertise and communication skills, enabling them to convey clear hpc knowledge based on the public’s trust in them. since 2016, the u.s. centers for medicare and medicaid services have recognized acp discussions as a distinct reimbursable service. physicians can receive payment if they provide at least 30 min of face-to-face communication with patients or their families and complete the required documentation, which has effectively encouraged healthcare professionals to initiate hpc conversations [ 35 ]. in recent years, china has also begun to introduce supportive policies and practices. hpc has been formally added to the national health system as a new healthcare service item, with acp explicitly listed among its thirteen core elements [ 36 ]. at the provincial level, almost all pilot areas have established hpc training bases that provide regular, systematic training for healthcare professionals, while also enhancing public awareness through initiatives such as hpc awareness weeks and free consultation events. these measures not only offer policy and practical support for providers to engage in hpc education, but also lay the groundwork for the broader societal integration of hpc principles. the study revealed that the public generally holds a favorable attitude toward the principles and content of hpc (84.18%), but significant cultural and ethical conflicts arise in practice. while respondents widely accepted the idea that death is a normal part of life, they were less inclined to agree with the notion that “if patients are completely dependent on others for daily life, it is best not to prolong their lives by any means”. this disparity underscores the tension between filial traditions and quality-of-life perspectives, as family obligations to prolong life at all costs often take precedence over individual autonomy. additionally, respondents were more likely to choose comfort-oriented hpc for themselves (69.90%) than for their family members (57.00%), reflecting the strong influence of family ethics and the cultural importance of filial responsibility in decision-making. despite supporting the principle of honoring patients’ preferences, respondents showed weaker support for direct communication with physicians, suggesting that informed consent remains aspirational rather than implemented in practice. sem results confirmed that a positive attitude did not significantly translate into actual preferences. in china’s family-oriented culture, although the public agrees with the hpc concept, family ethics, filial piety, and social responsibility often prevent attitudes from turning into behavior, posing a challenge to hpc promotion. this phenomenon can be attributed to two aspects. firstly, under the influence of traditional family concepts, medical decision-making is often dominated by the family decision-maker, and patients may form the inertia of “family members do it for them”. secondly, most patients leave medical decision-making to the family decision-maker, or put their family’s needs above their own wishes [ 37 ]. to effectively implement hpc, policymakers must first enact legal safeguards for acp and ad to protect patient autonomy, establishing them as primary medical orders superseding familial conflicts. second, adapting the stepwise communication protocol from the u.s. spirit intervention [ 38 ] can develop culturally congruent decision-making tools that foster intra-family consensus. empirical evidence showed that the principles of hpc can coexist with filial piety [ 39 ]. when a dignified death is seen as an act of modern filial piety instead of a betrayal of it, traditional ethics and modern hpc can finally align. the results showed that individuals who had witnessed the death of terminally ill patients were more likely to decline lst, consistent with jing et al. [ 24 ]. this is likely because death-related experiences prompt reflections on the meaning of life. observing the pain and suffering of patients may shift their focus toward preserving dignity and improving quality of life, fostering a more positive preference for hpc [ 40 ]. this phenomenon provides valuable insights into death education practices, which can be promoted by creating safe and supportive environments, such as moderately open ward visits and encouraging the sharing of caregiving experiences. these initiatives can facilitate observation, reflection, and dialogue about the dying process. families with more than 3 persons had a significantly lower preference for lst compared to families with 1–2 persons. this outcome challenges the prevailing view that greater family support inevitably leads to more aggressive care [ 41 ], suggesting that larger families may foster their own distinct decision style and support network. such families typically have access to a wider pool of informal caregivers, reducing the perceived need for prolonged, technology-driven interventions, and making comfort-oriented hpc a more realistic first choice. the broader network of relationships also introduces multiple perspectives, shared deliberation, and diffused responsibility, which eases the emotional burden on any single decision-maker and steers choices toward the patient’s overall well-being [ 42 ]. in contrast, small nuclear families often face limited resources and heightened isolation when making eol decisions [ 43 ]– [ 44 ], factors that can increase their reliance on medical technology. this study also revealed a growing public preference for home-based hpc, with desired services including symptom management, psychological support, and family and social support. these preferences underscore the need for a hybrid “home-based and community” care model that integrates family networks with professional services [ 45 ]. this balanced approach, which avoids over-reliance on family caregiving while maintaining family ties, aligns with china’s social context. however, the implementation of this service still faces practical barriers. first, the limited availability of full-time hpc professionals at the primary level limits service accessibility. second, home-based services are not yet fully covered by medical insurance, which results in high out-of-pocket costs for patients. third, insufficient public awareness of hpc continues to impede its uptake [ 46 ]. in response, national policies have begun to address these challenges by gradually incorporating home-based hpc into the health insurance reimbursement system and emphasizing the establishment of a service network that links community, home-based, and institutional care [ 47 ]– [ 48 ]. building on these initiatives, we recommend increasing financial investment in home-based hpc, strengthening community resource integration, expanding the grassroots medical teams, and conducting systematic public education initiatives. enterprise employees demonstrated a lower preference for lst than public-sector employees. the latter, typically employed within the civil service or other publicly funded institutions, benefit from stable employment and comprehensive welfare coverage [ 49 ]. such conditions appear to cultivate a taken-for-granted trust in the conventional medical paradigm. conversely, a corporate culture prioritizing competition and efficiency heightens enterprise employees cost and risk sensitivity. combined with employment instability, which erodes future security, this dual pressure makes employees confronting chronically diminished quality of life more likely to adopt a pragmatic loss-minimization mindset. this subsequently inclines them to refuse lst. these findings suggest that occupationally shaped daily experiences may ultimately be transformed into an important basis for individuals’ eol choices. limitation there were several limitations in our study. first, this is a cross-sectional study, showing only correlations but no causal relationship between kap and influencing factors. second, the kap of the public for hpc may change over time, but cross-sectional studies are unable to capture such dynamic changes. third, there may be some bias in the representativeness of the sample. considering the sensitivity of the topic and ethical issues, an online survey was designed in this study, and the form of voluntary participation may have brought about bias in the sample, while the respondents attracted in this way may themselves have a higher degree of identification with the hpc topic, leading to biased results. however, at a time when hpc in china is still in its infancy, systematic evaluations from a public perspective are extremely scarce; the sensitivity of the topic and the difficulty of judging it further exacerbate the research gap. despite the biased sample in this study, the results provide preliminary data and hypotheses for subsequent research in this area. future studies can enhance the representativeness and causal inference of the sample through a mixed sampling strategy combining multi-temporal longitudinal tracking, online and offline, as well as an anonymous randomized design, in order to obtain more robust and comprehensive conclusions. conclusion this study revealed the current status and challenges of public kap of hpc. although the public generally has a positive attitude toward hpc, the quality of the public knowledge of hpc needs to be improved and preference varies. education level and household income were associated with knowledge, while attitude was influenced by education level and age. several factors were found to affect public preference, with knowledge playing a positive role in shaping both attitude and preference. traditional cultural concepts and ethics to some extent bring conflict in hpc decision making. therefore, it is recommended to enhance hpc education, reinforce legal protection of acp and ad, introduce culturally appropriate communication tools for family consensus, and establish a home-community mixed care model. these measures are expected to foster greater public participation in hpc. data availability data is available from the corresponding author on reasonable request. abbreviations hpc: hospice and palliative

this study used the p-kaphpc scale to assess public kap of hpc. results showed an overall positive attitude yet knowledge remains limited and diverse preference. key influencing factors and correlations among kap were also identified. the study explored the kap situation for hpc from the public perspective in chinese society and provided recommendations for the development of hpc that can be used as a reference for countries with the same cultural background. the results indicated that the general public in china exhibited a high level of awareness of hpc, but with limited ability to explain its concept and some misconceptions. over two-thirds of the general public (67.27%) demonstrated awareness of hpc, exceeding the 47.00% awareness rate among shanghai residents (2021) [ 11 ] and the 50.29% rate among hangzhou community residents (2020) [ 18 ]. this suggests that awareness has improved as national hpc policies have been rolled out in recent years, yet it remains below the levels observed in other developed countries [ 25 ]– [ 26 ]. meanwhile, only 41.10% of the public could explain hpc and there was confusion about the distinction between hospice and euthanasia, aligning with the findings of yin et al. [ 27 ], which showed that the public’s knowledge of hpc still requires improvement. sem results showed that accurate knowledge shapes a positive attitude and directly influences preference choices, highlighting the need for targeted education. this study showed that hpc knowledge level increased significantly with educational level and household income, aligning with international findings [ 16 , 28 , 29 , 30 , 31 , 32 ]. these disparities, explained by the knowledge-gap hypothesis, stem from socioeconomic status (ses) shaping information access. higher education equips individuals with superior information-processing skills and privileged channels to accumulate knowledge. meanwhile, higher-income groups, free from cost constraints and situated in resource-rich environments, are more likely to prioritize psychosocial well-being [ 32 ]. these ses-driven knowledge inequities exacerbate health disparities [ 33 ], potentially trapping low-ses populations in a “cognitive poverty cycle” [ 34 ] due to limited health literacy. therefore, policy should go beyond basic information campaigns. given public’s preference for acquiring hpc knowledge through community activities, prioritizing community-based education becomes essential. its accessible, contextualized communication can effectively reduce disparities. this aligns with the 2023 world hpc day theme, “compassionate communities together for palliative care”, emphasizes community advocacy in overcoming cultural barriers to hpc. additionally, medical professionals, as the primary source of hpc knowledge for the public, should take on greater responsibility for education and awareness. therefore, it is essential to provide training to enhance their expertise and communication skills, enabling them to convey clear hpc knowledge based on the public’s trust in them. since 2016, the u.s. centers for medicare and medicaid services have recognized acp discussions as a distinct reimbursable service. physicians can receive payment if they provide at least 30 min of face-to-face communication with patients or their families and complete the required documentation, which has effectively encouraged healthcare professionals to initiate hpc conversations [ 35 ]. in recent years, china has also begun to introduce supportive policies and practices. hpc has been formally added to the national health system as a new healthcare service item, with acp explicitly listed among its thirteen core elements [ 36 ]. at the provincial level, almost all pilot areas have established hpc training bases that provide regular, systematic training for healthcare professionals, while also enhancing public awareness through initiatives such as hpc awareness weeks and free consultation events. these measures not only offer policy and practical support for providers to engage in hpc education, but also lay the groundwork for the broader societal integration of hpc principles. the study revealed that the public generally holds a favorable attitude toward the principles and content of hpc (84.18%), but significant cultural and ethical conflicts arise in practice. while respondents widely accepted the idea that death is a normal part of life, they were less inclined to agree with the notion that “if patients are completely dependent on others for daily life, it is best not to prolong their lives by any means”. this disparity underscores the tension between filial traditions and quality-of-life perspectives, as family obligations to prolong life at all costs often take precedence over individual autonomy. additionally, respondents were more likely to choose comfort-oriented hpc for themselves (69.90%) than for their family members (57.00%), reflecting the strong influence of family ethics and the cultural importance of filial responsibility in decision-making. despite supporting the principle of honoring patients’ preferences, respondents showed weaker support for direct communication with physicians, suggesting that informed consent remains aspirational rather than implemented in practice. sem results confirmed that a positive attitude did not significantly translate into actual preferences. in china’s family-oriented culture, although the public agrees with the hpc concept, family ethics, filial piety, and social responsibility often prevent attitudes from turning into behavior, posing a challenge to hpc promotion. this phenomenon can be attributed to two aspects. firstly, under the influence of traditional family concepts, medical decision-making is often dominated by the family decision-maker, and patients may form the inertia of “family members do it for them”. secondly, most patients leave medical decision-making to the family decision-maker, or put their family’s needs above their own wishes [ 37 ]. to effectively implement hpc, policymakers must first enact legal safeguards for acp and ad to protect patient autonomy, establishing them as primary medical orders superseding familial conflicts. second, adapting the stepwise communication protocol from the u.s. spirit intervention [ 38 ] can develop culturally congruent decision-making tools that foster intra-family consensus. empirical evidence showed that the principles of hpc can coexist with filial piety [ 39 ]. when a dignified death is seen as an act of modern filial piety instead of a betrayal of it, traditional ethics and modern hpc can finally align. the results showed that individuals who had witnessed the death of terminally ill patients were more likely to decline lst, consistent with jing et al. [ 24 ]. this is likely because death-related experiences prompt reflections on the meaning of life. observing the pain and suffering of patients may shift their focus toward preserving dignity and improving quality of life, fostering a more positive preference for hpc [ 40 ]. this phenomenon provides valuable insights into death education practices, which can be promoted by creating safe and supportive environments, such as moderately open ward visits and encouraging the sharing of caregiving experiences. these initiatives can facilitate observation, reflection, and dialogue about the dying process. families with more than 3 persons had a significantly lower preference for lst compared to families with 1–2 persons. this outcome challenges the prevailing view that greater family support inevitably leads to more aggressive care [ 41 ], suggesting that larger families may foster their own distinct decision style and support network. such families typically have access to a wider pool of informal caregivers, reducing the perceived need for prolonged, technology-driven interventions, and making comfort-oriented hpc a more realistic first choice. the broader network of relationships also introduces multiple perspectives, shared deliberation, and diffused responsibility, which eases the emotional burden on any single decision-maker and steers choices toward the patient’s overall well-being [ 42 ]. in contrast, small nuclear families often face limited resources and heightened isolation when making eol decisions [ 43 ]– [ 44 ], factors that can increase their reliance on medical technology. this study also revealed a growing public preference for home-based hpc, with desired services including symptom management, psychological support, and family and social support. these preferences underscore the need for a hybrid “home-based and community” care model that integrates family networks with professional services [ 45 ]. this balanced approach, which avoids over-reliance on family caregiving while maintaining family ties, aligns with china’s social context. however, the implementation of this service still faces practical barriers. first, the limited availability of full-time hpc professionals at the primary level limits service accessibility. second, home-based services are not yet fully covered by medical insurance, which results in high out-of-pocket costs for patients. third, insufficient public awareness of hpc continues to impede its uptake [ 46 ]. in response, national policies have begun to address these challenges by gradually incorporating home-based hpc into the health insurance reimbursement system and emphasizing the establishment of a service network that links community, home-based, and institutional care [ 47 ]– [ 48 ]. building on these initiatives, we recommend increasing financial investment in home-based hpc, strengthening community resource integration, expanding the grassroots medical teams, and conducting systematic public education initiatives. enterprise employees demonstrated a lower preference for lst than public-sector employees. the latter, typically employed within the civil service or other publicly funded institutions, benefit from stable employment and comprehensive welfare coverage [ 49 ]. such conditions appear to cultivate a taken-for-granted trust in the conventional medical paradigm. conversely, a corporate culture prioritizing competition and efficiency heightens enterprise employees cost and risk sensitivity. combined with employment instability, which erodes future security, this dual pressure makes employees confronting chronically diminished quality of life more likely to adopt a pragmatic loss-minimization mindset. this subsequently inclines them to refuse lst. these findings suggest that occupationally shaped daily experiences may ultimately be transformed into an important basis for individuals’ eol choices. limitation there were several limitations in our study. first, this is a cross-sectional study, showing only correlations but no causal relationship between kap and influencing factors. second, the kap of the public for hpc may change over time, but cross-sectional studies are unable to capture such dynamic changes. third, there may be some bias in the representativeness of the sample. considering the sensitivity of the topic and ethical issues, an online survey was designed in this study, and the form of voluntary participation may have brought about bias in the sample, while the respondents attracted in this way may themselves have a higher degree of identification with the hpc topic, leading to biased results. however, at a time when hpc in china is still in its infancy, systematic evaluations from a public perspective are extremely scarce; the sensitivity of the topic and the difficulty of judging it further exacerbate the research gap. despite the biased sample in this study, the results provide preliminary data and hypotheses for subsequent research in this area. future studies can enhance the representativeness and causal inference of the sample through a mixed sampling strategy combining multi-temporal longitudinal tracking, online and offline, as well as an anonymous randomized design, in order to obtain more robust and comprehensive conclusions. conclusion this study revealed the current status and challenges of public kap of hpc. although the public generally has a positive attitude toward hpc, the quality of the public knowledge of hpc needs to be improved and preference varies. education level and household income were associated with knowledge, while attitude was influenced by education level and age. several factors were found to affect public preference, with knowledge playing a positive role in shaping both attitude and preference. traditional cultural concepts and ethics to some extent bring conflict in hpc decision making. therefore, it is recommended to enhance hpc education, reinforce legal protection of acp and ad, introduce culturally appropriate communication tools for family consensus, and establish a home-community mixed care model. these measures are expected to foster greater public participation in hpc. data availability data is available from the corresponding author on reasonable request. abbreviations hpc: hospice and palliative
