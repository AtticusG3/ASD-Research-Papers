## Abstract

Vaccination shows effectiveness at personal and community levels. To manage vaccine demand and supply, effectively promote vaccination, and plan future vaccination strategies, it is crucial to understand the change in the population's willingness over time. Extreme changes in vaccination willingness can affect vaccine oversupply and shortage. Few longitudinal studies have focused on vaccination willingness after the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, we sought to explore temporal changes in COVID-19 vaccination willingness and identify associated variables during and after the pandemic.
A 4-year panel survey was conducted in Japan between January 2020 and March 2024. To evaluate changes in COVID-19 vaccine willingness and identify associated factors, we assessed vaccine hesitancy in September 2022 (i.e., previously vaccinated individuals who did not wish to receive future vaccinations) and unreversed willingness to vaccinate in March 2024 (i.e., previously vaccinated individuals who wished to receive future vaccinations and wished to receive vaccination in September 2022). Modified Poisson regression was performed to examine the predictors of vaccine hesitancy and unreversed willingness to vaccinate.
Vaccination willingness declined from 51.0 % in September 2022 to 19.9 % in March 2024. Man, interest in COVID-19, risk perception, age, and agreement with government policies were negatively associated with vaccine hesitancy. Family experience of infection emerged as a borderline-significant negative factor in unreversed willingness to vaccinate.
Populations with younger populations, women, and people with low dread risk of perception for COVID-19 may have a low initial vaccination demand, which may decrease even after the pandemic ends. Vaccine demand may change within the same population. Therefore, it is crucial to reassess and adjust distribution strategies based on population characteristics.
It is essential to consider these associated factors and adjust the balance between vaccine supply and demand over time to maintain adequate coverage and prevent waste of resources.
