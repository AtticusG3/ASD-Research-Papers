## Abstract

Jasmonates (JAs) play essential roles in plant development and defense. JA perception and responses remain elusive in citrus. Here, we identified core components for JA perception in citrus and elucidated transcriptional changes associated with JA signaling in growth and defense. We showed the F-box protein CORONATINE INSENSITIVE1 (COI1) in citrus is a JA receptor, as
