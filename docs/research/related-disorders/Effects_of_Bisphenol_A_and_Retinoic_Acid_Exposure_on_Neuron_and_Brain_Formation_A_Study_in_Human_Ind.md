## Abstract

Developing human fetuses may be exposed to the chemical compound bisphenol A (BPA), and retinoic acid (RA) has been detected at low levels in water sources. RA signaling regulates key developmental genes and is essential for organ development, including the brain. We previously reported that RA/BPA coexposure of mouse embryonic stem cells potentiates RA signaling, which warrants further investigation. This study was undertaken in human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and zebrafish embryos to investigate whether coexposure to BPA and exogenous RA could potentiate Human iPSCs and zebrafish embryos were exposed to exogenous RA (0, 7.5, 10, 12.5, 100, 200 or In both iPSCs and zebrafish, RA/BPA coexposure had higher expression of 3' Our findings suggest a mechanistic link between chemical exposure and neurodevelopmental impairments and demonstrate involvement of exogenous RA signaling in endocrine disruption. Further investigation is needed to explore why BPA alone did not affect endogenous RA signaling, whereas exogenous RA signaling was potentiated with RA/BPA coexposure. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP15574.
