## Abstract
Suicide is a leading cause of death among females of reproductive age. The menstrual cycle is a plausible yet understudied trigger for acute suicide risk. Cross-sectional studies have demonstrated a greater frequency of suicide attempts and deaths in the weeks before and after the onset of menses compared to other cycle phases. Here, using prospective daily ratings, we examine the relationship between the cycle and suicidal ideation (SI) and related symptoms known to show a cyclical change in some patients (depression, hopelessness, guilt, rejection sensitivity, interpersonal conflict, anxiety, mood swings, and anger/irritability). Thirty-eight naturally cycling outpatients recruited for past-month SI reported SI severity and other symptoms across an average of 40 days. Participants were excluded for hormone use, pregnancy, irregular cycles, serious medical illness, and body mass index > 29.9 or < 18. Intraclass correlations ranged from .29 to .46, highlighting that most symptom variance lies within-person. Cyclical worsening of symptoms was evaluated using phase contrasts in multilevel models. Most symptoms, including SI, were significantly worse in the perimenstrual phase than in all other phases. Additionally, anger/irritability was higher in the midluteal than in the midfollicular phase, and several symptoms of depression were higher in the midfollicular than in the periovulatory phase. Otherwise, symptoms did not significantly differ between the midluteal, midfollicular, and periovulatory phases. Cycle phase predictors accounted for 25% of the within-person variance in SI. Females with SI may be at risk for perimenstrual worsening of SI and related symptoms. These findings highlight the importance of assessing the cycle phase for improved prediction of suicide risk.
