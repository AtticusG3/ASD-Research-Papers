We previously demonstrated that periadolescent depressive-like behaviors occur in a rat model of early-life hypoxia. Here, we investigated the short-term effects of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, sertraline, against later-life behavioral deficits. Rats were exposed to global hypoxia at postnatal day 10 (P10) and then received either sertraline or its vehicle (P24 to P30). Normoxic controls received sertraline or its vehicle. Depressive-like and anxiety-like behaviors were assessed using the forced swim test (FST) and open field test (OFT), respectively. The FST was conducted at P25-26 and the OFT at P27. Rats were sacrificed at P30 to assess hippocampal microRNA (miR) expression and to histologically evaluate hippocampal neuronal densities and synaptophysin (Syp) protein levels. Early-life hypoxic seizures resulted in increased immobility in the FST (p < 0.05) and decreased exploration in the OFT (p < 0.05). Hypoxia also resulted in chronic alterations in the expression of 25 miRs, 22 of which are known to modulate inflammatory responses and synaptic function. Sertraline treatment normalized hypoxia-induced increased immobility and reversed 17 out of 25 alterations in miR expression. However, sertraline potentiated hypoxia-induced exploratory deficits (p < 0.05). The drug treatment also resulted in OFT deficits in controls (p < 0.05) and 13 unique dysregulations in miR expression. Neuronal densities and Syp levels were comparable among all groups. We demonstrate that sertraline reverses hypoxia-induced depressive-like behaviors, possibly by targeting inflammation and synaptic remodeling. Sertraline-induced anxiety-like behaviors may reflect its known transient early side effects and warrant further research on long-term outcomes.## Full Text}org
