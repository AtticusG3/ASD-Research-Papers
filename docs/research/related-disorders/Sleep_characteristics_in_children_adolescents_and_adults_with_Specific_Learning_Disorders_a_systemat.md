## Abstract

Sleep is a fundamental psychophysiological process throughout lifespan, playing a crucial role in memory consolidation and learning. Sleep disturbances are highly prevalent among individuals with neurodevelopmental disorders; however, sleep characteristics and patterns in those with Specific Learning Disorders (SLDs) have been largely overlooked, and a comprehensive systematically synthesis lacks. This systematic review and meta-analysis (PROSPERO ID: CRD42021257350) aims to assess differences in sleep characteristics between individuals with SLDs and controls or individuals with neurodevelopmental disorders other than SLDs. Multiple search strategies identified a total of 13 independent studies, including case-control and cross-sectional designs, with a total sample of 695 children and adolescents and 55 adults with SLDs, and 7459 children and adolescents and 55 adults without SLDs. The risk of bias was evaluated using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale for Assessing the Quality of Nonrandomized Studies in Meta-Analysis. Findings were synthesized narratively and through meta-analysis for both Objective and Subjective sleep outcomes. Meta-analyses of several Objective sleep macroarchitecture parameters showed no difference between groups. Conversely, children and adolescents with SLDs exhibited a significantly higher prevalence of sleep disturbances measured as Subjective outcomes compared to controls without SLDs. This study identifies gaps in literature and outlines priorities for future research.
