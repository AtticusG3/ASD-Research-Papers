## Abstract

Non-adherence to immunosuppression medication (ISM) is common in kidney transplant recipients (KTRs), despite being associated with poor clinical outcomes. Understanding potentially modifiable contributors to non-adherence is essential for developing effective interventions. This study explored the relationship between components of the Common-Sense Model (CSM), including illness perceptions (graft-specific and of kidney disease more broadly) and beliefs about ISM, as well as perceived behavioural control (PBC), and total, intentional and unintentional ISM non-adherence in KTRs. A cross-sectional observational study was conducted with Over half of participants (57%) reported any indication of non-adherence. Unintentional non-adherence was reported more frequently (54%) than intentional non-adherence (14%). Combining CSM components with PBC best explained variance in total (Nagelkerke Enhancing PBC around taking ISM may offer a valuable intervention target, particularly when addressed alongside CSM components to reduce both intentional and unintentional non-adherence.
