## Abstract
Jingqianshu Granules (JQS) is a traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) compound formula originally used to alleviate symptoms of premenstrual syndrome (PMS). Its relevance has become increasingly prominent in the context of premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD), a severe, mood-focused subtype of PMS marked by significant emotional and behavioral disturbances that disrupt daily functioning. JQS holds promising potential for managing PMDD through its multi-component, multi-target therapeutic actions. However, the specific bioactive compounds and underlying mechanisms responsible for its effects remain inadequately understood. Recent pharmacological studies have begun to substantiate its bioactivities, laying the groundwork for further scientific exploration. This study aims to elucidate the active components and pharmacological mechanisms of JQS in the treatment of PMDD. The chemical constituents of JQS were characterized using a serum pharmacology-guided ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with Q-Exactive Orbitrap mass spectrometry (UHPLC-Q Exactive Orbitrap-MS) approach. Active compounds were further identified and screened through the Traditional Chinese Medicine Systems Pharmacology (TCMSP) database and the Swiss Target Prediction platform. To assess pharmacodynamic outcomes, the concentrations of allopregnanolone (ALLO) and serotonin (5-HT) were quantitatively measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The expression patterns of γ-aminobutyric acid type A receptor (GABAAR) subtypes were evaluated via immunofluorescence (IF) analysis, while alterations in inflammatory factor expression were determined by Western blotting (WB). Additionally, patch-clamp recordings were performed on neurons in the basolateral amygdala (BLA) to measure action potentials (AP), resting membrane potential (Vm), and miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (mIPSCs). We successfully identified 514 chemical components within JQS, along with 20 absorbed chemical prototype constituents found in the serum of rats treated with JQS. Of these, 50 % came from the principal drug Bupleurum and Angelica, completely compatible with the theory of Chinese medicine. JQS treatment significantly improved depressive-like behaviors in PMDD model rats, elevated serum levels of ALLO and 5-HT, upregulated the expression of GABAAR α2, α4, and α5 subunits in BLA, and downregulated the expression of inflammatory markers including TLR3, TLR4, TNF-α, TRAF6, TRIF, and MyD88 in the same region. Electrophysiological recordings in BLA neurons revealed that the PMDD model group exhibited decreased frequency and amplitude of mIPSCs, reduced neuronal excitability, and a depolarized resting membrane potential. These abnormalities were effectively reversed by high-dose JQS (JQS-H) and fluoxetine (FLX), restoring inhibitory synaptic transmission and neuronal responsiveness to near-normal levels. This study elucidates the pharmacological basis of JQS in treating PMDD. JQS improved depressive behaviors in PMDD rats by increasing ALLO and 5-HT levels, and reducing neuroinflammation in the BLA. Electrophysiological recordings showed that JQS restored the frequency and amplitude of mIPSCs and normalized resting membrane potential and neuronal excitability in BLA neurons. These findings provide scientific support for the clinical use of JQS and highlight its multi-target mechanisms in modulating mood-related pathways.
