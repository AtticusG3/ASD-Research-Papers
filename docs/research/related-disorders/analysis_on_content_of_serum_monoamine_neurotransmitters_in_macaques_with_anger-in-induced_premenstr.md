## Abstract
To observe the changes in content of monoamine neurotransmitters in the serum of rhesus macaques, and explore the role of serum monoamine neurotransmitters in premenstrual syndrome (PMS) and liver-qi depression induced by anger-in emotion. Social level pressure was applied on 24 female macaques to induce the angry emotional reaction, and then nine of the low-status macaques with anger-in emotional reaction were screened out and were divided into anger-in emotion group, PMS and liver-qi depression group (model group) and Jingqianshu Granule group. Macaques in the last two groups were suffered extruding in a pack cage for inducing PMS liver-qi depression. After 5 d of extruding, experimental animals were evaluated according to the emotional evaluation scale, meanwhile, macaque serum of follicular phase and middle-late luteal phase was collected to analyze the content of serum norepinephrine, dopamine, and 5-hydroxytryptamine. Compared with the normal control group, the scores of depression of the model group and the anger-in emotion group evaluated with emotional evaluation scale were significantly increased (P<0.01, P<0.05); while the score of the model group was significantly higher than that of the anger-in emotion group (P<0.05), and it returned to normal after Jingqianshu Granule treatment. As compared to the normal control group, serum monoamine neurotransmitter levels of the model group and the anger-in emotion group were increased (P<0.05, P<0.01), and the serum monoamine neurotransmitter levels of the model group were significantly higher than those of the anger-in emotion group (P<0.05), while there was no significant difference when compared with the normal control group after the treatment. Anger-in emotion can induce liver-qi depression syndrome which is related to the changes in monoamine neurotransmitters.
