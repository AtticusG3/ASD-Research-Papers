## Abstract

DDX3X syndrome is a neurodevelopmental disorder caused by mutations in the 
An AAV9 (adeno-associated virus serotype 9)-mediated gene supplementation therapy was designed and tested for efficacy and safety in a mouse model of DDX3X syndrome. A total of 182 female 
There was no effect of treatment on early postnatal developmental milestones. At 3 months, a dose-dependent amelioration in anxiety-like behavior was observed in treated 
While the gene therapy design used in this study was not effective, the data suggest that behavior can be modified by altering 
In this study, we evaluated an AAV9-mediated DDX3X gene supplementation therapy in a mouse model of DDX3X syndrome. Mice were treated and assessed for developmental, behavioral, and sleep phenotypes. Treatment provided only limited benefit in
