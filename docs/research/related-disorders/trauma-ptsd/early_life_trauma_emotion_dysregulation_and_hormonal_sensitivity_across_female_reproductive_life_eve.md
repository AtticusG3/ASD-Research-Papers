## Abstract
To explore the relationship between early life trauma, hormonal sensitivity, and psychiatric disorders across female-reproductive life events, with a focus on the neurobiological mechanisms. Childhood trauma significantly increases the risk of subsequent mood disorders during periods of intense hormonal fluctuation such as premenstrual, pregnancy, postpartum, and perimenopause. Neurobiological changes resulting from early trauma influence emotion regulation, which emerges as a key predisposing, exacerbating, and perpetuating factor to hormonal sensitivity and subsequent psychiatric symptoms. We identified altered stress response and allopregnanolone imbalance, bias in cognitive processing of emotions, neuroimage correlates and sleep disturbances as potential underlying neurobiological mechanisms. This review integrates cumulative findings supporting a theoretical framework linking early life trauma to hormonal sensitivity and mood disorders. We propose that some women might be more susceptible to such hormonal fluctuations because of emotion dysregulation following significant early life trauma.
