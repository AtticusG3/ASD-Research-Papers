## Abstract

Schizophrenia, a chronic mental health condition, is characterized by abnormalities in perception, emotions and behavior. We successfully generated induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of a patient with schizophrenia and neurodevelopmental delay who responded well to olanzapine therapy. The iPSCs exhibited a normal karyotype, expressed markers of undifferentiated human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs), and differentiated into the three germ layers in vivo.
