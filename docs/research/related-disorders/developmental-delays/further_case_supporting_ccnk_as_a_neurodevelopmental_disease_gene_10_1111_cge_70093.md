# A Further Case Supporting CCNK as a Neurodevelopmental Disease Gene.

**Authors:** ['ClaraXiol', 'JonathanOlival', 'LoretoMartorell', 'Juan DaríoOrtigoza-Escobar']

## Abstract

De novo CCNK missense variant associated with mild intellectual disability, subtle dysmorphism (hypertelorism, depressed/broad nasal bridge), and ventriculomegaly. This case broadens the clinical spectrum of CCNK-related neurodevelopmental disease and supports cyclin K as a disease gene; imaging and phenotype suggest a milder presentation compared with deletions.
