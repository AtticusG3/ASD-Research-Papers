## Abstract

Schizophrenia is a severe mental disorder associated with behavioural, cognitive, and emotional impairments. There are several leading theories on schizophrenia etilology, including genetic, neurotransmitter (dopamine and GABA-glutamate are the leading ones), immunological (microglial, cytokine, kynurenine) and neurodevelopmental (neuro-ontogenetic and neurodegenerative) theories. Despite the fact that in recent decades, the greatest efforts have been directed towards testing and developing genetic and neurotransmitter (including dopamine) theories, the recent evidence suggests that immunological aspects, in particular neuroinflammation (cytokine hypothesis) may play an important role in schizophrenia. Neuroinflammation in schizophrenia is thought to be mediated primarily by the activation of resident immune cells such as microglia. However, peripheral immune cells, which migrate through the blood-brain barrier into the central nervous system (CNS) are also involved in the development of neuroinflammation. Among the infiltrating cells that cause neuroinflammation, CD4
