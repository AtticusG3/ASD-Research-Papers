## Abstract

Butylparaben (BP) is a chemical commonly used as a preservative, but it is an endocrine-disrupting chemical (EDC) with estrogenic activity in humans when exposed through various routes. Although the adverse effects of BP have been confirmed, the neurodevelopmental toxicity of BP is still unclear. The neurotoxic effects of BP were confirmed in vitro, leading to an investigation of its impact on the neurodevelopment of mouse offspring in this study. BP caused a reduction in cell viability (IC
