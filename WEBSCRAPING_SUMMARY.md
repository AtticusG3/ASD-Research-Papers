## Technical Approach

### Source Discovery
1. **DOI Resolution:** Used DOI resolution services to find publisher URLs
2. **Alternative Sources:** Tried PubMed Central direct access and Google Scholar
3. **Open Access Detection:** Checked for open access versions using Unpaywall API

### Content Extraction
1. **Multiple Strategies:** Implemented various content detection methods
2. **Improved Parsing:** Enhanced HTML parsing to handle different website structures
3. **Content Validation:** Ensured minimum content length and quality

### Challenges Encountered
1. **Paywall Restrictions:** Many papers were behind publisher paywalls
2. **Dynamic Content:** Some sites used JavaScript for content loading
3. **Content Detection:** Different websites had varying HTML structures
4. **Rate Limiting:** Implemented delays to be respectful to servers

## Files Created

### Scripts
- `scripts/find_papers_to_scrape.py` - Identifies papers needing scraping
- `scripts/webscrape_next_20_papers.py` - Initial scraping attempt
- `scripts/improved_webscraper.py` - Retry with alternative sources

### Data Files
- `papers_to_scrape_next_20.yaml` - List of 20 papers to scrape
- `acquired_papers/webscraping_log_20251021_183319.yaml` - Initial scraping results
- `acquired_papers/retry_scraping_log_20251021_183521.yaml` - Retry results

### Scraped Content
- 9 new markdown files in `docs/research/tourette/` directory
- Total content: ~406,000 characters of research text
- All files include proper YAML frontmatter with metadata

## Success Metrics

- **45% success rate** for finding and scraping full-text content
- **9 new papers** added to the research database
- **~406K characters** of additional research content
- **Comprehensive metadata** preserved for all scraped papers
- **Full audit trail** maintained in YAML logs

## Recommendations for Future Scraping

1. **Focus on Open Access Sources:** Prioritize papers from open access journals
2. **Institutional Access:** Consider partnering with institutions for paywalled content
3. **Alternative Formats:** Try PDF scraping for papers available as PDFs
4. **Manual Curation:** For high-priority papers, consider manual acquisition
5. **Regular Updates:** Implement periodic re-scraping for failed papers

## Next Steps

1. **Review Scraped Content:** Verify quality and completeness of scraped papers
2. **Process Remaining Papers:** Continue with next batch of 20 papers
3. **Improve Success Rate:** Refine scraping strategies based on lessons learned
4. **Update Documentation:** Maintain comprehensive logs for future reference
